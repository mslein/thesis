Recent studies highlight the importance of identifying the role of marine coastal communities in carbon exchanges. Our objective was to couple macrozoobenthos abundance data from long-term monitoring with species metabolism rates to contribute to the estimation of CO2 fluxes from an intertidal exposed rocky shore community at a regional scale. The carbon fluxes due to respiration and calcification were calculated both during emersion and immersion, and the effect of temperature variation on carbon emissions was then predicted. Spatial and temporal natural variations of carbon fluxes were investigated and the contribution of exposed intertidal rocky shore communities to regional carbon emissions was calculated. The method was used to calculate the carbon budget allowed to account for the natural spatial variability of the community composition and carbon emissions. Mean annual calculated CO2 emission was 14.3molCm-2yr-2, and the annual regional CO2 flux was estimated at 2978tCyr-1. Simulations showed that the potential feedback of a rise in temperature of 1C would lead to an increase of 4-7% in carbon emissions for this type of community. The results give a first quantification of intertidal exposed rocky shore carbon emissions that could be considered in evaluating further the global CO2 budget.  2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

In this study, responses of biological performance and sludge microbiota to the long-term day/night temperature differences (DNTD) were investigated in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). The results showed that the functional bacteria could sustained their ecological functions at low DNTD (20/30 C), resulting in relatively stable performance with respect to nutrient removal. However, when the activated sludge was subjected to a high DNTD (17/33 C), the effluent concentrations of COD, TN and TP were significantly higher in MBR-B than that in MBR-A. In addition, more severe membrane fouling occurred under the perturbation of high DNTD as revealed by the transmembrane pressure (TMP) profile, which was mainly attributed to the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that DNTD showed negligible effect on the bacterial community structures. Nonetheless, the functional bacteria responded differently to DNTD, which were in accordance with the bioreactor performances. Specifically, Nitrospina (NOB) and Tetrasphaera (PAOs) appeared to be sensitive to both low and high DNTD. In contrast, a low DNTD showed marginal effects on the denitrifiers, while a high DNTD significantly decreased their abundances. More strikingly, filamentous bulking bacteria were found to be well-adapted to DNTD, indicating their tolerance to the daily temperature fluctuation. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the response of microbial ecology of activated sludge to daily temperature variations in full-scale MBRs.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Organisms exposed to high temperature stresses typically protect themselves with a heat shock response (HSR), where accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the synthesis of heat shock proteins through the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. While the molecular mechanisms are qualitatively well characterized, our quantitative understanding of the underlying dynamics is still very limited. Here, we study the dynamics of HSR in the photosynthetic model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a data-driven mathematical model of HSR. We based our dynamical model mostly on mass action kinetics, with a few nonlinear terms. The model was parametrized and validated by several independent datasets obtained from the literature. We demonstrate that HSR quantitatively and significantly differs if an increase in temperature of the same magnitude occurs abruptly, as often applied under laboratory conditions, or gradually, which would rather be expected under natural conditions. In contrast to rapid temperature increases, under gradual changes only negligible amounts of misfolded proteins accumulate, indicating that the HSR of C. reinhardtii efficiently avoids the accumulation of misfolded proteins under conditions most likely to prevail in nature. The mathematical model we developed is a flexible tool to simulate the HSR to different conditions and complements the current experimental approaches.  2018 The Authors.","Article","Scopus","142","20170965","selected",""

Two important and connected topics have been largely ignored in this context: (i) the increase of daily temperature variation (DTV) as a key component of climate change, and (ii) differences in sensitivity to climate change and contaminants between developmental stages. We therefore investigated whether DTV magnified the negative effects of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos on mortality and heat tolerance and whether this effect was stronger in aquatic larvae than in terrestrial adults of the mosquito Culex pipiens. Exposure to chlorpyrifos at a constant temperature imposed mortality and reduced the heat tolerance in both larvae and adult males, but not in adult females. This provides the first evidence that the TICS (toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity) concept can be sex-specific. DTV had no direct negative effects. Yet, consistent with the CITS (climate-induced toxicant sensitivity) concept, DTV magnified the toxicity of the pesticide in terms of larval mortality. This was not the case in the adult stage indicating the CITS concept to be dependent on the developmental stage. Notably, chlorpyrifos reduced the heat tolerance of adult females only in the presence of DTV, thereby providing support for the reciprocal effects between DTV and contaminants, hence the coupling of the TICS and CITS concepts. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of integrating DTV and the developmental stage to improve risk assessment of contaminants under climate change.  2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

The nonlinear relationship between temperature and biological processes means that fluctuating temperatures lead to physiological, life history, and ecological consequences for ectothermic insects that diverge from those predicted from constant temperatures. Fluctuating temperatures that remain within permissive temperature ranges generally improve performance. By contrast, those which extend to stressful temperatures may have either positive impacts, allowing repair of damage accrued during exposure to thermal extremes, or negative impacts from cumulative damage during successive exposures. We discuss the mechanisms underlying these differing effects.

In this study, the effects of temperature on the anoxic metabolism of nitrite (NO-2) to nitrous oxide (N2O) by polyphosphate accumulating organisms, and the process of the accumulation of N2O (during nitrite reduction), which acts as an electron acceptor, were investigated using 91%  4% Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis sludge. The results showed that N2O is accumulated when Accumulibacter first utilize nitrite instead of oxygen as the sole electron acceptor during the denitrifying phosphorus removal process. Properties such as nitrite reduction rate, phosphorus uptake rate, N2O reduction rate, and polyhydroxyalkanoate degradation rate were all influenced by temperature variation (over the range from 10 to 30C reaching maximum values at 25C). The reduction rate of N2O by N2O reductase was more sensitive to temperature when N2O was utilized as the sole electron acceptor instead of NO2, and the N2O reduction rates, ranging from 0.48 to 3.53 N2O-N/(hrg VSS), increased to 1.45 to 8.60 mg N2O-N/(hrg VSS).

As ocean warming continues, performance of marine species will be impacted. Many studies have focused on how warming will impact physiology, life history, and behavior, but few studies have investigated how ecological and behavioral traits of organisms will affect their response to changing thermal environments. Here, we assessed the thermal tolerances and thermal sensitivity of swimming performance of two sympatric mysid shrimp species of the Northwest Atlantic. Neomysis americana and Heteromysis formosa overlap in habitat and many aspects of their ecological niche, but only N. americana exhibits vertical migration. In temperate coastal ecosystems, temperature stratification of the water column exposes vertical migrators to a wider range of temperatures on a daily basis. We found that N. americana had a significantly lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, both mysid species had a buffer of at least 4 C between their CTmax and the 100-year projection for mean summer water temperatures of 28 C. Swimming performance of the vertically migrating species was more sensitive to temperature variation, and this species exhibited faster burst swimming speeds. The generalist performance curve of H. formosa and specialist curve of N. americana are consistent with predictions based on the exposure of each species to temperature variation such that higher within-generation variability promotes specialization. However, these species violate the assumption of the specialist-generalist tradeoff in that the area under their performance curves is not constant. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating species-specific responses to temperature based on the ecology and behavior of organisms into climate change prediction models.  2016","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Moreover, despite the increasing interest for the toxicity of pesticide mixtures how this is influenced by temperature has been largely ignored. We tested whether daily temperature variation (DTV) magnifies the toxicity of two pesticides with a different mode of action, the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), and of their mixture in the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Single exposure to CPF and Bti increased mortality and reduced female development time, and exposure to CPF also increased female wing length. DTV was not lethal and did not change the toxicity of the individual pesticides. Yet, a key novel finding was that high DTV increased the mortality of the mixture by changing the interaction between both pesticides from additive to synergistic. Given that in nature daily temperature variation is omnipresent, this is important both for vector control and for ecological risk assessment. The higher toxicity of the mixture at high DTV compared to the typically used constant test temperatures in the laboratory urges caution when evaluating the environmental impact of pesticide mixtures.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

The animals were then examined under three equal 4-day periods: ad libitum feeding, fasting and re-feeding. Through the analysis of daily as well as short-term, or ultradian, variations of body temperature, we showed that while ducklings at TN show only a modest decline in daily thermoregulatory parameters when fasted, they exhibit reduced surface temperatures from key sites of vascular heat exchange during fasting. The CA birds, on the other hand, significantly reduced their short-term variations of body temperature while increasing long-term variability when fasting. This phenomenon would allow the CA birds to reduce the energetic cost of body temperature maintenance under fasting.

Differential scanning calorimetric analysis revealed that the TRPU synthesized in this study exhibited segmented structure with partially-miscible fixed phase and reversible phase, which favorably imparted the TRPU a physiologically-tolerable switching temperature at 44 C. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy demonstrated that, as the TRPU underwent sharp phase transition upon heating through 44 C, the free volume size and fraction within the polymeric matrix expanded dramatically. Based on such discontinuous free volume change, the diffusion of incorporated antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) and anticancer drug (paclitaxel) from TRPU membrane could be switched off below normal physiological temperature (37 C) while switched on by heating to 44 C, resulting in high on-off ratios. In addition, the TRPU membrane could be thermally-switched on and off rapidly, within less than 5 min after temperature variation, and reproducibly, over four cycles of temperature oscillation between 37 C and 44 C.

Changes in the advective and thermal environment in nearshore waters have been inferred from ecological patterns, since analyses of in situ physical data have thus far been missing. Here we analyze a unique set of shoreline temperature data, gathered over 4- 10 years at 15 sites between 28-35S, and combine it with satellite-derived winds and sea surface temperatures to investigate the latitudinal transition in nearshore oceanographic conditions suggested by recent ecological studies. Our results show a marked transition in thermal conditions at 30-31S, superimposed on a broad latitudinal trend, and smallscale structures associated with cape-and-bay topography. The seasonal cycle dominated temperature variability throughout the region, but its relative importance decreased abruptly south of 30-31S, as variability at synoptic and intra-seasonal scales became more important. The response of shoreline temperatures to meridional wind stress also changed abruptly at the transition, leading to a sharp drop in the occurrence of low-temperature waters at northern sites, and a concurrent decrease in corticated algal biomass. Together, these results suggest a limitation of nitrate availability in nearshore waters north of the transition. The localized alongshore change results from the interaction of latitudinal trends (e.g., wind stress, surface warming, inertial period) with a major headland-bay system (Punta Lengua de Vaca at 30.25S), which juxtaposes a southern stretch of coast characterized by upwelling with a northern stretch of coast characterized by warm surface waters and stratification. This transition likely generates a number of latitude-dependent controls on ecological processes in the nearshore that can explain species-specific effects, and add strength to the suggestion of an oceanography-driven, major spatial transition in coastal communities at 30-31S.

The total CO2-eq emission amount at 35 C was 45.6% and 153.4% higher than that at 25 C and 15 C, respectively. During partial nitrification, the microbial community diversity greatly declined compared with seed sludge. However, the diversity was enhanced at low temperature. The abundance of Betaproteobacteria at class level increased greatly during partial nitrification. Proteobacteria abundance declined while Nitrospira raised at low temperature.

Studies using variable thermal environments can improve ecological relevance of data because organisms naturally face day-to-day stochastic temperature fluctuations as well as seasonal changes in the amplitude of such daily fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate if, and to what extent, the use of constant temperatures is justified in studies of the model species, yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria (L.). We examined the effect of temperature fluctuation on the expression of several life history traits and the effect on subsequent adult longevity. We used two fluctuating temperature treatments with the same mean but different amplitudes (15/21C, 12/24C; 12/12 h), and three constant temperature treatments spanning the wide temperature range faced in the wild (12, 18, and 24C). Large temperature fluctuation was mostly detrimental (lower juvenile survival, slower growth, smaller body size, and longer development), whereas moderate temperature fluctuation usually gave responses similar to the constant regime. When developing in fluctuating temperatures, adult longevity (no effect), body size (lower), and wing shape (narrower wings) deviated from the expectations based on the constant temperature reaction norms, presumably because of acclimation responses. Contrary to some studies no obvious beneficial effects of moderate temperature fluctuation were observed. Instead, yellow dung flies seem to canalize development in the face of temperature fluctuation up to a point when detrimental effects become unavoidable. The relatively greater effects of extreme constant developmental temperatures question their biological relevance in experiments.  2013 Entomological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

The cold water event occurs daily with duration of a few hours, a time scale much longer than that of the ISW. To further understand the physical process, a detailed numerical simulation on the interaction of the Dongsha Atoll and the ISW is carried out using the Princeton Ocean Model. Internal solitary waves are found to merge, become asymmetric, and break in the shoaling process. Then, a violent tidal bore forms and runs up the slope as a bolus, bringing up cold deep water to the shallows. The simulated temperature variation and flow field in November are very similar to the largest temperature drop in the field measurement where the flow field is dominated by the ISW. In the merging process, three ISWs become one longer wave lengthening the time scale of the cooling process compared with that of a single ISW. The step around the atoll also contributes substantially by increasing the exposure time of the local ecosystem to the cold deep water. The same calculation in the absence of the step yields a much shorter time for the cold water cycle.  2010 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

To reap the benefits of the local primary production, species need to cope with a number of constraints among which low oxygen is probably the most basic. This hypoxia is further complicated by the highly variable temperature these species experience. We studied the response of deep-sea hydrothermal species of scale worms (Annelida, Polynoidae) to varying levels of oxygen and showed that they were capable of compensating a decrease of environmental oxygen concentration (= oxyregulators), down to values of about 30 mol l1. This contrasts with shallow-water temperate species, for which oxygen consumption is directly proportional to its concentration (= oxyconformers). We measured oxygen consumption rates in 11 species from hydrothermal vents, as well as 2 species from the general deep-sea, and compared them to three shallow-water species. Life-style (free-living vs. commensal) and habitat of origin (shallow-water, deep-sea, and hydrothermal vent) did not affect oxygen consumption rates. In agreement with thermodynamic expectations, as temperature increases, oxygen consumption increases as well for all species. The sensitivity of oxygen consumption to temperature variation in the shallow-water species is however smaller than that from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent species. This unexpected result could correspond to a pronounced increase of activity (avoidance behaviour) in the vent species, which was not observed for the shallow-water species.  2021","Article","Scopus",NA,"103531","selected",""

This temperature difference between urban and rural areas occurs due to different land uses / land covers (LULC), which have distinct thermal characteristics among them. Vegetation areas increase evapotranspiration to reduce thermal loading, while urban constructed materials store and reemit incident energy into the environment. Other factors such as the urban geometry (i.e., size, shape, height, and arrangement of buildings) and the presence of anthropogenic thermal emission sources (i.e., automobile and industrial process) can affect the UHI phenomenon. Multiple environmental implications as well as changes in the biological environment can be related to UHI. In aquatic ecosystems, for example, UHI affect not only the water temperature, but also the stability of water column, biogeochemical cycles and biological activity. Thus, urban aquatic systems, usually used as a source of water for the population, are affected by the UHI phenomenon. This chapter is reviewing few concepts about the impacts of air temperature variations on urban aquatic systems: a physical and ecological overview. Therefore, concepts of physical impacts of air temperature variation on the water column stability as well as its impacts on the biological activity are described in this chapter. It also presents a summary of the theoretical background of physical processes of one important tool for the studies on UHI: the thermal remote sensing.

Accordingly, the chemical compounds present in the material wasps use to build their nests can both facilitate communication and repel predators. It is herein hypothesized that different wasp species build their nests with different structure and substrate materials and that such materials consist of chemical compounds related to unique wasp behavior and outside temperature variation. To test this hypothesis, nests were collected from three species of social wasps, the samples of which were subjected to temperature variation under laboratory conditions. The compounds present in the substrate were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Chemical compounds identified in the nest material of the three species responded differently to temperature variation. Chemical compounds from Polybia nests were altered significantly when subjected to temperature variation, whereas the nests of Polistes versicolor did not significantly change in relation to the control. The differences found between Polistes and Polybia nests may be related to genetic factors, but also to the type of nest they construct. It is possible that divergent evolutionary strategies for maintaining colony temperature, as a function of the chemical composition of the nests, may have appeared between wasps that have open and closed nests. In relatively small colonies, nest substrate is more resistant to temperature variation because it is composed of a greater diversity of elements and thus capable of holding heavier, longer carbon chains. Our results suggest that chemical compounds in the nest material of the three wasp species analysed responded differently to fluctuating ambient temperatures and that such variation could result from the biochemical differences of unique wasp species or from thermoregulation strategies of colonies.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Nevertheless, infectious diseases have threatened species with extinction on local scales by maintaining high incidence and the ability to spread efficiently even as host populations decline. Intertidal black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii ), but not other abalone species, went extinct locally throughout much of southern California following the emergence of a Rickettsiales-like pathogen in the mid-1980s. The rickettsial disease, a condition known as withering syndrome (WS), and associated mortality occur at elevated water temperatures. We measured abalone body temperatures in the field and experimentally manipulated intertidal environmental conditions in the laboratory, testing the influence of mean temperature and daily temperature variability on key epizootiological processes of WS. Daily temperature variability increased the susceptibility of black abalone to infection, but disease expression occurred only at warm water temperatures and was independent of temperature variability. These results imply that high thermal variation of the marine intertidal zone allows the pathogen to readily infect black abalone, but infected individuals remain asymptomatic until water temperatures periodically exceed thresholds modulating WS. Mass mortalities can therefore occur before pathogen transmission is limited by density-dependent factors.  2013 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911- 2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.

The tissue effect depends on the cumulative heating that occurs in the vicinity of the moving blade electrode. In this work, a continuum thermomechanical model based on mixture theory, which accounts for the multiphase nature of soft hydrated tissues and includes transport and evaporation losses, is used to capture the transient heating effect of a moving electrode. The model takes into account the dependence of electrical conductivity and the evaporation rate on the water content in the tissue, as it changes in response to heating. Temperature prediction is validated with mean experimental temperature measured during in situ experiments performed on porcine liver tissue at different power settings of the electrosurgical unit. The model is shown to closely capture the temperature variation in the tissue for three distinct scenarios; with no visible cutting or coagulation damage at a low 10 W power setting, with coagulation damage but no tissue cutting at an intermediate power setting of 25 W, and with both coagulation and tissue cutting at a higher power setting of 50 W. Furthermore, an Arrhenius model is shown to capture tissue damage observed in the experiments. Increase in applied power was found to correlate with tissue cutting and concentrated damage near the electrode, but had little effect on the observed coagulation damage width.

Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 C and 25 C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over functional traits.

To cope with these effects, copepods have developed several protective systems, including avoiding extended and intense periods of exposure. How much UV-B exposure a cohort of thousands of spawners can withstand remains unknown. To evaluate the post-exposure effects of UV-B radiation on reproduction in egg-carrying copepods, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that integrates in vivo data. We calibrated the IBM for a small cyclopoid copepod species, Paracyclopina nana, which is a biological model used in both ecotoxicology and aquaculture. Our findings improve our understanding of the species response to UV-B radiation. Significant radiative effects include decreased reproductive success (at  0.7 kJ.m  2) and offspring production (at 0.6  kJ.m  2). The model predicted fewer than 500 females from an original cohort of 1000 would survive for five days after exposure to 1 kJ/m2, and 50% offspring suppression eight days after exposure to 1 kJ.m  2. This integrative model highlighted the importance of female longevity in maintaining a viable population at doses below 2 kJ.m  2 and that of hatching success for radiation levels exceeding 2 kJ.m  2.

The change in annual average temperature (annual T) variations in Northeast China since the Industrial Revolution are still not fully understood, mainly because of the lack of long-term instrumental data and high-resolution annual T reconstructions. Here, we present the first annual T reconstruction (r = 0.683, p &lt;.001, n = 60) for 18182012 in Northeast China, which may also be the first temperature reconstruction based on tree-ring 18O in China. The reconstruction is significantly related to temperature variations over mid-high latitude Eurasia and agree (p &lt;.01) with several long-term hydroclimatic reconstructions in the surrounding area. When the internal variability in the reconstruction was high, the decadal to multidecadal cycles were significant. Further analysis found that the reconstruction was mainly affected by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The reconstruction was significantly negatively correlated with several time series of annual T in the Northern Hemisphere, which showed that there is a substantial difference in annual T between Northeast China and other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The difference mainly existed before the 1950s. From the 1850s to the 1950s, the annual T in Northeast China decreased slightly. However, extreme warming began in the 1950s in Northeast China, and this warming has been unprecedented during the past two centuries.

The treatment is performed within a clinical MRI to obtain real-time MR thermometry used as an active feedback to control the spatial heating pattern in the prostate and to monitor for potential damage to surrounding tissues. This requires that the MR thermometry measurements are an accurate representation of the true tissue temperature. The proton resonance frequency shift thermometry method used is sensitive to tissue motion and changes in the local magnetic susceptibility that can be caused by the motion of air bubbles in the rectum, which can impact the performance of transurethral MR-HIFU in these regions of the gland. 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Methods: A method is proposed for filtering of temperature artifacts based on the temporal variance of the temperature, using empirical and dynamic positional knowledge of the ultrasonic heating beam, and an estimation of the measurement noise. A two-step correction strategy is introduced which eliminates artifact-detected temperature variations while keeping the noise level low through spatial averaging. Results: The filter has been evaluated by postprocessing data from five human transurethral ultrasound treatments. The two-step correction process led to reduced final temperature standard deviation in the prostate and rectum areas where the artifact was located, without negatively affecting areas distal to the artifact. The performance of the filter was also found to be consistent across all six of the data sets evaluated. The evaluation of the detection criterion parameter M determined that a value of M = 3 achieves a conservative filter with minimal loss of spatial resolution during the process. Conclusions: The filter was able to remove most artifacts due to the presence of moving air bubbles in the rectum during transurethral MR-HIFU. A quantitative estimation of the filter capabilities shows a systematic improvement in the standard deviation of the corrected temperature maps in the rectum zone as well as in the entire acquired slice.","Article","Scopus","11","113302","excluded",""

The current study presents the impact of air temperature variation on forest fire occurrences in Central Indian region during 2003-2010. The decadal (2001-2010) fire events in Central India were analysed in relation to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to characterise the regional impact of climate on fire occurrences. The study shows the exponential relation of fire with LST and rise in air temperature. There exists an inverse relation between spatial patterns of fire and EVI, which represents the intra-annual variability in fire incidences during the summer season in Central Indian region. Majority of the fire incidences are recoded in the March month of every year with highest rank in the year 2009.

Insects that experience repeated freeze-thaw cycles over winter will cross this stressor threshold many times over their lifespan. Here, we examined the effect of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term physiological parameters (metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance (survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed overwintering prepupae to a series of low temperatures (-10, -15 or -20C) with increasing numbers of freezing events (3, 6 or 10) with differing recovery periods between events (1, 5 or 10 days). Repeated freezing increased sorbitol concentration by about 50% relative to a single freezing episode, and prompted prepupae to modify long-chain triacylglycerols to acetylated triacylglycerols. Long-term, repeated freezing did not significantly reduce survival but did reduce egg production by 9.8% relative to a single freezing event. Exposure temperature did not affect any of these measures, suggesting that threshold crossing events may be more important to fitness than the intensity of stress in overwintering E.

To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus] and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

The model has been implemented using a version of the ""Brooks Man"" anatomical data set, consisting of 1.3 108 cubic volume elements (voxels) measuring 0.2 cm/side. The model simulates thermoregulation through passive mechanisms (metabolism, blood flow, respiration, and transpiration) and active mechanisms (vasodilatation, vasoconstriction, sweating, and shivering). Compared with lumped or compartment models, a voxel model is capable of high spatial resolution and can capture a level of anatomical detail not achievable otherwise. A high spatial resolution model can predict detailed heating patterns from localized or nonuniform heating patterns, such as from some radio frequency sources. Exposures to warm and hot environments (ambient temperatures of 33-48C) were simulated with the current voxel model and with a recent compartment model. Results from the two models (core temperature, skin temperature, metabolic rate, and evaporative cooling rate) were compared with published experimental results obtained under similar conditions. Under the most severe environmental conditions considered (47.8C, 27% RH for 2 h), the voxel model predicted a rectal temperature increase of 0.56C, compared with a core temperature increase of 0.45C from the compartment model and an experimental mean rectal temperature increase of 0.6C. Similar, good agreement was noted for other thermal variables and under other environmental conditions. Results suggest that the voxel model is capable of predicting temperature response (core temperature and skin temperature) to certain warm or hot environments, with accuracy comparable to that of a compartment model. In addition, the voxel model is able to predict internal tissue temperatures and surface temperatures, over time, with a level of specificity and spatial resolution not achievable with compartment models. The development of voxel models and related computational tools may be useful for thermal dosimetry applications involving mild temperature hyperthermia and for the assessment of safe exposure to certain nonionizing radiation sources.

To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20C), low fluctuation (205C), or high fluctuation (2012C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.  2020 Company of Biologists Ltd.

Additionally, in some aquatic systems daily water temperature fluctuations may influence these processes and alter contaminant toxicity, but such temperature fluctuations are rarely examined in conjunction with contaminants. In this study, the shredding amphipod Hyalella azteca was exposed to the fungicide pyraclostrobin in three experiments. Endpoints included mortality, organism growth, and leaf processing. One experiment was conducted at a constant temperature (23 C), a fluctuating temperature regime (18-25 C) based on field-collected data from the S. Llano River, Texas, or an adjusted fluctuating temperature regime (20-26 C) based on possible climate change predictions. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced leaf shredding and increased H. azteca mortality at concentrations of 40 g/L or greater at a constant 23 C and decreased leaf shredding at concentrations of 15 g/L or greater in the fluctuating temperatures. There was a significant interaction between temperature treatment and pyraclostrobin concentration on H. azteca mortality, body length, and dry mass under direct aqueous exposure conditions. In an indirect exposure scenario in which only leaf material was exposed to pyraclostrobin, H. azteca did not preferentially feed on or avoid treated leaf disks compared to controls.

As such, prediction models that utilize temperature for estimating future bark beetle locations and consequential tree mortality are critical for informing forest management decision-making in an attempt to mitigate and adapt to pending and current outbreaks. This is especially true for physiological models that account for the effects of overwinter temperatures on bark beetle survival, as seasonal temperatures, specifically during winter months, exert the greatest impact on bark beetle mortality during various stages of life cycle development. Yet, how temperature observations are used to predict bark beetle survival can significantly under- or over-estimate the role that temperature variability plays in annual tree mortality, especially under current climate change trajectories. This study evaluates how representations of winter temperature influence bark beetle survival estimates. Using the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) across the western USA as a case study, single-year to decade-long winter temperature averages were used as inputs into a physiological beetle survival prediction model, the results of which were compared against beetle-induced tree mortality observations using temporal autoregressive models. Results show that using longer-term survival averages of seven to ten years significantly increases the likelihood that temperature alone can predict general levels of beetle survival and hence beetle-induced mortality. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the role of long-term temperature observations when forecasting bark beetle outbreaks, and that year-to-year temperature variability may be constrained in predicting beetle survival during outbreak periods.  2019 by the authors.","Article","Scopus","10","866","selected",""

A simple voltage comparator is used to compare the filter output voltages and measure the temperature-dependent crossing time. The comparator output voltage is compared with the reference voltage by using an XOR gate, of which the output is a squarewave with a temperature-dependent duty cycle.

Because this process leads to a loss of function of the affected polypeptides and to cytotoxic stress, formation of protein aggregates has been recognized as a major pathogenic factor in human diseases. In this study, we determined the impact of physiological heat stress on mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. We found that the heat-stressed mitochondria had lower membrane potential and ATP level and exhibited a decreased production of reactive oxygen species. An analysis of the mitochondrial proteome by 2D PAGE showed that the overall solubility of endogenous proteins was only marginally affected by elevated temperatures. However, a small subset of polypeptides exhibited an high sensitivity to heat stress. The mitochondrial translation elongation factor Tu (Tufm), a protein essential for organellar protein biosynthesis, was highly aggregation-prone and lost its solubility already under mild heat-stress conditions. Moreover, mitochondrial translation and the import of cytosolic proteins were defective in the heat-stressed mitochondria. Both types of nascent polypeptides, produced by translation or imported into the mitochondria, exhibited a strong tendency to aggregate in the heat-exposed mitochondria. We propose that a fast and specific inactivation of elongation factors may prevent the accumulation of misfolded nascent polypeptides and may thereby attenuate proteotoxicity under heat stress.  2018 Wilkening et al.","Article","Scopus","29",NA,"excluded",""

When the temperature decreases below -5C, the liquid water in the cyanobacterial cells may freeze. In the natural environment, the temperature gradually decreases from autumn to winter, and the diurnal temperatures fluctuate enormously. It was hypothesized that the physiology of cyanobacterial cells changes in later autumn to acclimatize the cells to the upcoming freezing temperatures. In the present study, an incubation experiment in growth chambers was designed to stimulate the responses of cyanobacterial cells to diurnal temperature variations before freezing in late autumn. The results showed that ""light"" cyanobacterial soil crusts are more tolerant to diurnal temperature fluctuations than ""dark"" cyanobacterial soil crusts. After the first diurnal temperature cycle between 24 and -4Cf, the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents increased and the photosynthetic activity decreased. The superoxide dismutase activity increased, more extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were secreted and the ratios of the light-harvesting and light-screening pigments decreased. With increasing numbers of diurnal temperature cycles, the MDA contents and photosynthetic activity gradually returned to their initial levels. Our results suggest that there are at least three pathways by which crust-forming cyanobacteria acclimate to the diurnal temperature cycles in the late autumn in the Hopq Desert, Northwest China. These three pathways include increased secretion of EPS, regulation of the ratios of light-harvesting and light-screening pigments, and activation of the antioxidant system.

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15  0.5 C) or variable (narrowly variable: 1317 C day1 or widely variable 1121 C day1) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15  0.5 C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where Ucrit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum Ucrit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62  0.44 BL s1 at 15 C; narrowly variable: 4.52  0.23 BL s1 at 21 C; widely variable: 3.90  0.24 BL s1 at 11 C, mean  s.e.m.).

This is puzzling because tropical ectotherms, being thermal specialists, face a harsher abiotic environment and competition from temperate residents that are thermal generalists. We develop a mathematical framework to address this puzzle. We find that (i) tropical ectotherms can invade temperate habitats if they have higher consumption rates and lower mortality during warmer summers, (ii) stronger seasonal fluctuations at higher latitudes create more temporal niches, allowing coexistence of tropical invaders and temperate residents, and (iii) temperate ectotherms' failure to invade tropical habitats is due to greater mortality rather than lower competitive ability. Our framework yields predictions about population-level outcomes of invasion success based solely on species' trait responses to temperature. It provides a potential ecological explanation for why the tropics constitute both a cradle and a museum of biodiversity.  2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In the ecological restoration of such abandoned land, the use of certain types of mulch and legume is efficient and effective. In this research, three mulching methods, including a straw blanket (SB), bark plot (BP) and wood shavings (WS), and a control plot (CP) were evaluated over separate growing seasons to determine their effects on the vegetation biomass and the soil physicochemical properties, including soil temperature and soil moisture. The results indicated that mulching had multiple benefits, including improved vegetation growth by decreasing soil evaporation and regulating the soil temperature. SB and BP were the preferred materials because they were more effective. The wood shavings method did not favor the establishment of vegetation and resulted in vegetation similar to that of the control plot. In addition, the legumes Amorpha fruticosa, Lespedeza bicolor and Medicago sativa significantly enhanced the soil physicochemical properties. Thus, the straw blanket, bark plot mulch are recommended for a beneficial water retention effect on topsoil and vegetation growth of abandoned land.

Yet, the mechanisms regulating phytoplankton diversity in freshwater ecosystems are not fully understood, especially in peri-urban environments where anthropogenic pressures strongly impact the quality of aquatic ecosystems. To address this issue, we sampled the phytoplankton communities of 50 lakes in the Paris area (France) characterized by a large gradient of physico-chemical and catchment-scale characteristics. We used large phytoplankton datasets to describe phytoplankton diversity patterns and applied a machine-learning algorithm to test the degree to which species richness patterns are potentially controlled by environmental factors. Selected environmental factors were studied at two scales: the lake-scale (e.g. nutrients concentrations, water temperature, lake depth) and the catchment-scale (e.g. catchment, landscape and climate variables). Then, we used a variance partitioning approach to evaluate the interaction between lake-scale and catchment-scale variables in explaining local species richness. Finally, we analysed the residuals of predictive models to identify potential vectors of improvement of phytoplankton species richness predictive models. Lake-scale and catchment-scale drivers provided similar predictive accuracy of local species richness (R2 = 0.458 and 0.424, respectively). Both models suggested that seasonal temperature variations and nutrient supply strongly modulate local species richness. Integrating lake- and catchment-scale predictors in a single predictive model did not provide increased predictive accuracy; therefore suggesting that the catchment-scale model probably explains observed species richness variations through the impact of catchment-scale variables on in-lake water quality characteristics. Models based on catchment characteristics, which include simple and easy to obtain variables, provide a meaningful way of predicting phytoplankton species richness in temperate lakes.

Methods: The association between meteorological variables and HFMD cases in Huainan, China, from January 1st 2012 to December 31st 2014 was analysed using Poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) after controlling for long-term trend and seasonality, mean temperature and relative humidity. Results: An adverse effect of TCN on childhood HFMD was observed, and the impact of TCN was the greatest at five days lag, with a 10% (95% CI: 4%-15%) increase of daily number of HFMD cases per 3 C (10th percentile) decrease of TCN. Male children, children aged 0-5 years, scattered children and children in high-risk areas appeared to be more vulnerable to the TCN effect than others. However, there was no significant association between DTR and childhood HFMD. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TCN drops may increase the incidence of childhood HFMD in Huainan, highlighting the importance of protecting children from forthcoming TCN drops, particularly for those who are male, young, scattered and from high-risk areas.  2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a stage-structured population model that realistically captures the temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years. As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g. changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g. reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes). As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow relative to the developmental period of the organism (003-005{ring operator}C per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 01{ring operator}C per year). The Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short time-scales and under slow warming regimes.  2013 The Authors.

This was accomplished by finding out a correlation between the applied orthodontic force and thermal variations in the tooth structure. To this end, geometry of the human tooth surrounded by the connective soft tissue called the periodontal ligament and the bone was constructed by employing dental CT scan images of a specific case. The periodontal ligament was modeled by finite strain viscoelastic model through a nonlinear stress-strain relation (hyperelasticity) and nonlinear stress-time relation (viscoelasticity). The tooth structure was loaded by a lateral force with 15 different quantities applied to 20 different locations, along the midedge of the tooth crown. The resultant compressive stress in the periodontal ligament was considered as the cause of elevated cell activity that was modeled by a transient heat flux in the thermal analysis. The heat flux value was estimated by conducting an experiment on a pair of rats. The numerical results showed that by applying an orthodontic force to the tooth structure, a significant temperature rise was observed. By measuring the temperature rise, the orthodontic process can be evaluated. Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Scopus","1","e2899","excluded",""

Furthermore, the assessment of dynamic temperature variations in the cell culture area is challenging with the methods traditionally used for measuring temperature in cell culture systems. To overcome these challenges, we integrated a microscale cell culture environment together with live-cell imaging and a precise local temperature control that is based on an indirect measurement. The control method uses a remote temperature measurement and a mathematical model for estimating temperature at the desired area. The system maintained the temperature at 370.3 C for more than 4 days. We also showed that the system precisely controls the culture temperature during temperature transients and compensates for the disturbance when changing the cell cultivation medium, and presented the portability of the heating system.

The ROC can be calibrated to null the parasitic effects of transducer variation due to physical assembly. A prototype is fabricated in a 130 nm RFCMOS process, with an active area of 22179m2 and 1.84  W power consumption at VDD=1.2V and 1ms read-out rate. The ROC output is robust to VDD and temperature variations in a range | VDD| 20% and (25-53) C. Furthermore, it can provide up to 200m Vpp power supply sine wave rejection in the range 50Hz-5MHz at VDD=1.1V , for an output standard deviation lower than one LSB. Owing to its features and its digital modularity, the ROC was co-designed with a scalable and modular Multi-Walled Carbon NanoTube (MW-CNT) Nano composite transducer, to achieve tunable output sensitivity by adjusting the sensor nominal capacitance and the reference capacitance. The maximum sensitivity of 5.23 fF per LSB was reached when both match. The ROC was then validated with the MW-CNT nanocomposite sensor which exhibits a piecewise behaviour. 5.3 and 7.1 ENOB were extrapolated in the low-load and medium-load regions, respectively. Besides the major advantage of tunable sensitivity, the presented ROC features the lowest acquisition time and one of the most compact sizes among the state-of-the-art ROCs.

Thus, how temperature affects these life stages should be considered for broadly understanding the ecological consequences of climate warming on such species. For example, temperature variation during particular life stages may affect respective change in body size, phenology and geographic range, which have been identified as the ""universal"" ecological responses to climate change. While each of these responses has been separately documented across a number of species, it is not known whether each response occurs together within a species. The influence of temperature during particular life stages may help explain each of these ecological responses to climate change. Our goal was to determine if monthly temperature variation during particular life stages of a butterfly species can predict respective changes in body size and phenology. We also refer to the literature to assess if temperature variability during the adult stage influences range change over time. Using historical museum collections paired with monthly temperature records, we show that changes in body size and phenology of the univoltine butterfly, Hesperia comma, are partly dependent upon temporal variation in summer temperatures during key stages of their life cycle. June temperatures, which are likely to affect growth rate of the final larval instar, are important for predicting adult body size (for males only; showing a positive relationship with temperature). July temperatures, which are likely to influence the pupal stage, are important for predicting the timing of adult emergence (showing a negative relationship with temperature). Previous studies show that August temperatures, which act on the adult stage, are linked to range change. Our study highlights the importance of considering temperature variation during each life stage over historic time-scales for understanding intraspecific response to climate change. Range edge studies of ectothermic species that have annual life cycles, long time-series occurrence data, and associated temperature records (ideally at monthly resolutions) could be useful model systems for intraspecific tests of the universal ecological responses to climate change and for exploring interactive effects.  2016 British Ecological Society.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

The potential threat represented by these changes for marine species could be amplified in coastal areas, characterized by higher levels of pollutants. In addition, temperate organisms may exhibit a different seasonal tolerance to stressors influenced by fluctuations of environmental and physiological factors. In this study, Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis collected both in summer and winter were exposed to combinations of two temperatures (SST, seasonal surface temperature and SST+5 C) and two levels of pH (8.20 and 7.40) in clean or cadmium contaminated seawater (20 g/L Cd). mRNA levels of genes related to metal-induced stress response were investigated, including metallothionein mt-20, heat-shock protein hsp70, superoxide dismutase Cu/Zn-sod, catalase cat, glutathione peroxidase gpx1 and glutathione S-transferase gst-pi. To further elucidate if tissues with different physiological roles could exhibit different responsiveness, such analyses were carried out in digestive gland and in gills of exposed mussels. mt-20 mRNA increase after Cd-exposure was higher in the digestive gland than in the gills, with few modulations by temperature or pH only in the latter. Acidification, alone or in combination with other stressors, increased hsp70 mRNA, with seasonal- and tissue-specificities (higher in summer and in digestive gland). Among antioxidants, gpx1 mRNA was affected by Cd in both tissues and seasons, with further modulations due to pH and temperature variation tissue- and season-specific; in winter the combination of Cd, warming and acidification affected Cu/Zn-sod both in digestive gland and gills and cat only in gills, while weak seasonal variations were observed for gst-pi transcripts only in digestive gland.

However, vegetation-induced changes in water resources through changing land surface energy balance (e.g. albedo), has not been well documented. This study investigates the underlying causes of vegetation change and subsequent impacts on runoff for the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau. Results show that satellite-derived vegetation index has experienced a significantly increasing trend during the past three decades, especially during 20002012. Large-scale ecological restorations, i.e., the Natural Forest Conservation project and the Grain for Green project, are found to be the primary driving factors for vegetation increase. The increased vegetation coverage induces decrease in surface albedo and results in an increase in temperature. This positive effect can be counteracted by higher evapotranspiration and the net effect is a decrease in daytime land surface temperature. A higher evapotranspiration rate from restored vegetation is the primary reason for the reduced runoff coefficient. Other factors including less heavy precipitation, increased water consumption from town, industry and agriculture also appear to be the important causes for the reduction of runoff. These two ecological restoration projects produce both positive and negative effects on the overall ecosystem services. Thus, long-term continuous monitoring is needed.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

Several studies have documented that the organic horizon thickness has profound buffering effects on soil temperature for both tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. In the present study, the alpine meadow ecosystem in the middle and low-latitude permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) was selected to examine the impacts of surface soil organic matter on the thermal properties of deep soil. Based on the data obtained from more than 23 observation sites, the relationship between soil organic content and soil temperature dynamics in different seasons was determined. The findings indicate a strong positive exponential (in thawing period) and linear (in freezing period) relationship between surface soil organic content (SOC) and soil temperature dynamics in deep soil layers. The higher SOC at the surface soil layer is associated with a lower rate of soil temperature variation and a later onset time for the thaw-freeze transformation. In permafrost regions of the QTP, the greater lapse rate of soil temperature per 100. m of increased elevation resulted in more significant modification of the SOC and soil thermal relationship in alpine meadows than that in tundra and boreal ecosystems.

Such information could be gathered from infrared measurements as they are non-invasive and can be carried out without the direct involvement of the weightlifter. The purpose of the study was to analyse temperature changes in the shoulder girdle in the first phase of the snatch in weightlifting. Methods The study involved 11 weightlifters who competed in two weight categories, 94 and 105 kg, during the World University Championships in 2018. The performance of the snatch was recorded using a thermographic camera in three consecutive attempts. We analysed the temperature changes in the left and right shoulder girdles in the two initial stages of the snatch.

Results Statistically significant temperature increases were found from the moment of gripping the barbell to the moment it was pulled. These effects were different in individual weightlifters but did not depend on the attempt or the side of the body. Conclusions Temperature increases in the initial phase of the snatch are most likely the result of activating successive motor units in order to perform the effort needed to pull the barbell and cause it to accelerate.

Pre-and post-exercise skin temperature did not differ significantly, however, the increase rates of temperature and the root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signals grew significantly. In most of the players, skin temperature also correlated with the RMS, median frequency (MDF), and mean frequency (MF) of the EMG signals. Conclusions: Measuring the time of maintaining submaximal torque during isometric contraction and the slope coefficient for the increase in temperature recorded using a thermographic camera can be a simple, cost-effective, and non-invasive method of assessing fatigue and efficiency decreases in the muscles in volleyball players.  2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

To consider the combined effect of both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species population responses to inter-and intra-annual temperature changes. This framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions: Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain), and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing current and future (mid-21st century) climatic conditions under two emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in population size. High variability in population size was observed between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40 during the next 50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose a modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and agricultural ecosystems.  2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

Abstract: The use of 15N tracer is a powerful tool for tracking the effects of variation in soil frost on plant nitrogen acquisition. While the responses of juvenile trees to environmental change are often used to infer the responses of canopy trees, the 15N enrichment responses of juveniles and mature canopy trees may not be comparable. We conducted a winter soil temperature manipulation study (snow exclusion, ambient snow or soil insulation) in a lowland Fagus sylvatica forest. 15N tracer was applied the following spring and the 15N enrichments of soil, juvenile and mature canopy trees were examined in late fall. Within canopy trees and juveniles, the relative treatment effects on 15N enrichment were consistent among all sampled tissues (roots, stem cores, leaves, buds and the current years shoot growth). For juveniles, 15N enrichment was highest under snow exclusion (coldest soil) and lowest under soil insulation (warmest soil), and lower 15N enrichment occurred under ambient conditions than under snow exclusion. For canopy trees, 15N enrichment also was highest under snow exclusion and lowest under soil insulation, but there was no difference in 15N enrichment between ambient conditions and the snow exclusion treatment. Therefore, our results indicate that sampling of juveniles may overestimate the nitrogen acquisition responses of mature trees to winter temperature variation.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"excluded",""

Using a food web module of two consumers competing for a biotic resource, we investigate how temperature effects on species attack and mortality rates scale up to population-level outcomes of coexistence and exclusion. We find that differences between species in their competitive effects ultimately arise from asymmetries generated by the nonlinear nature of the temperature response of mortality: cold-adapted species and thermal specialists limit themselves more strongly than they limit their warm-adapted and generalist competitors. These asymmetries become greater as seasonal temperature fluctuations increase, generating latitudinal variation in coexistence patterns and priority effects. Characterizing species thermal niches in terms of mechanistic descriptions of trait responses to temperature allows us to make testable predictions about the population-level outcomes of competition based solely on three fundamentaland easily measurablequantities: attack rate optima, response breadths, and temperature sensitivity of mortality. We validate our framework by testing its predictions with data from an insect host-parasitoid community. Simply by quantifying the three basic quantities, we predict that priority effects cannot occur in this system, which is borne out by population-level experiments showing that the outcome of competition does not depend on initial conditions. More broadly, our framework can predict the conditions under which exotic invasive species can exclude or coexist with native biota as well as the effects of climate warming on competitive communities across latitudinal gradients.  2018 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

At least 72 perennial lakes are scattered throughout the desert, sustaining a unique desert-lake ecosystem. Groundwater of various origins was believed to play an essential role in maintaining those desert lakes, but hydrological measurements are lacking due to difficult field conditions. This study applied the distributed temperature sensing technique to continuously measure temperature variations in one of the desert lakes - the Badain Lake - to identify groundwater discharge to the lake based on the temperature differences between groundwater and lake water. Because temperature may be influenced by various unforeseen and temporary factors, it is critical to discern those factors that may affect the temperature such as solar radiation and vertical temperature stratification and to ensure that the temperature variations of the lake water as detected by the distributed temperature sensing are mainly caused by groundwater discharge. A time window was identified during which the groundwater discharge is the dominant factor that determines the temperature pattern of the lake water. The results show that the temperature near the eastern and southeastern lakeshore of the eastern Badain Lake is colder than the average, indicating that this area is the main groundwater discharge zone. Near the northwestern lakeshore adjacent to a sand dune, a weak cold abnormal area was identified, indicating that the sand dune is another recharge source to the lake through channelling the local precipitation toward the lake. The contribution from the sand dune, however, appeared to be less than that from the regional groundwater flow. This study provides the first identification of the temperature abnormal areas, which imply groundwater discharges into desert lakes and contributes to a better understanding of the unique desert-lake ecosystem.  2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Scopus","9",NA,"excluded",""

The proposed individual-based model (IBM) allows each life-stage, or group of stages, to be represented and considers the differences in development rates and mortality caused by temperature and predation. The biological functions of the model were selected and calibrated to ensure realistic development at the temperatures recorded in the Seine estuary. The effect of temperature on development time and clutch size (CS) were obtained indirectly by fitting equations to the durations of stages observed in the laboratory at various temperatures and to CSs observed in the field. The degree-day approach was used to consider temperature variations. Mortality from predation was parameterized using the observed abundance of key predators. The proposed model successfully reproduces the life-history timing of the E. affinis population observed in the Seine estuary. The IBM approach was also used to simulate the development of the E. affinis population over several years at various temperatures with unlimited food conditions and no density dependence. The results confirm that the proposed model captures the role of temperature and predation in driving the seasonal population dynamics of E. affinis in the Seine estuary. This tool could be applied to any other egg-bearing copepods or could be used to test various E. affinis development scenarios in estuaries.

A striking difference between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer to the temperature at which fitness is maximized (T opt) and an upper temperature limit for survival (T max) that is closer to T opt than do temperate species. Thus, even a small increase in environmental temperature could put tropical ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework to partition the temperature response of fitness into its components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness declines at high temperatures because the temperature responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways: fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase. The proximity of T opt to T max depends on how the temperature response of development mediates the interaction between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which causes fitness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures exceed T opt. The model correctly predicts empirically observed fitness-temperature relationships in insects from different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the latitudinal differences in fitness responses.  2011 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Scopus","2",NA,"selected",""

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 138C and 308C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 178 of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 88C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","9",NA,"selected",""

There was a positive relationship between the historical frequency of SST anomalies and recent thermal stress; sites historically dominated by the high-frequency mode experienced greater thermal stress than other sites during both events, and showed extensive coral bleaching in 1998. Nonetheless, in 2005-2006, corals at sites dominated by high-frequency variability showed reduced bleaching, despite experiencing high thermal stress.

Theoretical models postulate that thermal specialization should be favored either when little environmental variation is experienced within generations or when among-generation variation is small relative to within-generation variation. To test these predictions, we studied six temperate species of damselflies differing in latitudinal distribution. We developed a computer model simulating how organisms experience environmental variation (accounting for diapause and voltinism) and performed a laboratory experiment assaying thermal sensitivities of growth rates. The computer model showed opposing latitudinal trends in among- and within-generation thermal variability: Within-generation thermal variability decreased toward higher latitudes, whereas relative levels of among-generation thermal variability peaked at midlatitudes (where a shift in voltinism occurred). The growth experiment showed that low-latitude species were more thermally generalized than mid- and high-latitude species, supporting the prediction that generalists are favored under high levels of within-generation variation. Northern species had steeper, nearexponential reaction norms suggestive of thermal specialization. However, they had strikingly high thermal optima and grew very slowly over most of the thermal range they are expected to experience in the field. This observation is at present difficult to explain.

Previous work on this topic has yielded conflicting outcomes with some studies predicting that warming should increase consumer-resource oscillations and others predicting that warming should decrease consumer-resource oscillations. Here, I develop a consumer-resource model that both synthesizes previous findings in a common framework and yields novel insights about temperature effects on consumer-resource dynamics. I report three key findings. First, when the resource species' birth rate exhibits a unimodal temperature response, as demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies, the temperature range over which the consumer-resource interaction can persist is determined by the lower and upper temperature limits to the resource species' reproduction. This contrasts with the predictions of previous studies, which assume that the birth rate exhibits a monotonic temperature response, that consumer extinction is determined by temperature effects on consumer species' traits, rather than the resource species' traits. Secondly, the comparative analysis I have conducted shows that whether warming leads to an increase or decrease in consumer-resource oscillations depends on the manner in which temperature affects intraspecific competition. When the strength of self-limitation increases monotonically with temperature, warming causes a decrease in consumer-resource oscillations. However, if self-limitation is strongest at temperatures physiologically optimal for reproduction, a scenario previously unanalysed by theory but amply substantiated by empirical data, warming can cause an increase in consumer-resource oscillations. Thirdly, the model yields testable comparative predictions about consumer-resource dynamics under alternative hypotheses for how temperature affects competitive and resource acquisition traits. Importantly, it does so through empirically quantifiable metrics for predicting temperature effects on consumer viability and consumer-resource oscillations, which obviates the need for parameterizing complex dynamical models. Tests of these metrics with empirical data on a host-parasitoid interaction yield realistic estimates of temperature limits for consumer persistence and the propensity for consumer-resource oscillations, highlighting their utility in predicting temperature effects, particularly warming, on consumer-resource interactions in both natural and agricultural settings.  2014 British Ecological Society.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

To this aim, the probability distribution of Anet was obtained by combining a probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in Tl with data on Anet responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and 111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a) expected increases in Tl variability will decrease mean Anet and increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean Tl depend on species and initial Tl, and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of leaf warming, maintaining Anet at &gt;80% of its maximum under most thermal regimes.  2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus","6",NA,"selected",""

Here we develop a theoretical framework for elucidating temperature effects on competition that integrates mechanistic descriptions of life-history trait responses to temperature with population models that realistically capture the variable developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. This framework yields testable comparative predictions about how intraspecific competition affects reproduction, development, and mortality under alternative hypotheses about the temperature dependence of competition. The key finding is that ectotherm population regulation in seasonal environments depends crucially on the mechanisms by which temperature affects competition. When competition is strongest at temperatures optimal for reproduction, effects of temperature and competition act antagonistically, leading to more complex dynamics than when competition is temperature independent. When the strength of competition increases with temperature past the optimal temperature for reproduction, effects of temperature and competition act synergistically, leading to dynamics qualitatively similar to those when competition is temperature independent. Paradoxically, antagonistic effects yield a higher population floor despite greater fluctuations. These findings have important implications for predicting effects of climate warming on population regulation. Synergistic effects of temperature and competition can predispose populations to stochastic extinction by lowering minimum population sizes, while antagonistic effects can increase the potential for population outbreaks through greater fluctuations in abundance.  2014 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

Infrared thermography is a possible non-invasive alternative, but the cost of standard thermal cameras, lack of dedicated software for biomedical purposes, and labour-intensiveness of thermal image analysis have limited their use. An additional limitation lies on the scarcity of research on the causing factors of differences between body surface and core body temperature. We propose a method for automatic assessment of mean body surface temperature in freely-moving mice, using dedicated software for thermal image analysis. While skin surface temperature may not necessarily be linearly correlated with core body temperature (in itself an imprecise concept), under standardized environmental conditions, such as those in which laboratory animals are kept, mean body surface temperature can provide useful information on their thermal status (i.e. deviations from normothermia, namely hypo- and hyperthermia). We developed a publicly available software that includes an imaging analysis workflow/algorithm for automatic segmentation of the pixels associated with the animal from the pixels associated with the background, removing the need for manually defining the area of analysis. A batch analysis mode is also available, for automatic and high-throughput analysis of all image files located in a folder. The software is compatible with the most widespread thermal camera manufacturer, FLIR Systems, as well as with the low-cost Thermal Expert TE-Q1 miniaturized high-resolution thermal camera used for this study. Furthermore, the software has been validated in a mouse model expressing non-transient hypothermia, where the thermal analysis results were compared with readings from implanted thermo-sensitive passive integrated transponders tags. Thermography allows for thermal assessment of laboratory animals without the effect of handling stress on their physiology or behaviour. Our automatic image analysis software also removes observer errors and bias, while speeding up the data processing.  2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

The role of water temperature as a driver of various intra-ecosystem processes is particularly significant in glacierized basins due to the strong coupling and high sensitivity between atmospheric and in-stream processes. In this paper, we review studies of the temperature characteristics in glacier-fed river streams, the influencing factors, and the response in aquatic ecosystems. Previous analyses have shown that glacial rivers are characterized by low temperatures and remarkable spatiotemporal temperature variations. Influencing factors in glacial rivers can be summarized in four major categories: heat transfer at the air-water interface, heat transfer at the water-channel interface, runoff components, and climate change and human activity. The response of a glacial river thermal regime to its physicochemical properties results in changes to the river water quality and thermo-hydrological fluxes. While the response of the aquatic ecosystem changes the distribution and structure of aquatic system with changing glacial stream temperature, once a certain threshold is exceeded, the change will be irreversible.  2015, Science Press.

In the present study we aimed to evaluate gas exchange and pulmonary breathing pattern in L. paradoxa at different temperatures (25 and 30C) and different inspired O2 levels (21, 12, 10, and 7%). Normoxic breathing pattern consisted of isolated ventilatory cycles composed of an expiration followed by 2.40.2 buccal inspirations. Both expiratory and inspiratory tidal volumes reached a maximum of about 35mlkg1, indicating that L. paradoxa is able to exchange nearly all of its lung air in a single ventilatory cycle. At both temperatures, hypoxia caused a significant increase in pulmonary ventilation (VE), mainly due to an increase in respiratory frequency. Durations of the ventilatory cycle and expiratory and inspiratory tidal volumes were not significantly affected by hypoxia. Expiratory time (but not inspiratory) was significantly shorter at 30C and at all O2 levels. While a small change in oxygen consumption (VO2) could be noticed, the carbon dioxide release (VCO2, P=0.0003) and air convection requirement (VE/VO2, P=0.0001) were significantly affected by hypoxia (7% O2) at both temperatures, when compared to normoxia, and pulmonary diffusion capacity increased about four-fold due to hypoxic exposure.

A thermal model is proposed that predicts the thermal responses of the skin and object surface as well as the heat flux exchanged during hand-object interactions. The model was evaluated by comparing the theoretical predictions of temperature changes to those experimentally measured using an infrared thermal measurement system. The thermal measurement system was designed to overcome the limitations imposed by contact thermal sensors, and was able to measure skin temperature during contact, together with the contact area and contact force. The experimental results indicated that over the pressure range of 0.73-10.98 kPa, changes in skin temperature were well localized to the contact area and were affected by contact pressure. The pressure in turn influenced both thermal contact resistance and blood flow. Over the range of contact forces typically used in manual exploration, blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation do not appear to have a significant effect on the skin's thermal responses. The theoretical predictions and the measured data were consistent in characterizing the time course and amplitude of the skin temperature change during contact with differences typically being less than 1C between the two for pressures greater than 4 kPa. These findings indicate that the proposed thermal model is able to characterize and predict the skin temperature responses during hand-object interactions and could be used in a thermal display that simulates the properties of different materials.

However, few experiments have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six populations that spanned the species geographic range in the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have differentiated across the species range. There was some evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly variable responses to transplantation across the species range, and only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate change that have not been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing angiosperms.  2016 Botanical Society of America.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

Many pesticides are indeed more toxic at higher mean temperatures. Yet, we know next to nothing about the effect of another key component of climate change, the increase of daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), on pesticide toxicity. Therefore, we tested the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under different levels of DTF (constant = 0 C, low = 5 C (current maximum level) and high = 10 C (predicted maximum level under global warming)) around the same mean temperature on key life history and physiological traits of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae in a common-garden experiment. At all levels of DTF, chlorpyrifos exposure was stressful: it reduced energy storage (fat content) and the activity of its target enzyme acetylcholinesterase, while it increased the activity of the detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Notably, chlorpyrifos did not cause mortality or reduced growth rate at the constant temperature (0 C DTF), yet increased mortality 6x and reduced growth rate with ca. 115% in the presence of DTF. This indicates that daily short-term exposures to higher temperatures can increase pesticide toxicity. Our data suggest that when 5 C DTF will become more common in the studied high-latitude populations, this will increase the toxicity of CPF, and that a further increase from 5 DTF to 10 C DTF may not result in a further increase of pesticide toxicity. Our results highlight the biological importance of including daily temperature fluctuations in ecological risk assessment of pesticides and as an extra dimension in the climate-induced toxicant sensitivity concept.

A challenge when conducting such assessments is the integration of the multi-level properties and processes of ecosystems into an assessment framework. Focusing on the primary stresses of climate thermal variability (at both upper and lower extremes), this study proposes a quantitative indicator system - following the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment - that assesses the impact of historical climate change, during 1901-2013, on the natural terrestrial vegetation types in China. The final output of the vulnerability assessment was expressed as a composite index, composed of ecosystem exposure, sensitivity and resilience to climate thermal change, and including biological, ecological and spatial traits of vegetation types in the assessment. The exposure to temperature variability was generally higher in January than in July, and higher in non-arborous vegetation types than forests. In contrast, sensitivity was higher for forests, wetlands and alpine tundra regions, especially for small areas and areas with scattered patterns. Original forests - especially those distributed in the north - had lower resilience than other vegetation types. The vulnerability of natural vegetation types in China to the temperature variability of the past century was very low to moderate, with a few exceptions, including tropical mangroves and the semi-arid to arid vegetation types in northwestern China, which had high vulnerability. Vulnerability was stronger in winter than in summer. Our results are generally in accord with the scenario-based projections on the geographical pattern of vegetation vulnerability to climate change, and revealed the difference caused by not considering moisture. The risks for these fragmented and narrow-range ecosystems are highlighted, and the importance of natural resilience is stressed for the assessment of vegetation vulnerability to climate change. Given the inadequate coverage of the natural reserve network in China (after the large investment in recent decades) found in the high-vulnerability vegetation types (with a few exceptions), the assessment of natural resilience of ecosystems could be critical for the optimal design of socio-economic strategies in response to the impacts of future climate change.  2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing suitable charging patterns, while taking into account of various contradictory objectives and constraints is a key but challenging topic in battery management. This paper develops a model based strategy that optimizes the charging patterns while considers various key parameters such as the charging speed, energy conversion efficiency as well as temperature variations. To achieve this, a battery model coupling both the electric and thermal characteristics is first introduced. Three key but conflicting objectives, including the charging time, energy loss and temperature rise especially for internal temperature, are formulated. Then, multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (M-BBO) approaches are employed to search the optimal charging patterns and to balance various objectives with different combinations. Optimization results of four M-BBO approaches are compared, and the Pareto fronts for battery charging with various dual-objectives and triple-objectives are analysed in detail. Experimental results confirm that the developed strategy can offer feasible charging patterns and achieve a desirable trade-off among charging speed, energy conversion efficiency and temperature variations. The Pareto fronts obtained by this strategy can be adopted as references to adjust charging pattern to further satisfy various requirements in different charging applications.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

Nest fate also varies across spatially heterogeneous habitat, and changing land uses may independently introduce stressors on reproductive outcome. Identifying the individual and synergistic effects of climate change and land-use change is necessary for understanding the impact of global change on native species. We studied the nest fate of 3 sympatric species breeding in urban habitat in an arid region of the western United States. We monitored nests (n = 371) of American Robin (Turdus migratorius), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), and Black-headed Grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus) over 4 yr on an urban-to-rural gradient and analyzed nest fate in relation to temperatures at the time of egg laying and after eggs hatched. Habitat measurements included nest height and the amounts of canopy cover and impervious surfaces at 3 spatial scales of 20-m, 100-m, and 500-m radii from the nest. Our data most strongly supported models that included temperature deviation after hatching, nest stage, fine-scale canopy cover, and pedestrian traffic. Nest survival increased at slight temperature increases during the nestling stage, which suggests that in a climate-change context, moderate warming in spring temperatures may be beneficial for some breeding birds. Nests were more likely to survive at locations with more canopy cover in a 20-m radius and at sites with more pedestrian traffic, which suggests that increasing cover of native riparian tree canopy at fine scales may enhance habitat quality in multiuse urban reserves. Our results demonstrate that effects of climate change on avian populations must be considered synergistically with land-use and land-cover characteristics of the urban landscape, including tree canopy cover and level of human disturbance.  2015 American Ornithologists' Union.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

However, effective human-computer interaction would require machines to distinguish between the subtle facial expressions of affective states. This work, for the first time, attempts to use the transient facial thermal features for recognizing a much wider range of facial expressions. A database of 324 time-sequential, visible-spectrum, and thermal facial images was developed representing different facial expressions from 23 participants in different situations. A novel facial thermal feature extraction, selection, and classification approach was developed and invoked on various Gaussian mixture models constructed using: neutral and pretended happy and sad faces, faces with multiple positive and negative facial expressions, faces with neutral and six (pretended) basic facial expressions, and faces with evoked happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger. This work demonstrates that (1) infrared imaging can be used to observe the affective-state-specific facial thermal variations, (2) pixel-grey level analysis of TIRIs can help localise significant facial thermal feature points along the major facial muscles, and (3) cluster-analytic classification of transient thermal features can help distinguish between the facial expressions of affective states in an optimized eigenspace of input thermal feature vectors.

Abstract: Woody evergreen plants inhabiting cold desert ecosystems must retain their foliage amidst chronically dry conditions and large seasonal temperature variations. To understand the strategies enabling survival of evergreens in these environments, we monitored seasonal changes in foliar gas exchange and photosynthetic traits of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen broadleaved shrub native to the cold desert of northwestern China. We found that photosynthesis was relatively higher in spring and summer and lower in fall and winter. Transitioning from spring to summer, A. mongolicus maintained high photosynthetic capacity (Amax). Transitioning into fall, the Amaxand maximum stomatal conductance (gsmax) decreased, while the relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (Ls) increased. In winter, A. mongolicus decreased Amax, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), maximum RuBisCo carboxylation rates (Vcmax), maximum RuBP regeneration rates (Jmax), and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) relative to other seasons. Collectively, these results suggest that A. mongolicus adapts physiologically to maximize carbon assimilation during spring and summer, and to maximize foliar resistance to cold stress at the expense of photosynthesis in winter. Foliage was protected against photo-oxidative damage during temperature extremes in winter by dark-sustained thermal energy dissipation. Overall, our study reveals that multiple photosynthetic adjustments, varying among the seasons, enable the survival of cold desert evergreens.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus","2",NA,"excluded",""

With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes.

Understanding how fish growth responds to changing environments is essential for indicating and predicting the impacts of climate change on fish populations, communities, and even aquatic ecosystems, but the knowledge on this topic remains incomplete, and some findings are contradictory. This study aimed to review the status of current research by analysing data on the environment, species, and response patterns from 1187 documents published from 1976 to 2018, which helped to identify key questions that are currently neglected and potential reasons for these divergences. The results found that 75% of studies were conducted in the field (mostly in temperate and subtropical zones), while the remainder were controlled experiments. Fishes from freshwater ecosystems were relatively less studied than their marine counterparts. Less than 1% of the recorded fish species (309 vs. approximately 35,000) from 30 orders have been studied to examine their growth responses to climate change. All studied fishes were from Actinopterygii. The top three orders were Perciformes, Cypriniformes, and Salmoniformes by species number, while Salmoniformes was the most frequently studied order. The most common habitat type of the studied fish was pelagic, followed by demersal and reef-associated habitats. Small fishes were relatively undervalued in both marine and freshwater systems. The mean trophic levels of the studied species were 3.2 for freshwater fish and 3.4 for marine fish. Carnivores were the dominant trophic guild studied in both marine and freshwater systems. The overall effects of climate change (primarily temperature variables) on fish growth (reflected in physiology and health) were negative at both the global and local scales. Therefore, the results suggested that future studies covering more species (e.g., chondrichthyan fishes, low-level consumers, and small fishes) and areas (e.g., high-latitude areas) are required to obtain a better understanding of climate change impacts on fish growth.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Scopus",NA,"106976","selected",""

Six aquaculture site configurations were studied. These consisted of high and low flow locations, off-bottom and long-line farming techniques and different benthic/substrate types. At each site, a number of growth and health variables were monitored monthly between January 2012 and March 2013 on 30 randomly selected thalli. Variables included thallus-level growth, intensity of epiphyte and disease infection, intensity of fish and sea urchin grazing and cover of pest seaweed and sediment. The following key environmental variables were also monitored at the site level: water temperature, irradiance, salinity, water depth, wave action, pH and oxygen content. Overall average relative growth rate of K. alvarezii in the region was 4.5  0.06% day1 and varied by site and season. Generally, growth rate was higher during the winter season (AprilAugust, 5.04  0.31% day1) than in the summer (3.90  0.28% day1). The long-line farming technique provided higher growth (5.46  0.09% day1) than the off-bottom technique (3.99  0.07% day1). Thallus-level analysis showed that fish grazing, epiphyte cover, sediment cover and disease had significant negative correlations with growth, and the four variables were positively correlated. Site-level analysis on the effects of physico-chemical and health factors showed that sedimentation, daily maximum of water temperature and variability, and interactions between these factors were the main determinants of growth. Growth was lower at high sedimentation levels and higher values of maximum temperature and temperature variation.

Our study investigated the effect of different constant and fluctuating temperatures on the body mass and development time of red flour beetles (. Tribolium castaneum Herbst, 1797); we also examined whether the sexes differed in their responses to thermal conditions.We exposed the progeny of half-sib families of a T. castaneum laboratory strain to one of four temperature regimes: constant 30. C, constant 25. C, fluctuating with a daily mean of 30. C, or fluctuating with a daily mean of 25. C. Sex-specific development time and body mass at emergence were determined.Beetles developed the fastest and had the greatest body mass upon emergence when they were exposed to a constant temperature of 30. C. This pattern was reversed when beetles experienced a constant temperature of 25. C: slowest development and lowest body mass upon emergence were observed. Fluctuations changed those effects significantly - impact of temperature on development time was smaller, while differences in body mass disappeared completely. Our results do not fit TSR predictions. Furthermore, regardless of the temperature regime, females acquired more mass, while there were no differences between sexes in development time to eclosion. This finding fails to support one of the explanations for smaller male size: that selection favors the early emergence of males.

A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems.  2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Scopus","2",NA,"selected",""

Many studies have, therefore, investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling, foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than active, and understanding the determinants of this resting time may provide new insights into the habitat-specific time-budgeting problems that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend resting, using data from a wide range of ecologically different species. However, total resting time consists of two components: enforced resting time (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free resting time (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced resting time is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this relationship show that enforced resting time distinguishes between locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show that an annual temperature increase of 2-4 C would greatly increase enforced resting time, leading to serious time-budgeting problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced resting time on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong for folivorous primates. This study shows that resting time is an important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa.  2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Article","Scopus","2",NA,"excluded",""

In a BBN, the important variables in a problem are identified and causal relationships are represented graphically. Underpinning this is the probabilistic framework in which variables can take on a finite range of mutually exclusive states. Associated with each variable is a conditional probability table (CPT), showing the probability of a variable attaining each of its possible states conditioned on all possible combinations of it parents. Whilst the variables (nodes) are connected, the CPT attached to each node can be quantified independently. This allows each variable to be populated with the best data available, including expert opinion, simulation results or observed data. It also allows the information to be easily updated as better data become available This paper reports on the process of developing a BBN to better understand the initial rapid growth phase (initiation) of a marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya majuscula, in Moreton Bay, Queensland. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Lyngbya blooms in this region have increased in severity and extent over the past decade. Lyngbya has been associated with acute dermatitis and a range of other health problems in humans. Blooms have been linked to ecosystem degradation and have also damaged commercial and recreational fisheries. However, the causes of blooms are as yet poorly understood. The initial phase of model development consisted of a series of workshops and individual meetings with participants, in which important hydrologic, nutrient, light and temperature variables were identified and their causal relationships defined. This systematic approach allowed for the construction of a conceptual model describing factors and their interactions that contribute to the initiation of Lyngbya. This early model was subsequently refined, balancing model complexity against research costs. The CPT were then populated by the group based on their scientific knowledge. In some cases this was via a process, simulation, mathematical or statistical model; in others it was via expert opinion and round-table agreement. The software package Netica was used to construct the model. Note that further refinements to the model are expected. There have been a number of important outcomes from the process of building the preliminary BBN. The interchange among scientists and other stakeholders during workshops led to: a greater understanding of important variables and their interaction by building on the experience of the group, in turn leading to a greater maturity in reasoning about the problem during successive iterations of the model; a greater awareness of the role of individual scientists' research in the larger picture; and a recognition of the need to coordinate data and models arising from the different research projects. Significant outcomes are that the BBN has provided a framework to prioritise and integrate the ongoing research contributions and to quantify the data needs. At this stage, a range of longer term goals have been identified. The model will be further refined as new research or better information becomes available, and serve as a focus for the coordination of data and models arising from the various research projects on Lyngbya . This BBN will also be used to contribute both to the design of monitoring programmes for Lyngbya in Moreton Bay, and the analysis of data from these and other programmes. The model should be validated by applying the Bayesian network to other locations in order to identify local and global characteristics and assess the robustness of both the conceptual model and the network inputs. Importantly, it is planned to develop a similar conceptual model and BBN for the management aspects of Lyngbya, and integrate this into the scientific model with the aim of identifying possible management strategies, predicting their potential impact and developing scenarios relevant to future planning.","Conference Paper","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

One overlooked, yet insightful, mechanism are bioenergetic responses as these provide information about the balance between energy gains and costs. Therefore, we studied how the bioenergetic responses to the insecticide chlorpyrifos were affected by a higher mean temperature and a higher DTF in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae. To quantify bioenergetic responses we measured energy availability (Ea), energy consumption (Ec) and total net energy budget (cellular energy allocation, CEA). Exposure to chlorpyrifos considerably reduced CEA values when a high mean temperature was combined with a high DTF (up to 18%). Notably, chlorpyrifos had little effect on CEA at a constant 20 C, meaning that the bioenergetic impact of chlorpyrifos would have been underestimated if we had only tested under standard testing conditions. The chlorpyrifos-induced reductions in CEA under warming were driven by reductions in Ea (up to 16%, mainly through large reductions in sugar and fat contents) while Ec was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. Treatment groups with a lower CEA value showed a higher mortality and a lower growth rate, indicating bioenergetic responses are contributing to the higher toxicity of chlorpyrifos under warming. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating the effects of pesticides under an increase in both mean temperature and DTF to improve the ecological risk assessment of pesticides under global warming.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,"125369","selected",""

Positive reactions to an increasing heat supply during vegetative season may be hindered for drought-sensitive species by a water deficit in a cold environment, particularly during late winter or early spring. We investigated the radial growth of dark coniferous forest species Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica Ledeb.) growing on slopes of different orientation (south-west, east, and north) near the upper forest boundary in an area undergoing fast climate warming: the Western Sayan Mountains (South Siberia, Russia), near a massive water reservoir. Correlations of tree-ring width chronologies with moving 21-day temperature series were used to more precisely determine the timing of temperature influence; an analysis of extreme and optimal years and multifactor regression modeling were applied to assess the most favorable/unfavorable thermal conditions in the study area and to estimate the tree growth reaction to the current climatic trends, respectively. Despite relatively low variation in growth (standard deviation <0.2), a significant common climatic signal in tree-ring width was found at all sampling sites. On the shaded northern slopes, P. sibirica is only mildly limited by summer temperatures and has a low similarity (correlations and synchronicity of extreme/optimal years) with other sites. Conversely, the growth of A. sibirica and P. sibirica on two sunlit slopes is similar (r = 0.440.81) and has a common pattern of regulation by temperatures before (r = 0.1780.40; April 3  May 4 on average) and more significantly during vegetative season (r = 0.310.44; May 17  August 27 on average). We hypothesize that both species, being drought-sensitive, undergo water stress in the early spring, and exposition of previous years needles to severe temperature variation may lead to partial defoliation and xylem embolism, thus suppressing growth. The patterns of climatic response and species distribution on slopes indicate that A. sibirica is more sensitive to this physiological drought and needs gentler slopes than P. sibirica. Temperature increase in the study area during the last decades have occured about five times faster in the early spring (being enhanced by the reservoir) than in summer. This combination of spring and summer warming leads to an increase in P. sibirica radial growth on the northern slope and the stable growth of both species on sunlit slopes, i.e. providing a tentatively optimistic assessment of the dark coniferous forests near future in the region.  2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,"117458","excluded",""

Experiments have been conducted on six porcine brains. Our results show that the shear moduli of brain tissues decrease approximately linearly with a slope of 0.0410.006kPa/C when the temperature T increases from room temperature (~23C) to body temperature (~37C). A case study has been further conducted which shows that the shear moduli are insensitive to the temperature variation when T is in the range of 37 to 43C and will increase when T is higher than 43C. With the present experimental setup, temperature-dependent elastic properties of brain tissues can be measured in a simulated physiological environment and a non-destructive manner.

Increasing both air and ground temperatures had effects similar to increasing air temperature alone. Mangroves showed the greatest changes in production, but chaparral showed the greatest changes in water stress with changing temperatures.

Understanding the significance of plasticity in evolutionary and ecological contexts requires determining whether observed plasticity is beneficial, and, if so, to what extent plasticity can compensate for environmental change (i.e. is plasticity complete or incomplete). Using site-specific daily temperature records spanning several decades, we test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis by calculating the number of days predicted to exceed the heat tolerance limits of 103 terrestrial ectotherm populations when incorporating observed taxon-specific plasticity and when plasticity is ignored. We find that heat tolerance plasticity can reduce the predicted number of overheating events, although the effects are clade specific with plasticity providing greater benefits to amphibians than to reptiles or arthropods. Despite these benefits, heat tolerance plasticity is incomplete; as temperatures rise, plasticity cannot prevent an increase in the risk of overheating. Specifically, we find that a one degree increase in mean maximum temperature leads to approximately one additional day of predicted overheating during the warmest months of the year, on average. We conducted a broad-scale analysis of the degree to which plasticity in heat tolerance reduces the probability that ectotherms experience temperatures beyond their physiological heat limits. Our results indicate that plasticity in heat tolerance benefits ectotherms, but, consistent with previous studies, those benefits are inadequate to provide complete compensation for global climate change.  2017 The Authors.

The model consists of a series of differential equations which is developed based on physiological characterizations and yet also exhibits analytical solutions. The model has been shown to be accurate and robust. Based on the new thermal regulation model, we have developed a 2D Bayesian classifier.

Plasticity in Daphnia DVM behavior optimizes fitness via trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migration behavior is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light, predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difficult to determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically significant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations; (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia vertical migration; and (3) defining how two anthropogenic stressors (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior.Simulated natural lake stratification were constructed in 8 L (0.5 m tall, 14.5 cm wide) water columns to monitor under controlled laboratory conditions the individual effects of temperature gradients, depth, and metal stressors on Daphnia vertical migration. Three major findings are reported. First, while no difference in thermal preference was found among the four populations studied, within lake populations variability among isolates was high. Second, decoupling temperature and depth revealed that depth was a better predictor of Daphnia migratory patterns over temperature. Third, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper or nickel inhibited classic DVM behavior. These findings revealed the high variability in thermal preference found within Daphnia populations, elucidated the individual roles that depth and temperature have on migratory behavior, and showed how copper and nickel can interfere with the natural response of Daphnia to fish predator cues. Thus contributing to the body of knowledge necessary to predict how natural populations of Daphnia will be affected by climate related changes in lake temperatures and increased presence of anthropogenic stressors.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Data from two replicates of four treatments (two thermal and two feeding regimes) were collected over 6 months corresponding to the main spring to summer growth period. Fish growth was assessed at fortnightly intervals. Small but significant differences in mean fork length (LF) and mass were observed between temperature treatments, with smaller, lighter fish under the variable temperature regime. The effects of temperature regime on growth were independent of food ration. At termination of the experiment, the median LF and mass of fish exposed to the variable temperature regime were estimated, respectively, to be 2 6 and 8 0% less than those under the constant regime. Given the relatively small differences in growth attributable to variable temperature regime in these experiments, it is suggested that mean daily temperatures are adequate to inform juvenile growth models for field-based studies.  2011 The Authors.

Thus, many models that aim to predict insect-pest population dynamics, use meteorological data as input to descriptive functions that predict the development rate, survival and reproduction of pest populations. In most cases, however, these functions/models are laboratory-driven and are based on data from constant-temperature experiments. Therefore, they lack an important optimization and validation steps that test their accuracy under field conditions. Here, we developed a realistic and robust regional framework for modeling the field population dynamics of the global insect pest Bemisia tabaci. First, two non-linear functions, development rate (DR) and female reproduction (EN) were fitted to data collected in constant temperature experiments. Next, nine one-generation field experiments were conducted in order to establish a field-derived database of insect performance, representing a variety of growing conditions (different seasons, regions and host plants). Then, sensitivity analyses were performed for identifying the optimal time-scale for which the running-averaged temperatures should be fed to the model. Setting the time to 6 h (i.e., each of the 24-time steps per day represents the last 6 h average) produced the best fit (RMSD score of 1.59 days, 5.7% of the mean) between the field observations and the model simulations. We hypothesize that the 6 h relevant biological time-scale captures the insect's physiological memory of daily cycling temperature events. Lastly, we evaluated the potential of the developed modeling framework to serve as a decision support tool in pest-management programs by correlating the model predictions with field-observations of three pest control inspectors during 2019. The model successfully predicted the first notable appearance of the insect in the field (completion of the third generation in May). Also, the model correctly identified the sharp rise in abundance (outbreak point) in mid-July (completion of the fifth generation), and the persistent rise in abundance through August and September. Comparing the simulations of the 2018 and 2019 seasons indicated that the model can also serve as a tool for retrospective systematic assessment of major decisions. Taken together, these data demonstrate the model robustness and its potential to provide an excellent decision-making support platform in regional control of pest species.  2020","Article","Scopus",NA,"109402","selected",""

The scenario was a card-based quiz with the robot, which was aimed to induce a stressful state and 16 participants took part in the experiment. Several conditions with variations in the distance, height, and gaze of the robot were tested. A statistically significant variation in temperature in the nasal area of the face was measured while the robot was standing in the personal space of the participant.

Eight stratificationbased forest sites for groups of soil pits and vegetation plots were located throughout the park. Average organic C in the park's forest soils (primarily Andisols, Spodosols, and Inceptisols) was 163 Mg C ha-1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 138-188), and 205.0 Mg C ha-1 (95% CI = 177.9-232.1) with the litter layer included.

Temperature variables, rather than precipitation, were correlated with soil C pools. Site membership accounted for a significant proportion of variance in C stocks, and beta regression indicated that the proportion of total C stored in the soil varied across sites.

Since the dynamics of fluctuations in physiological rhythms exhibit long-term correlation and memory, this study aimed to extend the Poincar plot by calculating the correlation between sequential data points in a time-series, rather than between two consecutive points. By incorporating this so-called lag, we hope to integrate a temporal aspect into quantifying the correlation, to depict whether a physiological system holds prolonged association between events separated by time. In doing so, it attempts to instantaneously characterize the intrinsic behavior of a complex system. We tested this hypothesis on three different physiological time-series: heart rate variability in patients with liver cirrhosis, respiratory rhythm in asthma and body temperature fluctuation in patients with cirrhosis, to evaluate the potential application of the extended Poincar method in clinical practice. When studying the cardiac inter-beat intervals, the extended Poincar plot revealed a stronger autocorrelation for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis compared to less severe cases using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In addition, long-term variability (known as SD2 in the extended Poincar plot) appeared as an independent prognostic variable. This holds significance by acting as a non-invasive tool to evaluate patients with chronic liver disease and potentially facilitate transplant selection as an adjuvant to traditional criteria. For asthmatics, employing the extended Poincar plot allowed for a noninvasive tool to differentially diagnose various classifications of respiratory disease. In the respiratory inter-breath interval analysis, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve provided evidence that the extension of the Poincar plot holds a greater advantage in the classification of asthmatic patients, over the traditional Poincar plot. Lastly, the analysis of body temperature from patients using the extended Poincar plot helped identify inpatients from outpatients with cirrhosis. Through these analyses, the extended Poincar plot provided unique and additional information which could potentially make a difference in clinical practice. Conclusively, the potential use of our work lies in its possible application of predicting mortality for the organ allocation procedure in patients with cirrhosis and non-invasively distinguish between atopic and non-atopic asthma.

Most analyses of the impacts have focused on changes in mean temperature, but increasing variance will also impact organisms and populations. We assessed the combined effects of the mean and the variance of temperature on thermal tolerancesi.e., critical thermal maxima, critical thermal minima, scope of thermal tolerance, and survival in Drosophilamelanogaster. Our six experimental climatic scenarios were: constant mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance; changing mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance. Our key result was that environments with changing thermal variance reduce the scope of thermal tolerance and survival. Heat tolerance seems to be conserved, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with mean low as well as changing environmental temperatures. Flies acclimated to scenarios of changing variancewith either constant or changing mean temperaturesexhibited significantly lower survival rate. Our results imply that changing and constant variances would be just as important in future scenarios of climate change under greenhouse warming as increases in mean annual temperature. To develop more realistic predictions about the biological impacts of climate change, such interactions between the mean and variance of environmental temperature should be considered.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed, physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N. rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10 C all year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical responses during cold exposure (3C). These seven populations showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be established between the amplitude of thermal variations and cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in subterranean crustaceans than in other arthropods.","Article","Scopus","12",NA,"selected",""

This work shows that fingertip temperature variation during VR test can be used as a cost-effective alternative to blood perfusion monitoring.

Blanket bogs, i.e. nutrient-poor peatlands restricted to maritime climates, may be extra vulnerable to global warming since they require a positive water balance to sustain their moss dominated vegetation and C sink functioning. This study presents a 4.5 year record of land-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from the Andya blanket bog in northern Norway. Compared with other peatlands, the Andya peatland exhibited low flux rates, related to the low productivity of the dominating moss and lichen communities and the maritime settings that attenuated seasonal temperature variations. It was observed that under periods of high vapour pressure deficit, net ecosystem exchange was reduced, which was mainly caused by a decrease in gross primary production. However, no persistent effects of dry conditions on the CO2 exchange dynamics were observed, indicating that under present conditions and within the range of observed meteorological conditions the Andya blanket bog retained its C uptake function. Continued monitoring of these ecosystem types is essential in order to detect possible effects of a changing climate.  2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus","2","025004","excluded",""

We used dendroecological methods to test how climatic variability influences aspen grown and mortality in northwestern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Recent growth and mortality of quaking aspen is strongly associated with climatic variation in this region. In stands undergoing recent aspen dieback (1) the growth of aspen was inhibited by warm temperatures, except at the highest elevations (2) the growth of aspen that died was more sensitive to temperature variation prior to mortality than the growth of living aspen, (3) mortality of aspen was preceded by multiple years of reduced growth, and (4) the frequency of mortality was associated with multiple years of drought as indicated by negative PDSI values.

The primary goal of the ATCS is to maintain the thermal comfort during all possible types of human activities in the most fiendly way. The main purpose of ATCS development is the identification of physiologically valuable requirements and validation of optimal laws used to control human thermal status in the suited mode. Such an identification is possible if we have a good knowledge of the control aim and current thermal status. That means that one needs to a criterion for or an assessment of interrelationship between thermal status, activities and disturbances. The model of human thermal regulation and metabolism in a space suit with a ventilation loop and a water cooling loop is a theoretical basis for ATCS experimental tests. Our model has two interdependent parts: 1) anatomical/physiological compartment and 2) technical compartment. The first part is presented by a cylindrical human body simulator that has a core and skin layers. The skin is divided into two ventilated areas with cooling tubes or without them. The physiological compartment includes such mechanisms as perspiration, vasomotor reactions and heat production, the technical compartment includes a liquid cooling garment (LCG), a gas ventilation loop and a space enclosure. It is represented by a multi-layered envelope used to isolate human from environments. This paper presents a functional scheme of man rated tests to be run to identify and validate model parameters determined by analytical techniques. The paper also presents algorithms and block diagrams of the linear model for a theoretical synthesis in the ATCS context.

Primary outcome was oral temperature. We calculated each patients mean temperature, standard deviation within each patient (within-person variability), and between patients (between-person variability). Secondary analysis explored temperature changes in the three days before admission for neutropenic sepsis. 1,755 temperature readings were returned by healthy participants and 1,765 by chemotherapy patients.

In the twenty-first century, such an expectation is unrealistic in regions where global warming induces an increase in terrestrial aridity larger than the changes in aridity driven by ENSO variability. This premise is also flawed in areas where precipitation supply cannot offset the global warming-induced increase in evaporative demand. Here, atmosphere-only experiments are analyzed to identify land regions where aridity is currently sensitive to ENSO and where projected future changes in mean aridity exceed the range caused by ENSO variability. Insights into the drivers of these changes in aridity are obtained using simulations with the incremental addition of three different factors to the current climate: ocean warming, vegetation response to elevated CO2 levels, and intensified CO2 radiative forcing. The effect of ocean warming overwhelms the range of ENSO-driven temperature variability worldwide, increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) in most ENSO-sensitive regions. Additionally, about 39% of the regions currently sensitive to ENSO will likely receive less precipitation in the future, independent of the ENSO phase. Consequently aridity increases in 67%-72% of the ENSO-sensitive area. When both radiative and physiological effects are considered, the area affected by arid conditions rises to 75%-79% when using PET-derived measures of aridity, but declines to 41% when an aridity indicator for total soil moisture is employed. This reduction mainly occurs because plant stomatal resistance increases under enhanced CO2 concentrations, resulting in improved plant water-use efficiency, and hence reduced evapotranspiration and soil desiccation. Imposing CO2-invariant stomatal resistance may overestimate future drying in PET-derived indices.  2017 American Meteorological Society.","Article","Scopus","17",NA,"excluded",""

The nonrigid obstacle also has local thermal fluctuations due to which its shape can change with time and we describe this using fluctuations in the height profile of a one-dimensional interface with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. We find the shape fluctuations of the barrier strongly affect the force generation mechanism. The qualitative nature of the force-velocity curve is crucially determined by the relative time scale of filament and barrier dynamics.

For instance, the thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic and cryophilic homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding. The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for amino acid contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids forming the active site are very different in the open and closed conformations.

Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24C) and DTF treatments (20-30C and 18-38C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6C).

While studies of active matter typically focus on activity via constituent mobility, here, activity is mediated by reproduction and death events in otherwise immobilized cells.

In the light of recent advances in biophysical and structural studies, we argue that intermediate states of translocation are snapshots of dynamic fluctuations that guide the movement. In contrast to current models of stepwise translocation, kinetic evidence shows that the tRNAs move synchronously on the two ribosomal subunits in a rapid reaction orchestrated by EF-G and GTP hydrolysis.

We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 C  0.1 SD (constant) and 20 C  1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Zmax), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the vertical shift or faster-slower hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance.

Our experimental approach demonstrated that temperature variations observed in larval rearing structures on small-scale fish farms are likely to impair the production of giant gourami fry.  2021 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,"736606","selected",""

The experimental results from Hb solutions revealed a direct correlation between protein resilience, melting temperature and average body temperature of the different species on the 0.1 ns time scale. Molecular forces appeared to be adapted to permit conformational fluctuations with a root mean square displacement close to 1.2  at the corresponding average body temperature of the endotherms. Strong forces within crocodile Hb maintain the amplitudes of motion within a narrow limit over the entire temperature range in which the animal lives. In fully hydrated powder samples of human and chicken, Hb mean square displacements and effective force constants on the 1 ns time scale showed no differences over the whole temperature range from 10 to 300 K, in contrast to the solution case. A complementary result of the study, therefore, is that one hydration layer is not sufficient to activate all conformational fluctuations of Hb in the pico- to nanosecond time scale which might be relevant for biological function.

Using experimental lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel climates. Results: We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however, associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions, resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast, lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions: We propose that thermal adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.  2020 The Author(s).","Article","Scopus","1","47","selected",""

Here we use the cyclical parthenogenetic Daphnia pulex to evaluate the role of a fluctuating thermal environment on both reproduction and lifespan across six food concentrations. We test the hypotheses that (1) caloric restriction extends lifespan; (2) maximal reproduction will come with a cost of shortened lifespan; and (3) at a given food concentration, relative to a metabolically equivalent constant temperature environment a diel fluctuating thermal environment will alter the allocation of energy to reproduction and lifespan to maintain homeostasis. We did not identify a level of food concentration that extended lifespan in response to caloric restriction, and we found no cost of reproduction in terms of lifespan. Rather, the individuals at the highest food levels generally had the highest reproductive output and the longest lifespans, the individuals at the intermediate food level decreased reproduction and maintained lifespan, and the individuals at the three lower food concentrations had a decrease in reproduction and lifespan as would be predicted with increasing levels of starvation. Fluctuating temperature had no effect on lifespan at any food concentration, but delayed time to reproductive maturity and decreased early reproductive output at all food concentrations. This suggests that a fluctuating temperature regimen activates molecular pathways that alter energy allocation. The costs of fluctuating temperature on reproduction were not consistent across the lifespan. Statistical interactions for age of peak reproduction and lifetime fecundity suggest that senescence of the reproductive system may vary between temperature regimens at the different food concentrations.  2016 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (20C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.  2014.

In this paper, we study the thermo-mechanical properties of an extensible thermally fluctuating elastic filament under distributed forces. The ground state of the filament is solved first, followed by an investigation of the thermal fluctuations around the ground state. We first consider a special case where the tangential component of the distributed force  is uniform along the filament. For the force-extension relation in this case, we show that the filament is equivalent to one under end-toend applied force F = L0=2 where L0 is the length of the filament. To study the thermal fluctuations under more general distributed loadings, the filament is first discretized into segments, and its energy is approximated up to quadratic order. Then the partition function of the discretized filament, or chain, is evaluated using multi-dimensional Gaussian integrals, from which free energy and other properties of the filament are derived. We show that a filament under distributed loads suffers larger thermal fluctuations than one with the end loads of the same magnitude. We also show that our results for a discretized filament agree with continuum theory for a continuous rod. Finally, we give some applications of our ideas to the stretching and fluctuation of DNA in non-uniform microfluidic channels.

There is a lack of quantitative evidence for the direction and magnitude of these effects. This study assesses the influence of globally-abundant intertidal organisms, barnacles, by measuring the response of limestone, granite and marine-grade concrete colonised with varying percentage covers of Chthamalus spp. under simulated, temperate intertidal conditions. Temperature regimes at 5 and 10mm below the surface of each material demonstrated a consistent and statistically significant negative relationship between barnacle abundance and indicators of thermal breakdown. With a 95% cover of barnacles, subsurface peak temperatures were reduced by 1.59C for limestone, 5.54C for concrete and 5.97C for granite in comparison to no barnacle cover. The amplitudes of short-term (1530min) thermal fluctuations conducive to breakdown via fatigue effects were also buffered by 0.70C in limestone, 1.50C in concrete and 1.63C in granite. Furthermore, concentrations of potentially damaging salt ions were consistently lower under barnacles in limestone and concrete. These results indicate that barnacles do not enhance, but likely reduce rates of mechanical breakdown on rock and concrete by buffering near-surface thermal cycling and reducing salt ion ingress. In these ways, we highlight the potential role of barnacles as agents of bioprotection.

We study how to define consistent stepping and detachment rates for the motors as functions of the local forces acting on them in such a way that the cargo velocity and run-time match previously specified functions of the external load, which are set on the base of experimental results. We show that due to the influence of the thermal fluctuations this is not a trivial problem, even for the single-motor case. As a solution, we propose a motor stepping dynamics which considers memory on the motor force. This model leads to better results for single-motor transport than the approaches previously considered in the literature. Moreover, it gives a much better prediction for the stall force of the two-motor case, highly compatible with the experimental findings. We also analyze the fast fluctuations of the cargo position and the influence of the viscosity, comparing the proposed model to the standard one, and we show how the differences on the single-motor dynamics propagate to the multiple motor situations.

The key question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain stabilized in the presence of high-frequency thermal noise that potentially equates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence of an immature synapse, we show that the high-frequency nodes accompanying large fluctuations are counterbalanced by low-frequency nodes that evolve over longer time periods, eventually leading to signaling of the immunological synapse bond primarily decided by nodes of the latter type. Our analysis shows that such a counterintuitive behavior could be easily explained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed by two distinct phases, corresponding to two separate time exponents, for the two different time regimes. The relatively shorter timescales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond formation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation regime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimate of the bond survival probability, we show that, at shorter timescales, this probability P() scales with time  as a universal function of a rescaled noise amplitude D2, such that P()-(D+12), being the distance from the mean intermembrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation distance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to a universality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a different power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter timescales. In biological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a survival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond justifying its stability.  2015 American Physical Society.","Article","Scopus","1","012706","excluded",""

Using both simulations and qualitative arguments, we show that, when the separation between swimmers is comparable to their size, the swimmers' motions are strongly affected by activity-induced hydrodynamic forces. To further understand these effects, we investigate semidilute suspensions of swimmers in the presence of thermal fluctuations. A direct comparison between simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions shows these to enhance the dynamic clustering at a relatively small volume fraction; with our chosen model the key ingredient for this clustering behavior is hydrodynamic trapping of one swimmer by another, induced by the active forces. Furthermore, the density dependence of the motility (of both the translational and rotational motions) exhibits distinctly different behaviors with and without hydrodynamic interactions; we argue that this is linked to the clustering tendency. Our study illustrates the fact that hydrodynamic interactions not only affect kinetic pathways in active suspensions, but also cause major changes in their steady state properties.  2014 American Physical Society.","Article","Scopus","2","022303","excluded",""

Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to extract dominant motions that in proteins are typically domain motions. These motions are captured in the large eigenvalue (leading) principal components. There is also information in the small eigenvalues, arising from approximate linear dependencies among the coordinates. These linear dependencies suggest that instead of using all the atom coordinates to represent a trajectory, it should be possible to use a reduced set of coordinates with little loss in the information captured by the large eigenvalue principal components. In this work, methods that can monitor the correlation (overlap) between a reduced set of atoms and any number of retained principal components are introduced. For application to trajectory data generated by simulations, where the overall translational and rotational motion needs to be eliminated before PCA is carried out, some difficulties with the overlap measures arise and methods are developed to overcome them. The overlap measures are evaluated for a trajectory generated by molecular dynamics for the protein adenylate kinase, which consists of a stable, core domain, and two more mobile domains, referred to as the LID domain and the AMP-binding domain. The use of reduced sets corresponding, for the smallest set, to one-eighth of the alpha carbon (CA) atoms relative to using all the CA atoms is shown to predict the dominant motions of adenylate kinase. The overlap between using all the CA atoms and all the backbone atoms is essentially unity for a sum over PCA modes that effectively capture the exact trajectory. A reduction to a few atoms (three in the LID and three in the AMP-binding domain) shows that at least the first principal component, characterizing a large part of the LID-binding and AMP-binding motion, is well described. Based on these results, the overlap criterion should be applicable as a guide to postulating and validating coarse-grained descriptions of generic biomolecular assemblies.  2010 American Institute of Physics.","Article","Scopus","24","245101","excluded",""

To date, little is known about the mechanism of protective antioxidative defenses in turtles during acute temperature change, specifically the role that the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) plays. In this study, Chinese soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) were initially acclimated at 28C (3wks), exposed to acute cold condition (8C, 8h) and finally placed in recovery (28C, 24h). L-Gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) mRNA exhibited a stable transcription pattern during the intense thermal fluctuation. GLO activity also remained stable, which validated the mRNA expression pattern. The similar Q10 values for GLO activity in the different treatment groups at incubation temperatures of 28C and 8C indicated that the GLO activity response to thermal change exhibited a temperature-dependent enzymatic kinetic characteristic. The AA storage was tissue-specific as well as the AA re-supply in the recovery period, with brain as the priority. Despite the insufficient transport during cold exposure, the plasma AA reservoir greatly contributed to the redistribution of AA during recovery. Depending on the prominent GLO activity, the high level of tissue-specific AA storage and the extraordinary plasma AA transport potential, the Chinese soft-shelled turtle endured severe thermal fluctuations with no apparent oxidative stress. However, the significant decrease in AA concentration in the brain tissue during acute cold exposure suggested that such a strategy may not be sufficient for prolonged cold exposure.  2015 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

In addition, feeding rate (FR), feeding efficiency (FE) and specific growth rate (SGR) were measured. The diel-fluctuating temperature group showed lower CTmin than the 20C group but a similar CTmax, indicating a wider thermal scope. SDA linearly increased with the temperature. Temperature variation between 20 and 25C had little effect on either swimming or growth performance. However, fish in the 15C group exhibited much poorer swimming and growth performance than those in the 20C group. Ucrit decreased slightly under low acclimation temperature due to the pronounced improvement in swimming efficiency under cold temperature. Fish in the diel-fluctuating temperature group fed more but exhibited similar SGR compared to 20C group, possibly due in part to an increase in energy expenditure to cope with the temperature fluctuation.

The coadaptation hypothesis and its alternatives (suboptimal is optimal, thermodynamic effect, trait variation) are tested. Compared to the optimal movement temperature (22.5C for field-fresh caterpillars and 25, 20, 22.5, 25 and 20C following seven day acclimations to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 515C respectively), caterpillar thermal preference was significantly lower (9.2C for field-fresh individuals and 9.4, 8.8, 8.1, 5.2 and 4.6C following acclimation to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 515C, respectively). Together with the low degree of asymmetry observed in the performance curves, and the finding that acclimation to high temperatures did not result in maximal performance, all, but one of the above hypotheses (i.e. trait variation) was rejected. The thermal preference of P. marioni caterpillars more closely resembles temperatures at which survival is high (510C), or where feeding is optimal (10C), than where locomotion speed is maximal, suggesting that thermal preference may be optimised for overall fitness rather than for a given trait.  2016","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

But the biological effects of an increased night-time temperature combined with high daytime temperature are unclear. We used six thermal regimens to simulate NTs on hot days and investigated the effects of night warming on life-history traits of the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Experimental temperatures fluctuated in continuous diurnal cycles, increasing from 27C to a maximum 35C and then declining to 27C gradually before further dropping to different minima (13, 16, 19, 21, 23 or 25C) representing NTs. When compared to expectations based on constant temperatures, night warming raised the optimum temperature for development by 3C, in contrast to results from experiments where temperature variability was altered symmetrically or in a parallel manner. Night warming also reduced aphid survival under heat from 75% to 37% and depressed adult performance by up to 50%. Overall, night warming exacerbated the detrimental effects of hot days on the intrinsic rate of population increase, which was predicted to drop by 30% when night-time minimum temperatures exceeded 20C. Our novel findings on development challenge the 'Kaufmann effect', suggesting this is inapplicable to night warming likely to be encountered in nature. Although many average temperature models predict increasing pest outbreaks, our results suggest that outbreaks of some species might decrease due to the effects of night warming on population dynamics. Night warming often occurs in hot days under climate change. Here the authors investigate life-history traits of aphids at six night-time temperatures combined with a high daytime temperature regimen. Night warming raises optimum temperature for development which challenges the 'Kaufmann effect' and reduces nymphal survival unexpectedly.  2013 The Authors.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

Whereas processes important for dispersal in space are well known, knowledge of processes governing dispersal in time is still limited. Data for morphological seed traits such as size have given contradictory results for prediction of soil seed persistence or cover only a few species. There have been few experimental studies on the role of germination traits in determining soil seed persistence, while none has studied their predictive value consistently across species. Delayed germination, as well as light requirements for germination, have been suggested to contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. Moreover, diurnally fluctuating temperatures can influence the timing of germination and are therefore linked to seed bank persistence.MethodsThe role of germination speed measured by T50 (days to germination of 50 of all germinated seeds), light requirement and reaction to diurnally fluctuating temperatures in determining seed persistence in the soil was evaluated using an experimental comparative data set of 25 annual cereal weed species.Key ResultsIt is shown that light requirements and slow germination are important features to maintain seeds ungerminated just after entering the soil, and hence influence survival of seeds in the soil. However, the detection of low diurnally fluctuating temperatures enhances soil seed bank persistence by limiting germination. Our data further suggest that the effect of diurnally fluctuating temperatures, as measured on seeds after dispersal and dry storage, is increasingly important to prevent fatal germination after longer burial periods.ConclusionsThese results underline the functional role of delayed germination and light for survival of seeds in the soil and hence their importance for shaping the first part of the seed decay curve. Our analyses highlight the detection of diurnally fluctuating temperatures as a third mechanism to achieve higher soil seed persistence after burial which interacts strongly with season.

KNO3 and GA3 increased germination percentage and germination rate compared to control treatments at 15/5 and 25/15 C. Untreated seeds germinated well (&gt; 80%) at higher temperatures (20, 25 and 28 C), whereas at lower (5, 10 and 15 C) and extremely high temperatures (30 and 32 C) germination decreased significantly. However, after cold stratification (416 weeks), the germination percentage of P. beesiana seeds at low temperatures (515 C) and the germination rate at high temperatures (30 C) increased significantly, suggesting that P. beesiana has type 3 non-deep physiological dormancy. The base temperature and thermal time for germination decreased in seeds that were cold stratified for 16 weeks. Cold-stratified seeds incubated at fluctuating temperatures (especially at 15/5 C) had significantly high germination percentages and germination rates in light, but not in dark, compared to the corresponding constant temperature (10 C). Seeds had a strict light requirement at all temperatures, even after experiencing cold stratification; however, the combinations of cold stratification and fluctuating temperature increased germination when seeds were transferred from dark to light. Such dormancy/germination responses to light and temperature are likely mechanisms that ensure germination occurs only in spring and at/near the soil surface, thus avoiding seedling death by freezing, inundation and/or germination deep in the soil.  2020 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

Seeds were softened at a single field location and in a diurnally fluctuating cabinet (60C/15C). There was significant variation among genotypes in the pattern of seed softening over the first 5 months after senescence. Cultivars Nungarin, Dwalganup, and Geraldton softened most rapidly in late February, whereas cultivars Dalkeith, Urana, and Izmir softened most rapidly in late March. The duration of field exposure required in order for 50% of the first season's softening to occur ranged from 44 to 108 days among the 20 genotypes. Persistence of hard seeds into the second and third years also varied among genotypes. Of the cultivars, Nungarin and Izmir had the highest levels of residual hard seed after 30 months (5.3% and 3.9%, respectively), whereas Dalkeith had the lowest (0.9%).

If heat waves increase in frequency and duration as predicted, it is necessary to understand how these bouts could affect thermally sensitive species, including reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). In a multi-year study using fluctuating temperatures, we exposed Trachemys scripta embryos to cooler, male-producing temperatures interspersed with warmer, female-producing temperatures (heat waves) that varied in either timing during development or continuity and then analysed resulting sex ratios. We also quantified the expression of genes involved in testis differentiation (Dmrt1) and ovary differentiation (Cyp19A1) to determine how heat wave continuity affects the expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation. Heat waves applied during the middle of development produced significantly more females compared to heat waves that occurred just 7 days before or after this window, and even short gaps in the continuity of a heat wave decreased the production of females. Continuous heat exposure resulted in increased Cyp19A1 expression while discontinuous heat exposure failed to increase expression in either gene over a similar time course. We report that even small differences in the timing and continuity of heat waves can result in drastically different phenotypic outcomes. This strong effect of temperature occurred despite the fact that embryos were exposed to the same number of warm days during a short period of time, which highlights the need to study temperature effects under more ecologically relevant conditions where temperatures may be elevated for only a few days at a time. In the face of a changing climate, the finding that subtle shifts in temperature exposure result in substantial effects on embryonic development becomes even more critical.  2020 The Author(s).","Article","Scopus","1932","20200992","selected",""

During a cold stress, chill susceptible insects like Drosophila melanogaster suffer from a loss of ion and water balance, and the current model of recovery from chilling posits that re-establishment of ion homeostasis begins upon return to a warm environment, but that it takes minutes to hours for an insect to fully restore homeostasis. Following this ionoregulatory model of chill coma recovery, we predicted that the longer the duration of the warm periods between cold stresses, the better a fly will endure a subsequent chill coma event and the more likely they will be to survive. We also predicted, however, that this recovery may lead to reduced fecundity, possibly due to allocation of energy reserves away from reproduction. Here, female D.melanogaster were treated to a long continuous cold stress (25h at 0C), or experienced the same total time in the cold with repeated short (15min), or long (120min) breaks at 22C. We found that warm periods in general improved survival outcomes, and individuals that recovered for more time in between cold periods had significantly lower rates of injury, faster recovery from chill coma, and produced greater, rather than fewer, offspring. These improvements in chill tolerance were associated with mitigation of ionoregulatory collapse, as flies that experienced either short or long warm periods better maintained low hemolymph [K+]. Thus, warm periods that interrupt cold periods improve cold tolerance and fertility in D. melanogaster females relative to a single sustained cold stress, potentially because this time allows for recovery of ion and water homeostasis.

Mudflats are an important part of the intertidal zone and experience extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Therein, species would be potentially susceptible to global warming. The present study explored physiological adaptations of burrowing species to life in an intertidal mudflat by analyzing the potential operative temperatures in the mudflat, and assessing cardiac performance and the transcriptional response to thermal stress by a typical burrowing bivalve, the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta in different thermal environments, mimicking conditions during low tides. Clams showed higher thermal sublethal limits in mud with overlying air than in mud with overlying water, indicating an adaptation to rapidly changing ambient temperatures and thermal environments during emersion. This sublethal limit was far above the maximum operative temperature in the actual habitat site and suggests a potential buffer zone to ensure survival under unexpected high temperatures, that could occur with global warming. In response to high temperature, S. constricta exhibited the common heat stress response by up-regulating expression of the Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) and heat shock proteins to cope with the adverse effects of high temperature on protein homeostasis. Increased expression of key genes, including molybdenum cofactor synthesis 3 (MOCS3), oligoribonuclease (REX2), and NFappaB inhibitor alpha (NFIA) may further remit the effect of thermal stress during the emersion period and delay a situation where clams reach their thermal sublethal limit, thereby helping to endure high temperature during low tide. These results clearly illustrate significant adaptations of a burrowing bivalve to life in intertidal mudflats at both physiological and molecular levels and can provide insights into potential physiological or evolutionary responses that could aid survival of mudflat species in a changing global climate.  2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,"136280","selected",""

RESULTS: Eretmocerus warrae attained the highest estimated developmental rate at 31.4 C and the maximum oviposition rate at 30.5 C. Developmental times of E. warrae at fluctuating temperatures that simulate night-day patterns were similar to those predicted based on constant temperatures. Above the optimum temperature, E. warrae tolerated higher constant temperatures than En. formosa during development and as adults. Using a ramping temperature approach, the critical thermal maximum for adult E. warrae was significantly higher than that of adult En. formosa.

Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.  2019.

EHEs and mild temperature periods alternate with each other and form complex climate scenarios. Among these scenarios, low-frequency and short-duration extreme heat events during long mild periods (sporadic short EHEs) and low-frequency and short-duration mild periods during long extreme heat events (sporadic short mild periods) commonly occur in nature. The biological effects of these two types of temperature events have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. To clarify the biological effects of these temperature events on organisms, we selected the English grain aphid, a globally important cereal pest, as our model system. We exposed aphids to simulated 24-h diurnal fluctuating temperatures, inserted these events during the wheat growing season and then investigated development, adult longevity, fecundity, survival, and demographic parameters. We found that sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE could improve their life history traits. Increasing the duration of mild periods from 1 day to 2 days did not significantly change their demographic performance. Sporadic short EHEs during a long mild period did not significantly affect vital rates, while increasing the duration of EHEs from 1 day to 2 days worsened the aphids performance. We found that short mild episodes in the hot season may benefit small insects to buffer long duration heatwaves. We discussed how sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE supplied aphids a chance to recover from heat stress. Thus, we suggest that sporadic temperature events should be considered in population prediction of small insects under climate change and should be integrated into pest management.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Diel metabolite profiles were largely captured in sinusoidal simulations at similar DLIs in controlled-environment chambers, except that amino acids were lower in natural light regimes. We now extend the DLI12 study by investigating metabolism in a natural light regime with variable temperature including cool nights. Starch was not completely turned over, anthocyanins and proline accumulated, and protein content rose. Instead of decreasing, amino acid content rose. Connectivity in central metabolism, which decreased in variable light, was not further weakened by variable temperature. We propose that diel metabolism operates better when light and temperature are co-varying. We also compared transcript abundance of 10 circadian clock genes in this temperature-variable regime with the temperature-controlled natural and sinusoidal light regimes.

A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various '-omics' techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be explored more thoroughly.

Both sides of the debate agree that large eggs in shallow nests laid in sun-exposed soil will experience clines in mean temperature and (especially) diel thermal variance; that embryos in the middle phase of development have the ability to reposition themselves, and room to do so; and that small changes in developmental temperatures can influence offspring fitness. Equally, all protagonists agree that thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in development. Based on an array of other fitness-enhancing behaviors exhibited by tetrapod embryos, and general principles for recognizing adaptation, we conclude that behavioral thermoregulation inside the egg likely is adaptive in some but not all reptile species.

Glycolysis is the most important metabolic pathways. Abstract: Magnolia sieboldii K. Koch was selected as our research object. M. sieboldii seeds were initially soaked in clean water for 72h and then stratified in wet sand with a seed-to-sand ratio of 1:3 at a fluctuating temperature. The relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and seed germination, and the localization of related proteins in metabolic pathways were investigated through seed embryo development, seed anatomical structure, carbohydrate change, and differentially accumulated protein analysis during seed stratification. On the basis of the results, we can divide seed dormancy and germination into three stages: unchanging embryo length (phase I), slow stretching phase (phase II), and rapid elongation phase (phase III). Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that 67 differentially accumulated proteins were obtained in four seed protein samples corresponding to the four key stages during the stratification of M. sieboldii seeds (0, 45, 90, and 110days of stratification). Of the 67 differentially accumulated proteins, 7 were related to carbon metabolism and localized in 10 metabolic pathways and 4 were located in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and upregulated in the early stage of seed germination, as indicated by KEGG metabolic pathway analysis. Thus, energy for seed germination was provided by glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in this stage.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

We examined how daily temperature fluctuations, average temperature, day length and vernalization influence the flowering time of 59 genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with allelic perturbations known to affect flowering time. For a subset of genotypes, we also assessed treatment effects on morphology and growth. We identified 17 genotypes, many of which have high levels of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), that bolted dramatically earlier in fluctuating - as opposed to constant - warm temperatures (mean = 22C). This acceleration was not caused by transient VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-mediated vernalization, differential growth rates or exposure to high temperatures, and was not apparent when the average temperature was cool (mean = 12C). Further, in constant temperatures, contrary to physiological expectations, these genotypes flowered more rapidly in cool than in warm environments. Fluctuating temperatures often reversed these responses, restoring faster bolting in warm conditions. Independently of bolting time, warm fluctuating temperature profiles also caused morphological changes associated with shade avoidance or 'high-temperature' phenotypes.

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.73C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.73C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5C (low), 27.1C (medium) or 27.7C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and overwinter survival.  2016.

Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the up-regulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18. C, constant 28. C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28. C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation.  2015 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

In early spring we observed newly emerged Drosophila subobscura, which had overwintered as larvae and pupae. As temperatures increase during spring these flies are faced with higher minimum and maximum temperatures in their natural microhabitat. Thus, there is a potential costly mismatch between winter and early spring acclimatization and the increased ambient temperatures later in adult life. We obtained individuals from a natural Danish population of D. subobscura and acclimated them in the laboratory to 20. C for one generation, and compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) to that of individuals collected directly from their natural microhabitat. The two populations (laboratory and field) were subsequently both held in the laboratory at 20. C and tested for their CTmax and CTmin every third day for 28. days. At the first day of testing, field acclimatized D. subobscura had both higher heat and cold resistance compared to laboratory flies, and thereby a considerable larger thermal scope. Following transfer to the laboratory, cold and heat resistance of the field flies decreased over time relative to the laboratory flies. Despite the substantial decrease in thermal tolerances the thermal scope remained larger for field acclimatized individuals for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that flies acclimatized to their natural microhabitat had increased cold resistance, without a loss in heat tolerance. Thus while a negative correlation between cold and heat tolerance is typically observed in laboratory studies in Drosophila sp., this was not observed for field acclimatized D. subobscura in this study. We suggest that this is an adaptation to juvenile overwintering in temperate cold environments, where developmental (winter) temperatures can be much lower than temperatures experienced by reproducing adults after emergence (spring). The ability to gain cold tolerance through acclimatization without a parallel loss of heat tolerance affects thermal scope and suggests that high and low thermal tolerance act through mechanisms with different dynamics and reversibility.  2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations. These findings highlight the complexity of factors affecting trait evolution in natural populations and indicate that caution is required when inferring likely evolutionary responses from the outcome of experimental evolution studies.  2015 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.

The lower developmental thresholds of the immature stages were estimated by a linear model and ranged from 4.63 C (pupal stage) to 7.69 C (egg stage). The developmental thresholds estimated by a nonlinear model were slightly higher than those estimated by the linear model. Adult longevity and fecundity were reduced at mean fluctuating temperatures 17.5 and 32.5 C, but tended to be independent of the pattern of temperature change at moderate temperatures.

Parasitized third-instar diamondback moth larvae were reared until adult mortality in individual thermal gradient cells at different temperature regimes. Larval mortality, parasitism success, pupal mortality, larval and pupal developmental time, adult longevity, and pupal and adult dry weight were recorded. Overall diamondback moth larval mortality was low. The pupal mortality of D. insulare increased with increasing temperature; however, diamondback moth did not show such a response. Greatest parasitism success (67%) was found at constant and fluctuating 22C and fluctuating 7C, and the lowest (30%) at fluctuating 30C. Longer development times and greater pupal body masses occurred at lower temperatures for both insects. Significant differences occurred between constant and fluctuating temperature regimes for most parameters of both insects.

In these species, the timing of adult eclosion with the onset of wintering conditions is critical, because adults exposed to long pre-wintering periods show increased lipid loss and winter mortality. Populations from warm areas fly in February-March and are exposed to longer growth seasons than populations from colder areas, which fly in April-May. Given their inability to produce an extra generation, early-flying populations should develop more slowly than late-flying populations and thus avoid the negative consequences of long pre-wintering periods. In this study we compare the development under natural and laboratory conditions of phenologically-distinct populations in two Osmia species. Early-flying populations took 2. months longer to develop than late-flying populations. Differences between populations in larval and pupal period duration were very small, whereas the prepupal period was much longer in early-flying populations. In contrast to the larval and pupal stages, the prepupal stage showed a non-linear response to temperature, was strongly affected by thermoperiod, and exhibited minimum respiration rates. Coupled with other lines of evidence, these results suggest that the prepupal period in Osmia corresponds to a summer diapause, and its duration may be under local selection to synchronize adult eclosion with the onset of winter temperatures.

However, sexual dimorphism is evolving rapidly following environmental change, suggesting that sexual dimorphism and its genetic background could be environmentally sensitive. Yet few studies have explored the sensitivity of the genetic background of sexual dimorphism on environmental variation. In this study, on Drosophila melanogaster, we used a large nested full-sib-half-sib breeding design where families were split into four different developmental temperatures: two constant temperature treatments of 25 and 30C and two cycling temperatures with means of 25 and 30C, respectively. After emergence, we tested heat shock tolerance of adult flies. We found that sexual dimorphism was strongly affected by temperature during development. Moreover, we found that female heritability was significantly lower in flies developing at hot temperature and more so under hot and cycling temperatures. Interestingly, most of the genetic variation for heat shock tolerance was orthogonal (i.e. noncorrelated) between sexes, allowing independent evolution of heat shock tolerance in males and females. These findings give support to the hypothesis that the evolution of sexual dimorphism can be influenced by the environments experienced during development.  2012 The Authors.

The interaction between an internal seed dormancy mechanism and the ruling environmental conditions allows accurate cueing of germination. We analysed how environmental signals interact in seeds of temperate forest pioneer species, increasing the seed's chances of germinating in the right place at the right time. Digitalis purpurea and Scrophularia nodosa are two small-seeded herbaceous species that typically grow in vegetation gaps in European temperate forests. Seeds of both species are partially dormant at the time of dispersal in summer. This primary dormancy is released in autumn and early winter, resulting in a minimal level of physiological dormancy by late winter and early spring. We observed that physiological dormancy was induced again in seeds exhumed in late spring and in summer. Experiments in laboratory conditions revealed that primary dormancy in seeds of S nodosa was broken by cold stratification, whereas primary dormancy in D. purpurea seeds was broken by both a cold and a warm stratification. The two species differed in their response to the tested gap-detection signals, as light was the most important factor stimulating germination of D. purpurea, and seeds of S. nodosa germinated best when subjected to daily fluctuating temperatures. This study clearly indicates that the ability to germinate in response to gap-detection signals changes seasonally in temperate forest pioneers. Additionally, seeds of both species responded differently to these environmental signals, probably reflecting differences in the regeneration niche.  2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

In temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) species, offspring sex-ratio is dependent on the environmental temperature. For oviparous sauropsid species, temperature within the nest influences gonadal sexual differentiation during a small window of embryogenesis called the thermosensitive period (TSP). 2. The absence of sexual dimorphic characteristic in juveniles of TSD species coupled with the lack of a non-invasive method to determine sex is a great obstacle to studies estimating sex-ratios under natural conditions. Some authors have proposed proxies of sex-ratio obtained through correlative approaches. They commonly extrapolate the empirical profile of sex-ratios as a function of constant incubation temperature established for several species in the laboratory to a field context. However, most of these proxies have been refuted by studies realized under field conditions, and consequently they cannot be used to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. 3. Here, we propose a new thermal model of TSD using a mechanistic approach. We built this model from a collection of published data of physiological processes (i.e. the growth of the embryo, the growth of gonads and the activity of the enzyme aromatase) underlying the TSD mechanism, for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). This new approach provides integration of incubation temperature fluctuations, as well as the cumulative and differential effect of high and low temperatures on sexual differentiation to embryo sex determination. 4. The significant consistency obtained between observed and predicted sex-ratios both at diverse constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures provides hope to develop an efficient method to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. The reliable validity of this new model could have wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the TSD mechanism, as well as its evolutionary and ecological consequences in natural populations.  2007 The Authors.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

Therefore, 29 isolates of B. bassiana were tested for their ability to germinate and grow in temperature and water availability conditions prevailing during the pest season in these fields. The effect of temperature cycles with 8 h duration of high temperature fluctuating with 16 h duration of lower temperature (similar to field conditions); low water availability; and a combination of these two stress conditions was studied. Germination and growth assays were done at fluctuating temperature cycles of 32, 35, 38, and 42  1C (8 h)/25  1C (16 h) and in media with water stress created by 10, 20, 30, and 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). Assays set at a continuous temperature of 25  1C with no PEG in the medium served as controls. Stress was assessed as percentage germination or as growth relative to control. Isolates showing 90% growth relative to the control at temperature cycles including high temperatures of 35 and 38  1C were identified. One isolate (ARSEF 2860) had a thermal threshold above 43C. At 25C, all but one isolate of B. bassiana showed >90% growth relative to the control in 10% PEG (-0.45 MPa). Some isolates were found with >90% growth relative to control in medium having 30% PEG with water availability (1.33 MPa), nearly equivalent to that in soils which induce permanent wilting point of plants. When isolates that showed >90% growth relative to the control at both stress conditions, were stressed simultaneously, a decrease in growth was observed. Growth was reduced by 20% at 35  1C (8 h)/25  1C (16 h) and 10% PEG and was affected to a greater degree in combinations of harsher stress conditions. The isolate ARSEF 2860 with a thermal threshold of >43C showed 80% relative growth at a combined stress of 38  1C (8 h)/25  1C (16 h) and 10% PEG.

Two directly cooled systems, one equipped with a thermal expansion valve and the other one with an electronically controlled stepper motor driven valve, were compared to a jacketed cooling system. Decay of stored vegetables proved to be higher at quick temperature and vapour pressure deficit fluctuations with small hysteresis values compared to storage conditions fluctuating slowly with relatively high deviations. Such a result was unexpected. Thus there was a need to construct a research system to study the effect of variable fluctuating storage conditions on post-harvest reactions of plant organs.

The system includes 12 acrylic cuvettes, a volume of 26 litres each. The temperatures in these cuvettes can be increased periodically by power-controlled heating elements and cooled down through the outer surface. Investigating physiological reactions of vegetables stored at differently fluctuating conditions transpiration and respiration rates of crops are determined by infra-red absorption in an open system. Temperature and humidity conditions in each cuvette are measured using high accuracy systems.

Although vital to predicting how parasitism will respond to climate change, thermal responses of both host and parasite in key traits affecting infection dynamics have rarely been quantified. Through temperature-controlled experiments on an ectothermic hostparasite system, we demonstrate an offset in the thermal optima for survival of infected and uninfected hosts and parasite production. We combine experimentally derived thermal performance curves with field data on seasonal host abundance and parasite prevalence to parameterize an epidemiological model and forecast the dynamical responses to plausible future climate-warming scenarios. In warming scenarios within the coastal southeastern United States, the model predicts sharp declines in parasite prevalence, with local parasite extinction occurring with as little as 2 C warming. The northern portion of the parasites current range could experience local increases in transmission, but assuming no thermal adaptation of the parasite, we find no evidence that the parasite will expand its range northward under warming. This work exemplifies that some host populations may experience reduced parasitism in a warming world and highlights the need to measure host and parasite thermal performance to predict infection responses to climate change.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

The development of forecast models is necessary for proactive disease management, but past studies have frequently reported thermal performance data in idiosyncratic ways that have limited use for parameterizing thermal host-parasite models. Development of improved forecast models will require strong collaborations between experimental parasitologists and disease modelers. The purpose of this article is to facilitate such collaborations by reviewing practical considerations for describing thermal performance curves of parasite and host performance traits, and using them to predict climate change impacts on host-parasite systems. In the first section, we provide an overview of how thermal performance curves can be embedded in life-cycle-based dynamical models of parasitism, and we outline how such models can capture the net effect of multiple nonlinear temperature dependencies affecting the host-parasite dynamics. We also discuss how macroecological generalities based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) can be used to determine a priori parameter estimates for thermal performance curves to derive null models for data-deficient species, but we note that most of the generalities suggested by MTE remain to be tested for parasites. In the second section, we discuss empirical knowledge gaps for the temperature dependence of parasite and host performance traits, and we outline the types of data that need to be collected to inform MTE-based models for data-deficient species. We specifically emphasize the importance of (1) capturing the entire thermal response of performance traits, including lower and upper temperature thresholds, and (2) experimentally or statistically separating out the thermal responses of different performance traits (e.g., development and mortality) rather than only reporting composite measures (e.g., apparent development). Not adhering to these principles can lead to biased climate change impact predictions. In the third section, we provide a practical guide outlining how experimentalists can contribute to fill data gaps by measuring the temperature dependence of host and parasite performance traits in ways that are systematic, statistically rigorous, and consistent with the requirements of life cycle-based host-parasite models. This guide includes recommendations and practical examples illustrating (1) the use of perturbation analyses to determine experimental priorities, (2) experimental design tips for quantifying thermal response curves, and (3) statistical methods for estimating the parameters of thermal performance curves. Our hope is that this article helps researchers to maximize the value and use of future data collections for both empirical and modelling studies investigating the way in which temperature influences parasitism.

Moreover, of the different types of anthropogenic activity impacting rivers, the construction of dams appears to have multi-dimensional effects on the river environment, and it especially affects the thermal condition of rivers. The aim of the study is to identify and assess the impact of these two distinct sources of water temperature distortion in relation to the natural thermal conditions of rivers. In the study, linear trend analysis and a complex wavelet transform are used. The analysis focuses on daily river water temperature data for time periods before and after the construction of selected reservoirs in the Polish Carpathians, and on daily air temperature data for neighboring meteorological stations. Three rivers were selected for analysis: (1) Dunajec River, 22 km downstream of the CzorsztynSromowce Wyne reservoir complex, (2) Ropa River, 16 km downstream of the Klimkwka Reservoir, and (3) Wisok River, 33 km downstream of the Besko Reservoir. Research has shown that the significant increasing trends identified for water temperature are weaker than analogous trends in air temperature. The CzorsztynSromowce Wyne and Klimkwka reservoirs appear to exert considerable influence on natural airwater temperature synchronization, because the phase difference increases 5-fold in comparison with conditions prior to the construction of the reservoirs. The weakening of the natural airwater temperature synchrony implies diminished impact of air temperature on stream water temperature. However, this creates an opportunity for preparing appropriate management practices mitigating an increasing temperature trend in order to shape more favorable (natural) thermal conditions for native aquatic biota in impounded rivers.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

We found that respiration was consistently more temperature dependent than photosynthesis across 18 diverse marine phytoplankton, resulting in universal declines in the rate of carbon fixation with short-term increases in temperature. Long-term experimental evolution under high temperature reversed the short-term stimulation of metabolic rates, resulting in increased rates of carbon fixation.

Understanding how temperature regulates species distributions is particularly important for mobile marine fauna such as sharks given their seemingly rapid responses to warming, and the socio-political implications of human encounters with some dangerous species. The predictability of species distributions can potentially be improved by accounting for temperature's influence on performance, an elusive relationship for most large animals. We combined multi-decadal catch data and bio-logging to show that coastal abundance and swimming performance of tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier are both highest at ~22C, suggesting thermal constraints on performance may regulate this species' distribution. Tiger sharks are responsible for a large proportion of shark bites on humans, and a focus of controversial control measures in several countries. The combination of distribution and performance data moves towards a mechanistic understanding of tiger shark's thermal niche, and delivers a simple yet powerful indicator for predicting the location and timing of their occurrences throughout coastlines. For example, tiger sharks are mostly caught at Australia's popular New South Wales beaches (i.e. near Sydney) in the warmest months, but our data suggest similar abundances will occur in winter and summer if annual sea surface temperatures increase by a further 12C.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

Resource exploration activities are currently having profound effects on hydrological and ecological processes in sub-arctic peatlands. In wetland-dominated zones of discontinuous permafrost, permafrost occurs below tree-covered peat plateaus where the tree-canopy and vadose zone act to insulate and preserve permafrost below. Linear disturbances such as seismic lines result in removal of the canopy, and cause permafrost thaw, which results in increased soil moisture, land subsidence, and deforestation. This contributes to land-cover transformation, habitat and vegetation loss, and changes to basin hydrologic cycles. The resultant permafrost-degraded corridors comprise large portions of the drainage density of sub-arctic basins, and alter the region's water and energy balances. Mulching over disturbances, with the removed tree canopy, has been proposed as a best management practice to help reduce this environmental impact. Here we present climate chamber and numerical modeling results which quantify the effects of mulching and its ability to limit permafrost thaw and alterations to the ground thermal regime. Overall, the thermal buffering ability of the mulch had beneficial effects on slowing thaw, due to its low thermal conductivity, which decouples the subsurface from meteorological forcing and impedes heat conduction. Results indicate that mulching is an effective technique to reduce permafrost thaw and provides a scientific basis to assess the mitigation measure on its ability to slow permafrost degradation.

This challenge can be approached mechanistically by establishing linkages from biophysics to community ecology. For example, body temperature can be predicted from environmental conditions and species-specific morphological and behavioral traits. Variation in body temperature within and among species dictates physiological performance, rates of resource acquisition, and growth. These ecological characteristics, along with population size, define the strength with which species interact. Finally, the direct (individual level) and indirect (community level) effects of temperature jointly determine community structure. This mechanistic framework can complement correlational approaches to better predict ecological responses to climate change and identify which characteristics of a species or community act as leverage points for change.

Composition of water (N = 13) has the following mean values: pH 8.36, conductivity 1591 S cm-1, dominant ions (in mg l-1) CO312.77, CO3H- 140.27, C1- 246.86, SO4 460.14, Na+ 400.45, K+ 2.18, Ca++ 27.68 and Mg++ 2.14. Mean total dissolved solids: 1.3 g 1-1. Large amounts of SO4, Na+, and C1- are noticeable traits. Sixteen fish species (2460 specimens) were captured in the warmed reach. Dominant families were Characidae, Cichlidae and Loricariidae. New geographic distribution information is provided for eight species, some of them with restricted northwestern Argentina distributions. Most abundant species were the eurytopic characid Astyanax bimaculatus, followed by the cichlid Bujurquina vittata. These species have the highest critical thermal maximum according to field experiments. Temperature of acclimatization is closer to lethal than in fishes from 'normal' habitats. Agua Caliente differs from other thermal habitats in the lack of isolation, its placement in a rain forest area, a high number of species, and the lack of cyprinodontoids. The fish fauna here represents an opportunistic invasion of a habitat with water parameters strongly different from those in the area, particularly temperature and salinity. Both faunistic and limnological traits make of Agua Caliente a new type of environment within the subtropics.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

Changes to active and passive transport across epithelia during chilling likely drive the collapse of ion gradients, metabolic imbalance and potentially oxidative stress. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata transcriptomic evidence provides support for these responses at the level of gene expression, but variable expression profiles between life stages in M. rotundata indicate that different mechanisms could be responsible for repairing and protecting against chill injuries across development. Herein, we test the hypotheses that 1) chill injury leads to oxidative stress and damage in insects and 2) exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) promotes an increased oxidative stress response leading to a decrease in damage by reactive oxygen species. We measured the expression of transcripts with products known to have antioxidant properties in overwintering prepupae as well as total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation during both extended overwintering in prepupae and low temperature stress during pupal development. We observed differential gene expression for the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase and several transcripts with putative antioxidant properties including vitellogenin, apolipoprotein D, glutathione S-transferase, and nuclear protein 1. However, the expression of transcripts coding for other enzymatic antioxidants did not change between treatments. Neither life stage varied in their capacity to cope with an induced oxidative stress after FTR exposure and we did not observe evidence of lipid peroxidation in chill injured (STR) prepupae. These results did not support our initial hypotheses and indicate that oxidative-stress-induced damage is neither a causal factor or symptom of chill injury.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,"103935","selected",""

One potential way to control this pest is the sterile insect technique (SIT) which demands a large stock of reproductive females to produce millions of sterile males to be released on demand. Unfortunately, Drosophila stocks age quickly, show declining fecundity when maintained at warm temperatures and conversely, they die from chill injury if they are maintained at constant low temperature. Here we investigate the potential of fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) as a storage method that harness the benefits of both warm and cold storage. Using a FTR with a daily warm period (1 h 20 at 25 C) and cold period (20 h at 3 C), interspaced by gradual heating and cooling, we compared longevity, fecundity and physiological condition between FTR females and females exposed to constant 25 C and 3 C. As hypothesised, FTR flies experienced much slower senescence (>3-fold increase in lifespan) and they preserved fecundity to a much higher age than flies from constant 25 C. Flies maintained at constant 3 C quickly died from chill injuries caused by a gradual loss of ion and water balance. In contrast, FTR flies were able to maintain ion and water balance (similar to 25 C flies) as they were allowed to recover homeostasis during the short warm periods. Together these results demonstrate that FTR represents a useful protocol for storage of Drosophila stocks, and more broadly, this shows that the benefits of FTR are tightly linked with the insect ability to recover physiological homeostasis during the short warm periods.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

This study attempts to improve a former stream temperature model (STM) which was developed for the salmons habitat to simulate stream temperature more realistically. Two modules, solar radiation modification (SRM) and surface/subsurface runoff mixing (RM), were incorporated to overcome the limitation of STM designed only for clear-sky conditions. It was found that daily temperature difference is related to cloud cover and can be used to adjust the effects of cloud cover on incident solar radiation to the ground level. The modified model (STM + SRM) improved the simulation during a baseflow period in both winter and summer with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient improved from 0.37 (by STM only) to 0.71 for the winter and from 0.18 to 0.70 for the summer. On the days with surface/subsurface runoff, the incorporation of the two new modules together (STM + SRM + RM) improved the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient from 0.00 to 0.65 and from 0.29 to 0.83 in the winter and the summer, respectively. Meanwhile, the contributions of major thermal sources to stream temperature changes were identified. Groundwater is a major controlling factor for regulating seasonal changes of stream temperature while solar radiation is the primary factor controlling daily stream temperature variations.

However, the relationship between the environment and body temperature can be altered by morphology and ecology. In particular, body size and body shape can impact thermal inertia, as high surface area to volume ratios will possess low thermal mass. Habitat type can also influence thermal physiology by altering the opportunity for thermoregulation. We studied the thermal ecology and physiology of an elongate invertebrate, the bark centipede (Scolopocryptops sexspinosus). We characterized field body temperature and environmental temperature distributions, measured thermal tolerance limits, and constructed thermal performance curves for a population in southern Georgia. We found evidence that bark centipedes behaviorally thermoregulate, despite living in sheltered microhabitats, and that performance was maintained over a broad range of temperatures (over 20 C). However, both the thermal optimum for performance and upper thermal tolerance were much higher than mean body temperature in the field. Together, these results suggest that centipedes can thermoregulate and maintain performance over a broad range of temperatures but are sensitive to extreme temperatures. More broadly, our results suggest that wide performance breadth could be an adaptation to thermal heterogeneity in space and time for a species with low thermal inertia.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,"102755","selected",""

However, quantifying thermal acclimation in biological rate processes is not straightforward because many rates increase with temperature due to the acute effect of thermodynamics on molecular interactions. Disentangling such passive plastic responses from active acclimation responses is critical for describing patterns of thermal acclimation. Here, we reviewed published studies and distinguished between different study designs measuring the acute (i.e. passive) and acclimated (i.e. active) effects of temperature on metabolic rate. We then developed a method to quantify and classify acclimation responses by comparing acute and acclimated Q10 values. Finally, we applied this method using meta-analysis to characterize thermal acclimation in metabolic rates of ectothermic animals. We reviewed 258 studies measuring thermal effects on metabolic rates, and found that a majority of these studies (74%) did not allow for quantifying the independent effects of acclimation. Such studies were more common when testing aquatic taxa and continue to be published even in recent years. A meta-analysis of 96 studies where acclimation could be quantified (using 1,072 Q10 values) revealed that partial compensation was the most common acclimation response (i.e. acclimation tended to offset the passive change in metabolic rate due to acute temperature changes). However, no acclimation and inverse compensation, in which acclimation further augmented the acute change in metabolic rate, were also common. Acclimation responses differed among taxa, habitats and with experimental design. Amphibians and other terrestrial taxa tended to show weak acclimation responses, whereas fishes and other aquatic taxa tended to show stronger compensatory responses. Increasing how long the animal was allowed to adjust to a new test temperature increased the acclimation response, but body size did not. Acclimation responses were also stronger with longer acclimation durations. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of using the appropriate experimental design to investigate and estimate thermal acclimation of biological rates. To facilitate and guide future studies of thermal acclimation, we end with some suggestions for designing and interpreting experiments.

Because many of the underlying mechanisms of foraging are temperature dependent in ectotherms, the distribution of ectothermic foragers between food patches may similarly depend on temperature because the difference in fitness rewards between these patches may change with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of Common Gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) between food patches can be explained by an IFD, but that conformance to an IFD weakens as temperature departs from the optimal temperature because fitness rewards, interference competition and the number of individuals foraging are highest at the optimal temperature. First, we determined the optimal temperature for foraging. Second, we examined group foraging at three temperatures and three density treatments. Search time was optimized at 27C, handling time at 29C and digestion time at 32C. Gartersnakes did not match an IFD at any temperature, but their distribution did change with temperature: snakes at 20C and at 30C selected both food patches equally, while snakes at 25C selected the low food patch more at low density and the high food patch more at high density. Food consumption and competition increased with temperature, and handling time decreased with temperature. Temperature therefore had a strong impact on foraging, but did not affect the IFD.

In this study, we model a community of symmetric competitors in a fluctuating environment. We use biologically realistic temperature-dependent growth curves with a widely hypothesized trade-off between maximum growth and nice breadth to control the shapes of the curves of different species. We perform three analyses of the community dynamics to investigate the role of environmental fluctuations in community composition and species diversity. We initiate communities with equal abundances of all species and randomize the temperature fluctuations so that there is no correlation between species responses, only noise. We initiate single populations and allow other species to randomly invade the community. We also knock out extant species one by one from an established community and allow them to reinvade after the remaining species have adjusted. We find that competitors with sufficiently different temperature niches coexist via temporal niche differentiation. We also find long-term persistence of species that are very similar to a dominant competitor. This creates communities with species clumped along a temperature niche axis, with stable coexistence between groups and near neutrality within groups. The near neutrality results in interspecific synchrony within the groups, providing an explanation for the maintenance of high diversity in competitive communities where synchrony is commonly observed.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

Classic cost-benefit models of ectothermic thermoregulation postulate that ectotherms should increase thermoregulatory effort when the benefits of thermoregulatory behavior outweigh the costs (Huey and Slatkin, 1976). However, alteration of habitat via land management may lead to unforeseen shifts in microclimate that change associated costs and benefits. In light of anthropogenic impacts on natural habitats, thermoregulatory effort should be examined in cases where land management results in environmental temperatures that deviate from the preferred temperature range of a given species. We examined how habitat management alters microclimates and influences activity time, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology in a lizard (Sceloporus woodi) whose range has been significantly reduced due to habitat loss. We compared populations from two ecologically distinct habitats: longleaf pine and sand pine scrub, which have very different management histories. Daily surveys were conducted in each habitat type while environmental temperatures were recorded simultaneously with biophysical models. Thermal performance curves differed between populations such that physiological performance was optimized in each environment. Longleaf pine habitat had greater thermal opportunity because cooler microclimates were available on arboreal perches. In longleaf pine habitat, lizards were able to stay active longer and thermoregulate more effectively. Regardless of habitat, thermoregulatory effort of S. woodi increased when thermal quality of habitat was low. However, when unfavorably high temperatures were experienced, the thermoregulatory effort increased significantly. Our results demonstrate that ectotherms can afford to imprecisely thermoregulate when habitat thermal quality is poor due to cooler environmental temperatures. However under unfavorably hot environmental temperatures, lizards must precisely regulate body temperature in spite of any costs. These results further demonstrate that habitat management has major implications on species-specific thermal opportunity, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology, such that shifts in thermoregulatory behavior may lead to higher energetic costs, enhanced predation risk, and constrained activity times.

Despite these expected changes, assessing climate change effects on habitat and fish over large regions has proven challenging. The goal of this study is to describe an approach to assess and identify stream reaches within a large region that are susceptible to climate changes based on responses of multiple fish species to changes in thermal and hydrological habitats occurring with changes in climate. We present a six-step approach to connect climate, habitat, and fish responses, demonstrated through an example to assess effects of climate change on fishes for all stream reaches in a large U.S. ecoregion (955,029 km2). Step 1 identified measures of air temperature and precipitation expected to change substantially in the future. Step 2 identified the climatic measures strongly associated with stream thermal and hydrologic metrics calculated from measured data from a subset of streams. Step 3 linked thermal and hydrologic metrics identified in Step 2 with abundances of fish species from the same stream reaches, and these fishes were combined into groups based on similar associations with specific thermal or hydrologic metrics. Step 4 used the linkages between fish groups and climatic measures and their associated thermal and hydrologic metrics to classify stream reaches. Step 5 assigned all stream reaches into classes based on the established classification under current climate measures and then re-assigned all stream reaches using projected climatic measures for three future time windows. Step 6 assessed changes in classes of stream reaches between current and future climate conditions. Stream reaches projected to change in stream classes were considered vulnerable to future climate change, as they would no longer support the same fish composition. The projected vulnerable streams for the years 2040, 2060, and 2090 were mapped and summarized to identify temporal patterns and identify their spatial distribution, along with underlying mechanisms leading to changes. Our results showed that 45.7% of the 320,000 reaches and 49.3% of the overall 650,000 km stream length in the study region were expected to change stream class by the year 2090, with spatially-explicit changes including streams' responding to changing air temperature or precipitation. This study provides critical guidance for integrating climate projections, landscape factors, stream habitat data, and fish data into a meaningful approach for understanding linkage. Outcomes greatly improve our ability to describe habitat changes at a stream reach scale throughout large regions, and they can aid in prioritizing management strategies to adapt to climate change at local and regional scales.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,"142503","selected",""

However, there still lacks a systematic evaluation on the effect of warming on soil thermodynamics in the different ecosystems of permafrost regions. This study investigated the alterations of soil thermodynamics in alpine swamp meadow and alpine steppe under experimental warming by open-top chambers in permafrost regions of the central Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that air temperature increased significantly with an annual mean increase of 1.4 C under warming. Compared to alpine swamp meadow, soil thermodynamics represented by soil temperature, soil thermal parameters, soil freeze-thaw process and active layer thickness in alpine steppe was more susceptible to warming. Specifically, soil temperature at 540 cm depths increased more in alpine steppe than alpine swamp meadow under warming, especially at topsoil (520 cm). Moreover, the increase in soil temperature at topsoil was greater during cold season than warm season. Greater alterations of soil thermal parameters were likely because soil moisture content reduced more in alpine steppe. Regarding soil freeze-thaw process, warming significantly postponed the onset of completely frozen stage and reduced the completely frozen days in alpine steppe. Active layer thickness in alpine steppe distinctly increased by 46 cm on average and showed an increasing trend under warming from 2009 to 2011. Overall, vegetation coverage and soil moisture content were responsible for the different responses of soil thermodynamics to experimental warming. The study has important implications for future scenarios as permafrost and grassland degradation may intensify under climate warming.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,"114397","excluded",""

We have attempted to determine and classify thermo-freezing regime of the soils for entire Transbaikalia and show the general geographical characteristics of the thermal regime of winterly Transbaikalia. The studies of the 3.2-m thick soil layer were based on the perennial data of 49 meteorological stations.

The entire array of the temperature data was divided into five grades of different widths and represented in the form of vertical profiles. The steps of the scale reflect the progressing increase in winter cooling of the entire soil layer. The weakest soil cooling is observed for the eastern shore of Lake Baikal: These are the moderately cold conditions. In the southern closure of the Barguzin depression, the state of the soil thickness transits smoothly from moderately cold to cold conditions. Very cold soil conditions are propagating from southeast to northwest in the perennial permafrost zone. Severe conditions of soil are present in local regions of the southern part of the territory and its northern part where the sandy-loam soil with pebble admixture allows perennial permafrost to lie at small depths.

Our specific objectives were to determine if: (1) construction of deep pools created channel unit-scale thermal refugia and (2) reach scale stream channel reconfiguration reduced peak water temperatures along a longitudinal continuum known to be highly susceptible to summer-time warming. Contrary to expectations, constructed pools did not significantly decrease channel unit-scale summer water temperatures relative to paired control sites. This suggests that constructed pools did not successfully intercept a cool groundwater source. However, we did find a significant effect of stream channel restoration on reach-scale thermal regimes. Both mean and maximum daily stream temperatures experienced significantly reduced warming trends in restored sections relative to control sections. Furthermore, we found that restoration efforts had the greatest effect on stream temperatures downstream of large tributaries. Restoration appears to have significantly altered thermal regimes within upper Shavers Fork, largely in response to changes in channel morphology that facilitated water movement below major cold-water inputs. Decreased longitudinal warming will likely increase the thermal resiliency of the Shavers Fork main-stem, sustaining the ability of these key large river habitats to continue supporting critical metapopulation processes (e.g. supplemental foraging and dispersal among tributary populations) in the face of climate change.  2019 The Authors.

We assess how increased flow may alter habitat and how that change may impact native and nonnative species using physical habitat modeling and statistical analysis of stream temperature data. We used System for Environmental Flow Analysis to calculate the change in habitat area for both species in the lower 2.1 km of the creek before and after the increased flow. Results indicate a slight increase in available habitat for juveniles of both species and a slight decrease for spawning brown trout. We used regression modeling to relate daily average air temperature to stream temperature and periods of increased discharge during water system maintenance were used to model the temperatures during likely future conditions. Both high and low stream temperature were dampened due to the added water resulting in fewer days with suitable spawning temperature and more days with suitable growth temperature for humpback chub. Fewer suitable days for growth upstream but more suitable days downstream, were predicted for brown trout. Compared to other streams that sustain populations of humpback chub, flow conditions for Bright Angel Creek provide fewer days throughout the year with suitable temperatures, particularly during the winter months. Juvenile humpback chub rearing may improve through the restoration of flow however the presence of predatory brown trout complicates the net beneficial impact.  2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Article","Scopus","6",NA,"selected",""

Changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on-going human-induced climate change, hydrological, regional and structural factors. Here, we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of South Africa. We identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold-water adapted species tolerance to thermal changes. More than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally, with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area. Thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher. Blephariceridae and Notonemouridae, the most thermophobic families, are likely to become locally threatened or extinct, in the absence of connectivity.

Temperature is one of the most important factors influencing hostfungus associations but the effects of temperature variability on disease development are rarely examined. The chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has had severe effects on populations of hundreds of rainforest-endemic amphibian species but we know little about the effects of rainforest-specific host body temperature cycles on infection patterns. To address this challenge, we used body temperature regimes experienced in nature by frogs in the Australian Wet Tropics to guide a controlled experiment investigating the effects of body temperature fluctuations on infection patterns in a model host (Litoria spenceri), with emphasis on exposing frogs to realistic heat pulses that only marginally exceed the thermal optimum of the fungus. We then exposed cultured Bd to an expanded array of heat pulse treatments and measured parameters of population growth to help resolve the role of host immunity in our in vivo results. Infections developed more slowly in frogs exposed to daily 4-hr heat pulses of 26C or 29C than in frogs in constant temperature treatments without heat pulses (control). Frogs that experienced heat pulses were also less likely to exceed infection intensities at which morbidity and mortality become likely. Ten of 11 (91%) frogs from the daily 29C heat pulse treatment even cleared their infections after approximately 9weeks. Cultured Bd also grew more slowly when exposed to heat pulses than in constant-temperature control treatments, suggesting that mild heat pulses have direct negative effects on Bd growth in nature, but precluding us from determining whether there was a concurrent benefit of heat pulses to host immunity. Our results suggest that even in habitats where average temperatures may be suitable for fungal growth and reproduction, infection risk or the outcome of existing infections may be heavily influenced by short but frequent exposures to temperatures that only slightly exceed the optimum for the fungus. Our findings provide support for management interventions that promote warm microenvironments for hosts, such as small-scale removal of branches overhanging critical habitat or provision of artificial heat sources.

In New Zealand, fire activity was rare before human settlement, and New Zealands indigenous woody flora shows little adaptation to frequent fire. One of the few woody indigenous species to show adaptation to frequent fire is Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae), a Plio-Pleistocene immigrant from Australia. Leptospermum scoparium is a widespread early-successional shrub to small tree that frequently dominates post-fire successions, and shows geographically-variable pyriscent serotiny, a fire-adaptation in which seeds are retained in the canopy and open post-fire. Another widespread reproductive adaptation to fire is heat-stimulated germination. Some Australian Leptospermum respond positively to heat treatment, and observations in New Zealand suggest that the seeds of L. scoparium within thick-walled capsules open immediately after fire and successfully germinate, indicating at least no deleterious effect of heating. In some fire-prone systems such as Mediterranean shrublands, traits such as serotiny and heat-stimulated germination have been positively associated with traits associated with flammability (e.g. retention of dead fuel). Here we evaluate the effect of heat stimulation (short exposure to high temperatures) of capsules on germination in L. scoparium from New Zealand, and evaluate links between germination, serotiny and shoot-level flammability. Germination trials using seed collected from 12 populations indicated no consistent positive or negative effect of heat treatment on germination success (germinability). These trials suggest that the capsules of L. scoparium at least provide adequate insulation to heating. Germinability was not consistently related to either serotiny or flammability; nor was it related to latitude or elevation. While taxa from other fire-prone ecosystems may show coordinated trait responses to fire, the lack of association between physical measures of flammability and germination rates indicate that this is not the case in L. scoparium, New Zealands most fire-adapted indigenous woody species.  2017 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

Here, we used comparative functional response analyses to assess how predator-prey interactions between dogfish and invertebrate prey change under different warming scenarios. The Functional Response Type, attack rate, handling time and maximum feeding rate estimates were calculated for Scyliorhinus canicula preying upon Echinogammarus marinus under temperatures of 11.3C and 16.3C, which represent both the potential daily variation and predicted higher summer temperatures within Strangford Lough, N. Ireland. A two x two design of Predator Acclimated, Prey Acclimated, Both Acclimated, and Both Unacclimated was implemented to test functional responses to temperature rise. Attack rate was higher at 11.3C than at 16.3C, but handling time was lower and maximum feeding rates were higher at 16.3C. Non-acclimated predators had similar maximum feeding rate towards non-acclimated and acclimated prey, whereas acclimated predators had significantly higher maximum feeding rates towards acclimated prey as compared to non-acclimated prey. Results suggests that the predator attack rate is decreased by increasing temperature but when both predator and prey are acclimated the shorter handling times considerably increase predator impact. The functional response of the fish changed from Type II to Type III with an increase in temperature, except when only the prey were acclimated. This change from population destabilizing Type II to more stabilizing Type III could confer protection to prey at low densities but increase the maximum feeding rate by Scyliorhinus canicula in the future. However, predator movement between different thermal regimes may maintain a Type II response, albeit with a lower maximum feeding rate. This has implications for the way the increasing population Scyliorhinus canicula in the Irish Sea may exploit valuable fisheries stocks in the future.  2017, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus","10",NA,"selected",""

Its evaluation is therefore critical for selecting appropriate restoration strategies in the post-fire period. This study explores, for the first time, the use of thermogravimetry (TG) as a rapid proxy for nutrient availability and soil recovery. Soil samples from five burned and unburned sites in Andisols of Tenerife (Spain) were selected to examine the medium-term impact of fire. Key soil chemical parameters [pH, electric conductivity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), main cation and anions in the soil solution, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus] were determined and thermogravimetry performed. Burned soils showed significantly higher pH, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and a lower CEC, TOC and TN than the unburned counterparts, and a site-dependent response for soluble SO4 2 and available phosphorus was observed in the medium term. Time elapsed since fire could have masked additional fire impacts. Thermogravimetry data allowed reasonable prediction of most soil properties and parameters, with r2 ranging from 04 to 09. The results demonstrate that soluble nutrient content is directly related to the amount of ash in the soil. The decrease of labile carboxyl-C was associated with an increase of pH and decrease of CEC, whereas the increase of recalcitrant and refractory pools was associated with the amount of TOC and TN. The results suggest that this novel application of an established method can provide, following an initial calibration step, rapid and inexpensive proxies for key parameters necessary for assessing fire-induced ecosystem degradation and designing suitable restoration strategies in the post-fire period.

Their wide latitudinal distribution has been attributed to the occurrence of lineages adapted to distinct thermal niches, but the physiological and molecular bases of this ecotypic differentiation remain largely unknown. By comparing six strains isolated from different latitudes, we showed that the thermostability of their light-harvesting complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), varied according to the average sea surface temperature at strain isolation site. Comparative analyses of thermal unfolding curves of the three phycobiliproteins (PBP) constituting PBS rods suggested that the differences in thermostability observed on whole PBSs relied on the distinct molecular flexibility and stability of their individual components. Phycocyanin was the least thermostable of all rod PBP, constituting a fragility point of the PBS under heat stress. Amino-acid composition analyses and structural homology modeling notably revealed the occurrence of two amino-acid substitutions, which might have a role in the observed differential thermotolerance of this phycobiliprotein among temperature ecotypes. We hypothesize that marine Synechococcus ancestors occurred first in warm niches and that during the colonization of cold, high latitude thermal niches, their descendants have increased the molecular flexibility of PBP to maintain optimal light absorption capacities, this phenomenon likely resulting in a decreased stability of these proteins. This apparent thermoadaptability of marine Synechococcus has most probably contributed to the remarkable ubiquity of these picocyanobacteria in the ocean.  2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

In Northern Norway, anadromous populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) coexist, but in recent years landings of Arctic charr have decreased, while those of Atlantic salmon have been stable or even increased. Here we studied relative abundance, habitat use and growth rate of sympatric stream-living juveniles of both species in Veidnes River, where they are the only fish species present. In 1998/2000, juvenile Arctic charr dominated, especially in the upper and colder part of the river. In 2010, however, Atlantic salmon juveniles were now prominent in all habitat types, whereas nearly all Arctic charr were captured in slow-flowing water near the river bank. Summer air temperature has increased in the region during the last decade. Positive correlations between summer temperatures and back-calculated growth rates were documented in both species, but the growth response was significantly higher in Atlantic salmon. Accordingly, we suggest that juvenile Atlantic salmon may benefit from a warmer climate in northernmost Norway, at the expense of the more cold-water-adapted Arctic charr.  2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

As climate changes, it is projected that changes to the hydrological cycle and water temperatures will affect individual biota and aquatic ecosystems as a whole. The goal of this study was to determine the extent of climate change impacts on stream ecosystems as represented by four commonly used stream health indicators (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), Family Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)). Seven watersheds in Michigan were selected based on stream thermal regimes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate streamflow and pollutant loads. Important variables for each thermal class were selected using a Bayesian variable selection method and used as inputs to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems models of EPT, FIBI, HBI, and IBI. Finally, an ensemble of climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 were used to determine the impacts of climate on the stream health in 2020-2040 compared to 1980-2000. The risk of declining stream health was determined using cumulative distribution functions. A stream temperature regression model was also developed to assess potential changes in stream thermal regimes, which could cause shifts in composition of aquatic communities. Several flow regime variables, including those related to flow variability, duration of extreme events, and timing were mainly affected by changing climate. At the watershed scale, most indicators were relatively insensitive to changing climate and the magnitude of stream health decline was low. However, at the reach scale, there are many instances of high risk and large magnitude of declines in the stream health indicators. At the same time, several streams experienced changes in thermal class, mostly transitioning from cold-transitional and cool streams to warm streams. This research demonstrated the applicability of the stream health modeling process in performing a climate change impacts assessment.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of shrub structure may significantly impact the abiotic environment at the local scale. Our objective was to reconstruct the development of the vertical structure of Betula glandulosa Michx. and to evaluate its effects on winter and summer soil temperature and on snow depth. Stratified sampling of the shrub revealed that shrub biomass distribution followed a similar pattern in stands of contrasting heights. Woody biomass was maximal in the lower stratum and relatively stable in the intermediate strata, while the foliar biomass tracked the vertical development of the shrub structure. Dendrochronological analysis revealed that shrub stands are relatively young; most of the dominant stems started their development after 1990. Shrub height was positively associated with both the dominant stem age and its vertical growth rate. Temperature differences among sites were greater during winter (ca 10 C) than during summer (ca 2 C), while the sum of freezing degree-days varied from 680 C to 2125 C. Shrub height was the most plausible variable explaining snow depth, winter ground level temperature and the sum of freezing degree-days.

In California, mixed conifer forest is often interrupted by stands of shrubs known as montane chaparral. The development of chaparral stands following recent high severity or stand-replacing wildfires in mixed conifer forests has been well documented. Fire has been excluded from mixed conifer forests for over a century, and fuel loads are at historically high levels across much of this landscape. Despite contemporary post-fire research on mixed conifer forest, little is known about montane chaparral fire regimes or forest-chaparral dynamics in an ecosystem with a functioning fire regime. This study quantifies fire regimes in chaparral and adjacent forest and determines how chaparral responded to fire before fire exclusion in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, a park that was never logged. Chaparral stems regenerated immediately after high severity fires in the 19th and early 20th century, and stem recruitment continued until the present. Fire return intervals in chaparral were longer than in adjacent forest (25 years vs. 11 years), and chaparral fires occurred during drier, potentially more extreme conditions. The apparent maintenance of stands of chaparral by less frequent, more severe fires suggests chaparral represents a self-reinforcing alternative stable state to forest. Following fire exclusion, chaparral stands gradually converted to forest as trees progressively invaded chaparral from the forest edge. Forest developing in chaparral is denser and more fir-enriched than the adjacent forest, similar to the understory that develops beneath a pine overstory following fire exclusion. Replacement of chaparral by forest reduces mixed conifer forest landscape diversity. However, the mixture of shrubs and trees in long unburned former chaparral is likely to burn with high severity effects in a subsequent fire. Since chaparral is also establishing in recent, very large high severity burn patches, chaparral extent may be expanding in the new configuration. If the decades needed for trees to invade from forest at the edge of severe burns exceed the fire return interval, chaparral may emerge as an alternative stable state to forest. Consequently, developing management strategies to increase resilience of mixed conifer forests to altered fire regimes is a pressing management challenge.  2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

Here we conduct a high-resolution study on the thermal regime and associated aquatic macroinvertebrate community downstream of a hydroelectric dam on a large-order Northern Great Plains River and analyze these findings with a non-central hypothesis test model, Test Site Analysis. Specifically, we monitor the temperature regime of this tailwater environment, and compare the annual change in temperature downstream to reference sites unaffected by the dam. We find that reaches downstream of the dam are significantly cooler than reference through the summer into August and do not reach the temperature optima of reference reaches. Cold-water release, or some other change in flow characteristics, changes abundance, diversity, % Orthocladiinae, and community composition. We used these metrics to compare test sites to reference sites and to quantify the impact of the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir on community metrics characteristic of temperature stress.

Continued resource exploration in this environment has created a need to better understand the processes causing permafrost thaw and concomitant changes to the terrain and ground cover, in order to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of future exploration through the development of best management practices. In a peatland 50 km south of Fort Simpson, NWT, permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence have produced water-logged linear disturbances that appear not to be regenerating permafrost, and in many cases have altered the land cover type to resemble that of a wetland bog or fen. Subsidence alters the hydrology of plateaus, developing a fill and spill drainage pattern that allows some disturbances to be hydrologically connected with adjacent wetlands via surface flow paths during periods of high water availability. The degree of initial disturbance is an important control on the extent of permafrost thaw and thus the overall potential recovery of the linear disturbance. Low impact techniques that minimize ground surface disturbance and maintain original surface topography by eliminating windrows are needed to minimize the impact of these linear disturbances.  2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus","2","025006","excluded",""

Through model simulations we evaluate the cooling effects of mature riparian vegetation corridors along the streams and potential increases due to global warming for the 2020s-2080s time horizons. Site potential shade influences are smaller in the mainstream due to its relatively large size and reduced canopy density in the lower reaches, proving a modest reduction of about 0.3C of the stream length average daily maximum temperature, compared with 1.5C and 2.8C in Icicle and Nason Creeks. Assuming no changes in riparian vegetation shade, stream length-average daily maximum temperature could increase in the Wenatchee River from 1-1.2C by the 2020s to 2C in the 2040s and 2.5-3.6C in the 2080s, reaching 27-30C in the warmest reaches. The cooling effects from the site potential riparian vegetation are likely to be offset by the climate change effects in the Wenatchee River by the 2020s. Buffers of mature riparian vegetation along the banks of the tributaries could prevent additional water temperature increases associated with climate change. By the end of the century, assuming site potential shade, the tributaries could have a thermal condition similar to today's condition which has less shade. In the absence of riparian vegetation restoration, at typical summer low flows, stream length average daily mean temperatures could reach about 16.4-17C by the 2040s with stream length average daily maxima around 19.5-20.6C, values that can impair or eliminate salmonid rearing and spawning. Modeled increases in stream temperature due to global warming are determined primarily by the projected reductions in summer streamflows, and to a lesser extent by the increases in air temperature.

Because predation can shape patterns of abundance and diversity across a community, it is critical to understand the effect of temperature on predator behavior. Climate change in intertidal systems will comprise changes in both air and water temperatures, yet most previous marine intertidal studies have focused on either air or water temperature alone. In a 20 d laboratory study, we examined the effect of changing emersed and submersed body temperatures on the feeding and growth rates of Nucella ostrina, a common northeastern Pacific intertidal gastropod that feeds primarily on the barnacle Balanus glandula. Our results revealed a large increase in both predation and growth rates with higher submersion temperatures (13.5C compared with 11C). In contrast, we observed a large decrease in the feeding and growth of N. ostrina exposed to the highest emersed body temperature (28C) when compared with intermediate (20C) and cooler (12C) aerial temperatures. Thus, while B. glandula may suffer greater predation-related mortality in warmer water temperatures, it may actually experience a release from predation if air temperatures warm. Our study points to the importance of considering temperatures reached during both submersion and emersion separately, and examining behavioral responses in light of physiologically relevant temperatures and thermal regimes.  2009 Inter-Research.","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

A case of a Nile River reach was studied to investigate the impact of the existence of the Esna barrage on the water quality and fish in its upstream reach. The barrage has negative impacts on the upstream self-assimilative capacity of the rivers.

We used a novel approach, which combined use of the West Virginia Stream Condition Index (WVSCI) to quantify ecological losses and community similarity analysis to assign specific levels of ecological loss to AMD, thermal effluent, and their interaction. Finally, we developed an ecological currency to quantify the relative benefits of a restoration program that focused either on AMD remediation or heat reduction and to identify spatially explicit restoration priorities. Variation in ecological condition was strongly correlated to variation in water quality when AMD and heat stress occurred in isolation. Acute inputs of AMD or heat caused predictable reductions in condition followed by rapid recovery downstream. However, benthic communities failed to recover from combined inputs of heat and AMD even when these stressors occurred at relatively low levels. Over the course of an entire year, AMD alone was over two times more responsible than heat alone for ecological loss. Consequently, AMD is the dominant factor limiting ecological condition and should be the primary target for restoration. Nevertheless, an AMD  heat interaction also was responsible for extensive ecological loss in lower reaches of the river. Consequently, full restoration of the lower Cheat River mainstem will require an approach that integrates AMD remediation with effective management of thermal effluent. Our results provide some of the first field evidence of the interactive effects of multiple stressors on biological communities in a mined watershed.

Therefore, methods are needed for measuring stream shade in practical riparian management. The quantity 'diffuse non-interceptance' (difn), defined as the proportion of incident lighting received under a sky of uniform brightness and best estimated from fish-eye images, is useful for general specification of light exposure. For routine measurement of difn along stream reaches we recommend using a matched pair of simple light sensors (e.g. photosynthetically available radiation sensors) under conditions of complete overcast (which has almost uniform brightness). Methods are also needed for predicting future light exposure as riparian plantings grow and increasingly shade the stream.

Water temperature associated with multiple mainstem hydropower facilities might be one of many factors responsible for depressing Klamath salmon stocks. We combined a water quantity model and a water quality model to predict how removing the series of dams below Upper Klamath Lake might affect water temperatures, and ultimately fish survival, in the spawning and rearing portions of the mainstem Klamath. We calibrated the water quantity and quality models and applied them for the hydrometeorological conditions during a 40-year postdam period. Then, we hypothetically removed the dams and their impoundments from the models and reestimated the river's water temperatures. The principal thermal effect of dam and reservoir removal would be to restore the timing (phase) of the river's seasonal thermal signature by shifting it approximately 18 days earlier in the year, resulting in river temperatures that more rapidly track ambient air temperatures. Such a shift would likely cool thermal habitat conditions for adult fall chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) during upstream migration and benefit mainstem spawning. By contrast spring and early summer temperatures could be warmer without dams, potentially harming chinook rearing and outmigration in the mainstem. Dam removal might affect the river's thermal regime during certain conditions for over 200 km of the mainstem.  2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Article","Scopus","6",NA,"excluded",""

Its artificial origin and the climate make it a very dynamic environment, strongly characterised by very wide water-level fluctuations. These vertical water movements interfere with the thermal stability of the water body often causing the breaking of the thermocline in mid-summer. In addition, the summer level-decrease influences the nutrient dynamics and modifies the zmix/zeu ratio. All these modifications were observed to support a high environmental variability, which was reflected by the richness of its phytoplankton composition and by its dynamics. Nevertheless, an investigation carried out from March 2001 to March 2002 showed that the assemblage was strongly dominated by a few species, one by one. In particular, two different Microcystis morphotypes dominated the assemblage from mid-April till the beginning of October. The prolonged dominance of these 'species' should suggest that a steady state condition took place in Lake Arancio during spring and summer 2001. This is in contrast with previous investigations, which showed high diversity values especially occurring in the period of strong environmental instability when the continuous dewatering caused the breaking of the thermocline in the middle of summer. Nevertheless, this dominant species showed a very wide morphological variability and alternated among 'more S', 'S', and 'R' (sensu Reynolds) ecotypes. The ever-changing morphological features suggest a different ecological behaviour of the species involved. They seem to confirm that the environmental variability of Mediterranean reservoirs sustains high diversity values, even though this diversity has to be sought in the amplitude of morphological plasticity of one or a few species, rather than in the coexistence of a variety of species.","Conference Paper","Scopus",NA,NA,"excluded",""

The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that the effects of these thermal and dietary conditions were distinctly different for prey and predators, which suggests that such conditions would promote developmental asynchrony between prey and predator populations.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

We examined the effects of three tomato allelochemicals (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21:10C and 26:15C, representing spring and summer respectively) on three insect herbivores: a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sexta, and the polyphagous Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera exigua. The alkaloid tomatine slowed development of the polyphagous H. zea, but the two phenolics had little effect. Development of the polyphagous S. exigua was faster with tomatine at the cool thermal regime, and slower with the two phenolics together at the warm thermal regime. All three of the tomato allelochemicals slowed development of the specialist M. sexta. Values of approximate digestibility (or assimilation efficiency) for the two polyphagous species spanned a range twice that of the Solanaceae specialist, increasing when allelochemicals were added to diet. Our techniques permitted us to separate pre- and post-ingestive effects of allelochemicals on mass gained, but we found complex interaction of allelochemicals and of temperature and allelochemicals. The effects of an allelochemical on larval performance often depended on the combination of other allelochemicals in the diet. But the allelochemicals did not always have a negative effect, and multiple allelochemicals did not always have a more negative effect than a single allelochemical. Interaction between thermal regime and the allelochemicals was also common. For example, whether rutin had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on relative growth rate of S. exigua depended on thermal regime and presence or absence of chlorogenic acid. Often the negative effect of an allelochemical was greater at the warm regime than at the cool regime, but not consistently so. Another experiment showed that thermal regime did not affect allelochemical concentration in the diets. Over time (7 d), only tomatine concentration declined. Therefore, the interactive effects of thermal regime and allelochemicals on the insect herbivores were not an artifact of the experimental procedures. Overall, the results indicated that insect performance is not a simple function of temperature and food quality because interactions occur between these factors. They also suggest that the array of chemical defenses exhibited by a particular plant species may be shaped in part by temperature altering the efficacy of allelochemicals.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

The primary factors (hydrology, climate, insolation) that interact to determine the thermal rgime are examined in the context of southern waters. Maximum temperatures are plotted against annual ranges for equatorial (0-10 latitude), tropical (10-231/2 latitude), and temperate sites. In regions with seasonal climates, running waters exhibit diel and annual thermal periodicity patterns, the phasing of which varies between and within lotic systems. The universality of Illies' river zonation system is analyzed in the context of thermal conditions in Southern Hemisphere running waters. From the relatively limited data base, it appears that Southern Hemisphere running waters exhibit some distinctive features when viewed in toto, compared with Europe and North America where thermal characteristics of lotic habitats have been reasonably well documented. Such differences relate to the generally warm and dry conditions, and to the highly variable and unpredictable climatic rgimes characterizing large areas of the Southern Hemisphere. It is concluded that differences in thermal conditions of running waters between hemispheres are a matter of degree rather than of kind, and partly reflect a small woodland stream bias inherent in Northern Hemisphere stream ecology.  1985 Dr W.

Scleractinian corals living near their thermal optimums are increasingly vulnerable to bleaching and mortality as oceanic heat waves increase globally. Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) below 30m depths are characteristically cooler than adjacent shallow water reefs, which according to theory should result in differential metabolic responses to temperature between depths. How local temperatures influence physiological responses in mesophotic corals is poorly understood. We compared thermal sensitivities of four coral species between a shallow (510m) and upper-mesophotic (3035m) reef in Bermuda. Thermal performance curves (TPC) were measured in laboratory mesocosms for four common coral species (Diploria labyrinthiformis, Orbicella franksi, Montastraea cavernosa andPorites astreoides) across a wide range of temperatures (1936). Our results indicate that the maximum rate of gross photosynthetic (GP) performance (GP-Pmax) and the mean overall photosynthetic rates (GP-lnc) varied significantly among species. In contrast, thermal sensitivity (Pmax, Topt, lnc, E, Eh, or Th) did not vary between depths for conspecifics except for deactivation energy (GP-Eh) in D. labyrinthiformis. Additionally, gross respiration (R) did not differ among species or between depths for any thermal metric. Similar metabolic responses between depths suggest that local adaptation and/or acclimatization to different thermal conditions is likely not occurring. Instead, upper-mesophotic corals in Bermuda do not have lower bleaching thresholds than shallow water conspecifics, but similar thermal sensitivities supporting the potential for MCEs to function as a thermal refuge.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of warming and land-based inputs (e.g. sedimentation and nutrient loading) on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we measured how a natural nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets of coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host response variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent cover of Pocillopora acuta colonies in Moorea, French Polynesia. We used thermal performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates and temperature along the environmental gradient. We found that algal endosymbiont percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while endosymbiont nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely representing competition among the algal endosymbionts. Nutrient and sediment loading decreased coral metabolic responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal optimum for dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal performance for gross photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic and calcification rates normalized to a reference temperature (26.8C) decreased along the gradient. Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta colonies decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude along the nutrient gradient. These findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple levels of coral functionality.

Indeed, invasive species, by definition, have succeeded in areas outside of their native range and may therefore have higher adaptive capacity relative to native species. Nevertheless, the genetic architecture of the thermal niche, which sets a limit to the potential for populations to evolve rapidly under climate change, has never been measured in an invasive species in its introduced range. Here, we estimate the genetic architecture of thermal performance in the harlequin beetle (Harmonia axyridis), a Central Asian species that has invaded four continents. We measured thermal performance curves in more than 400 third-generation offspring from a paternal half-sib breeding experiment and analyzed the genetic variancecovariance matrix. We show that while the critical thermal limits in this species have an additive genetic basis, most components of the thermal performance curve have low heritability. Moreover, we found evidence that genetic correlations may constrain the evolution of beetles under climate change.

We describe here a new robust and versatile experimental framework for the accurate investigation of thermal performance and phenotypic diversity in yeasts and yeast-like microorganisms, at the individual and population levels. In addition to proof-of-concept, the application of this framework to the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici resulted in detailed characterisations for this yeast-like microorganism of (i) the patterns of temperature-dependent changes in performance for four fitness traits; (ii) the consistency in thermal sensitivity rankings of strains between in planta and in vitro growth assessments; (iii) significant interindividual variation in thermal responses, with four principal thermotypes detected in a sample of 66 strains; and (iv) the ecological consequences of this diversity for population-level processes through pairwise competition experiments highlighting temperature-dependent outcomes. These findings extend our knowledge and ability to quantify and categorise the phenotypic heterogeneity of thermal responses.

We examined the influence of body temperature (13, 18, 23, and 28 C) and individual identity on spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, over three consecutive weeks. Locomotor activity was characterized by four parameters: distance covered, mean velocity, frequency of movements, and total activity rate (all directional and non-directional movements). Apart from total activity rate, thermal reaction norms for locomotor parameters had convex or concave curvilinear shapes. During the first trial series, i.e. across the four body temperatures that were tested, individual identity explained less variation in thermal reaction norms than during the second series. Individual means, i.e. the vertical positions of individual thermal reaction norms, were repeatable between trial series in all locomotor activity parameters but the frequency of movements. We conclude that spontaneous locomotor activity is a complex trait, which can be characterized by several parameters with varying individual repeatability and thermal dependency.

Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits. This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature range of up to 20C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic (brown) and aposymbiotic (white) states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (1832C) and cold (186C) stress, during which respiration of the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26C. Additionally, thermal optimum (Topt) analyses show a 3.8C (brown) and 6.9C (white) higher Topt in the VA population, corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis rates or Fv/Fm, suggesting a possible host-only signature of adaptation.

Thus, understanding how species cope with contrasting climates may inform us about their potential for thermal adaptation and which processes may hamper that ability (e.g. evolutionary trade-offs, phenology or behavioural thermoregulation). In addition to temperature, time constraints may also exert important selective pressures. Here, we compare the thermal sensitivity of locomotion of metamorphic and adult European common frogs (Rana temporaria) originating from populations along an elevational gradient. We employed the template mode of variation (TMV) analysis to decompose the thermal sensitivity of locomotion and explore the existence of trade-offs (hotter is better and specialistgeneralist) and the degree of local adaptation. To that end, we studied the relationship between TMV parameters and local environmental conditions. Further, we compared preferred temperatures to assess whether behavioural thermoregulation could dampen the effects of thermal variation, reducing the intensity of selection and limiting thermal adaptation (i.e. Bogert effect). We suggest that behavioural thermoregulation has promoted the conservatism of thermal sensitivity in R.temporaria. Yet, we observed a trend towards narrower thermal niches shifted towards warmer temperature in populations with severe temporal constraints, conforming to the generalist-specialist trade-off. Apparently, this enables time-constrained populations  especially in the case of metamorphs  to effectively exploit resources during the warmest periods. The limited potential of R.temporaria for thermal adaptation suggests that forecasts of global warming should incorporate thermoregulation and explore its potential to buffer species from rising temperatures.  2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Habitat warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has detrimentally impacted marine primary production, with the effects observed on regional and global scales. In contrast to slower-growing higher plants, there is considerable potential for phytoplankton to evolve rapidly with changing environmental conditions. The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood, but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here, we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote, Amphidinium massartii (dinoflagellate). Most notably, the population became high-temperature specialized (higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum), and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently, the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition (i.e., an increase in fatty acid saturation), the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear, and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton.  2018 Phycological Society of America","Article","Scopus","6",NA,"selected",""

This variation can be interrupted when biogeographic breaks occur across the range of a species, which are known to affect patterns of community structure, abundance and recruitment dynamics. Coastal biogeographic breaks often impose abrupt changes in environmental characteristics driven by oceanographic processes and can affect the physiological responses of populations inhabiting these areas. Here, we examined thermal limits, performances for heart rate and plasticity in metabolic rate of the intertidal shrimp Betaeus emarginatus from seven populations along its latitudinal range (~3000 km). The distribution of this species encompass two breaks along the southeastern Pacific coast of Chile: the northern break is characterized by sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes, and the southern break constitutes a major discontinuity in water conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients), coastline topography and divergence of main oceanographic currents. For B. emarginatus, we found higher plasticity in metabolism at the sites sampled at the biogeographic breaks, and at the site subjected to seasonal upwelling. The variation in metabolic ratewas not consistent with increasing latitude and it was not affected by breaks. The lower and upper thermal limits were lower in populations around breaks, although the optimum temperature decreased towards higher latitudes. Overall, whereas thermal limits and plasticity of metabolism are related to biogeographic breaks, metabolic rate is not related to increasing latitude or the presence of breaks in the sampled range.  2018.

For tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), the last surviving member of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia and an unusually cold-tolerant reptile, we aimed to clarify responses in indices of metabolic rate (oxygen consumption [VO2] and carbon dioxide production [VCO2]) as well as rates of total evaporative water loss (TEWL) to temperatures at the warmer end of the known tolerated range; currently, patterns for metabolic rate are unclear above 25C, and TEWL has not been measured above 25C. We first established that metabolic rate was lowest during the photophase and thenmeasuredVO2,VCO2, and TEWL at six temperatures (12, 20, 24, 27, 29, and 30C) during this phase. Consistent with our predictions, we found that mass-adjusted VO2, VCO2, and TEWL increased at least 3.5- fold between 127 and 30C (at 30C, rates were 2.509 mL g-1 h-1, 2.001 mL g-1 h-1, and 1.829 mg-1 g-1 h-1, respectively).

Each sex may benefit from possessing different thermal performance capacities that would allow them to maximise their fitness relative to their different reproductive roles; especially when performances are closely related to reproductive success. Here, we examine sexual divergence in thermal sensitivities of performance across three populations of the Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) over an extensive latitudinal cline. Using analyses of the thermal sensitivity of routine activity, bite force and sprint speed, we explored whether: (i) males and females differed in their optimal temperatures for performance, (ii) the sexes differed in their thermal sensitivities of performance, and (iii) the degree of sexual divergence in thermal sensitivity varied among the populations. Because male H. frenatus are highly aggressive and frequently engage in combat to gain territories and mating opportunities, we expected males would be active over a wider range of temperatures than females and this would favour broad thermal sensitivity curves for males. In addition, we expected a greater divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the temperate populations that experience greater daily and seasonal thermal variation. We found that males were more active, and had greater bite forces and faster sprint speeds than females, independent of body size. In addition, we found differences between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the tropical population; female H. frenatus were less active and possessed lower sprint speeds at higher temperatures than males. Although H. frenatus from the most variable thermal environments also displayed the broadest thermal performance range, it was the more stable tropical population that exhibited the greatest divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivity of performance. The divergence in thermal physiology that we detected between the sexes of H. frenatus is consistent with the idea that males will derive mating and territorial advantages for maintaining function over a broader range of temperatures.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus","4",NA,"selected",""

We raised offspring from these populations in a laboratory common garden and compared the shape of their thermal performance curves to test for genetic divergence in thermal physiology. Thermal performance curves differed between populations in a common garden in ways partially consistent with divergent patterns of natural selection experienced by the source populations, implying that they had evolved in response to selection. Next, we estimated the heritability of thermal performance curves and of several traits related to thermoregulatory behaviour. We did not detect significant heritability in most components of the thermal performance curve or in several aspects of thermoregulatory behaviour, suggesting that contemporary selection is unlikely to result in rapid evolution. Our results indicate that the response to selection may be slow in the brown anole and that evolutionary change is unlikely to keep pace with current rates of environmental change.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Individuals attempting to optimize fitness must thus select appropriate temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that To for traits closely linked to fitness should match temperatures selected by a species (Tset) and should coevolve with Tset. To may mismatch Tset if the thermal reaction norm for fitness is asymmetric. In this study, we examined six traits related to fitness in red and in confused flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum, respectively), including longevity, lifetime reproductive success, reproductive rate, and development time at four temperatures between 23 and 32C. For reproductive traits, To matched Tset whereas for longevity To was lower than Tset. Tribolium species have a strongly r-selected life history strategy, therefore reproductive traits are likely more tightly linked to fitness than longevity due to high predation rates at early life stages. We therefore provide support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis for reproductive traits that are tightly linked to fitness.

We exposed Drosophila melanogaster to 10 developmental temperatures covering their entire permissible temperature range. We obtained metabolic profiles and reaction norms for several functional traits: egg-to-adult viability, developmental time, and heat and cold tolerance. Females were more heat tolerant than males, whereas no sexual dimorphism was found in cold tolerance. A group of metabolites, mainly free amino acids, had linear reaction norms. Several energy-carrying molecules, as well as some sugars, showed distinct inverted U-shaped norms of reaction across the thermal range, resulting in a positive correlation between metabolite intensities and egg-to-adult viability. At extreme temperatures, low levels of these metabolites were interpreted as a response characteristic of costs of homeostatic perturbations. Our results provide novel insights into a range of metabolites reported to be central for the acclimation response and suggest several new candidate metabolites. Low and high temperatures result in different adaptive physiological responses, but they also have commonalities likely to be a result of the failure to compensate for the physiological stress.

We used microsatellite markers to estimate gene flow among islands and then examined the correlation between thermal performance and island temperature. The thermal optimum for sprint performance was correlated with both mean and maximum island temperature, whereas performance breadth was not correlated with any measure of temperature variation. Gene flow between islands decreased as the difference between mean island temperatures increased, even when those islands were adjacent to one another.

Cold acclimation decreased the critical thermal minimum from 0.50.25 to 2.10.18C, and chill coma recovery time after 72h at 2C from 16.84.9 to 5.22.0min. Measures of both potential and realised immunity followed a typical thermal performance curve, decreasing with decreasing temperature.

As temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly declines at higher temperatures - a response that can be described using a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is often attributed to the competing effects of thermodynamics, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and the effects of temperature on protein stability, this account represents an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level of single proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account for the effects of temperature on complex multistep processes, such as aerobic metabolism, that rely on mechanisms acting across multiple levels of biological organization. The purpose of this review is to explore our current understanding of the factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism in response to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas where this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these TPCs are the foundation of several recent attempts to predict the responses of species to climate change, including the metabolic theory of ecology and the hypothesis of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance.  2015.

For 'normal' body temperatures - benign temperatures near the species' mean - thermal biology traditionally uses performance curves to describe how physiological capabilities vary with temperature. However, these curves, which are typically measured under static laboratory conditions, can yield incomplete or inaccurate predictions of how organisms respond to natural patterns of temperature variation. For example, scale transition theory predicts that, in a variable environment, peak average performance is lower and occurs at a lower mean temperature than the peak of statically measured performance.We also demonstrate that temporal variation in performance is minimized near this new 'optimal' temperature. These factors add complexity to predictions of the consequences of climate change. We then move beyond the performance curve approach to consider the effects of rare, extreme temperatures. A statistical procedure (the environmental bootstrap) allows for longterm simulations that capture the temporal pattern of extremes (a Poisson interval distribution), which is characterized by clusters of events interspersed with long intervals of benign conditions. The bootstrap can be combined with biophysical models to incorporate temporal, spatial and physiological variation into evolutionary models of thermal tolerance. We conclude with several challenges that must be overcome to more fully develop our understanding of thermal performance in the context of a changing climate by explicitly considering different forms of small-scale variation. These challenges highlight the need to empirically and rigorously test existing theories.  2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","Review","Scopus","12",NA,"selected",""

To address this, we took a multivariate approach, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for locomotor activity TPCs in the fly, Drosophila serrata, using a panel of 76 recombinant inbred lines. The distribution of additive genetic (co)variance in the mapping population was remarkably similar to the distribution of mutational (co)variance for these traits. We detected 11 TPC QTL in females and 4 in males. Multivariate QTL effects were closely aligned with the major axes genetic (co)variation between temperatures; most QTL effects corresponded to variation for either overall increases or decreases in activity with a smaller number indicating possible trade-offs between activity at high and low temperatures. QTL representing changes in curve shape such as the 'generalist-specialist' trade-off, thought key to thermal adaptation, were poorly represented in the data.

This study determined how embryonic temperature (TE) affects development and the activity of metabolic enzymes in the swimming muscle of zebrafish. Embryos developed successfully to hatching (survival 88%) from 22 to 32C, but suffered sharp increases in mortality outside of this range. Embryos that were incubaTEd until hatching at a control TE (27C) or near the extremes for successful development (22 or 32C) were next raised to adulthood under control conditions at 27C. Growth trajectories afTEr hatching were alTEred in the 22C and 32C TE groups compared with 27C TE controls, but growth slowed afTEr 3 months of age in all groups. Maximal enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citraTE synthase (CS), hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvaTE kinase (PK) and lactaTE dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured across a range of assay TEmperatures (22, 27, 32 and 36C) in adults from each TE group that were acclimaTEd to 27 or 32C. SubstraTE affinities (Km) were also deTErmined for COX and LDH. In adult fish acclimaTEd to 27C, COX and PK activities were higher in 22C and 32C TE groups than in 27C TE controls, and the TEmperature optimum for COX activity was higher in the 32C TE group than in the 22C TE group. Warm acclimation reduced COX, CS and/or PK activities in the 22 and 32C TE groups, possibly to compensaTE for thermal effects on molecular activity. This response did not occur in the 27C TE controls, which insTEad increased LDH and HOAD activities. Warm acclimation also increased thermal sensitivity (Q10) of HOAD to cool TEmperatures across all TE groups.

However, little attention has been paid to the joint expression of plasticity and bet hedging. Here, I examine the simultaneous expression of plasticity in germination rate and two potential bet-hedging traits - germination fraction and within-season diversification in timing of germination - in seeds from multiple seed families of five geographically distant populations of Lobelia inflata (L.) subjected to a thermal gradient. Populations differ in germination plasticity to temperature, in total germination fraction and in the expression of potential diversification in the timing of germination. The observation of a negative partial correlation between the expression of plasticity and germination variance (potential diversification), and a positive correlation between plasticity and germination fraction is suggestive of a trade-off between modes of response to environmental variance. If the observed correlations are indicative of those between adaptive plasticity and bet hedging, we expect an optimal balance to exist and differ among populations.

To address this disconnect, we combined thermal performance curves for five populations of Anolis lizard from the Bay Islands of Honduras with high-resolution temperature distributions generated from physical models. Previous research has suggested that open-habitat species are likely to invade forest habitat and drive forest species to extinction. We test this hypothesis, and compare the vulnerabilities of closely related, but allopatric, forest species. Our data suggest that the open-habitat populations we studied will not invade forest habitat and may actually benefit from predicted warming for many decades. Conversely, one of the forest species we studied should experience reduced activity time as a result of warming, while two others are unlikely to experience a significant decline in performance.

Specifically, we investigated temperature-related variation in two innate immune performance metrics, hemagglutination and hemolysis, for 13 species across all seven major vertebrate clades. Agglutination and lysis were temperature dependent and were more strongly related to the thermal biology of species (e.g., mean Tbody) than to the phylogenetic relatedness of species, although these relationships were complex and frequently surprising (e.g., heterotherms did not exhibit broader thermal performance curves than homeotherms). Agglutination and lysis performance were positively correlated within species, except in taxa that produce squalamine, a steroidal antibiotic that does not lyse red blood cells. Interestingly, we found the antithesis of a generalist-specialist trade-off: species with broader temperature ranges of immune performance also had higher peak performance levels.

It requires characterization of the leaf temperature for foliar fungal pathogens. Epidemiologists, however, use air temperature to assess the impacts of temperature on such pathogens. Leaf temperature can differ greatly from air temperature, either in controlled or field conditions. This leads to a misunderstanding of such impacts. Experiments were carried out in controlled conditions on adult wheat plants to characterize the response of Mycosphaerella graminicola to a wide range of leaf temperatures. Three fungal isolates were used. Lesion development was assessed twice a week, whereas the temperature of each leaf was monitored continuously. Leaf temperature had an impact on disease dynamics.

The establishment of thermal performance curves demonstrated differences among isolates as well as among leaf layers.

We examined the interaction between correlated (seasonally matching) and conflicting (seasonally opposite) temperature and photoperiod cues on the acclimation of performance traits in malezebrafish, Danio rerio. We acclimated fish for 8 weeks and then tested the change in thermal dependence of maximum burst swimming and feeding rate between 8 and 38C. We predicted that correlated environmental cues shouldinduce a greater acclimation response than uncorrelated cues. However, we found that only temperature was important for the seasonal acclimation of performance traits in zebrafish. Thermal acclimation shifted the thermal performance curve of both traits. For maximum burst swimming, performance increased for each group near the acclimation temperature and reduced in environments that were far from their acclimation temperature. The feeding rate ofcold-acclimated zebrafish was reduced across the test temperature range compared with that of warm-acclimated fish.

Recent experiments in lab-reared vertebrates have shown that changes in environmental temperature can induce shifts in the gut microbiota, and in some cases these shifts have been shown to affect host thermal physiology. However, there is a lack of information about the effects of temperature on the gut microbiota of wild-caught vertebrates. Moreover, in ectotherms, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperature regimens, the extent to which microbiota composition is shaped by temperature and associated with host thermal tolerance has not been investigated. To address these issues, we monitored the gut microbiota composition of wildcaught western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) experimentally exposed to a cool-to-warm temperature transition. Comparing experimentally exposed and control lizards indicated that warm temperatures altered and destabilized the composition of the S. occidentalis gut microbiota. Warming drove a significant reduction in the relative abundances of a clade of Firmicutes, a significant increase in the rate of compositional turnover in the gut microbiota within individual lizards, and increases in the abundances of bacteria from predicted pathogenic clades. In addition, the composition of the microbiota was significantly associated with the thermal tolerance of lizards measured at the end of the experiment.

Prolonged cold exposure induces chill injuries that can be mitigated if the cold period is interrupted with short warming intervals, referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes (FTR). In this study, we tested how to optimally use FTR to extend the shelf life of D. suzukii under cold storage. Several FTR parameters were assessed: temperature (15, 20, 25 C), duration (0.5, 1, 2, 3 h), and frequency (every 12, 24, 36, 48 h) of warming intervals, in two wild-type lines and in two developmental stages (pupae and adults). Generally, FTR improved cold storage tolerance with respect to constant low temperatures (CLT). Cold mortality was lower when recovery temperature was 20 C or higher, when duration was 2 h per day or longer, and when warming interruptions occurred frequently (every 12 or 24 h). Applying an optimized FTR protocol to adults greatly reduced cold mortality over long-term storage (up to 130 d). Consequences of FTR on fitness-related traits were also investigated. For adults, poststorage survival was unaffected by FTR, as was the case for female fecundity and male mating capacity. On the other hand, when cold storage occurred at pupal stage, poststorage survival and male mating capacity were altered under CLT, but not under FTR. After storage of pupae, female fecundity was lower under FTR compared to CLT, suggesting an energy trade-off between repair of chill damages and egg production.

Rates and trajectories of embryonic development are highly sensitive to temperature, favouring an ability of embryos to respond adaptively (i.e. match their developmental biology to local thermal regimes). Spatially, thermal variation can be significant within a single nest (top to bottom), among adjacent nests (as a function of shading, nest depth etc.), across populations that inhabit areas with different weather conditions, and across species that differ in climates occupied and/or nest characteristics. Thermal regimes also vary temporally, in ways that generate differences among nests within a single population (e.g. due to seasonal timing of laying), among populations and across species.Anthropogenic activities (e.g. habitat clearing, climate change) add to this spatial and temporal diversity in thermal regimes. We review published literature on embryonic adaptations to spatio-temporal heterogeneity in nest temperatures. Although relatively few taxa have been studied in detail, and proximate mechanisms remain unclear, our review identifies many cases in which natural selection appears to have fine-tuned embryogenesis to match local thermal regimes. Developmental rates have been reported to differ between uppermost versus lower eggs within a single nest, between eggs laid early versus late in the season, and between populations from cooler versus warmer climates.

The present study aimed to investigate the presence and the localization of HSP70 through the development of Podarcis siculus, an oviparous lizard inhabiting temperate Mediterranean regions, showing a limited potential to tolerate thermal changes during embryogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that HSP70 protein is constitutively present in early embryonic stages, abundantly distributed in eye, in encephalic domains (predominantly in ventricular areas and in grey matter), in grey matter of spinal cord, in lung, gut mucosa, hepatic cords and kidney tubules. Interestingly, a severe drop in incubation temperature (5 C for 3 days) does not induce enhancements in HSP70 levels nor changes in tissues localization.

Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana  including development, pupal mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits expressed against parasitoids  to this experimental imitation of global warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for larval escape ability to natural enemies (+60%). Conversely, warming elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves (26%) and immunity (total phenoloxidase activity: 34%). These findings confirm that traits should differ in their sensitivity to global warming, underlying complex consequences for population dynamics and trophic interactions. Our study strengthens the importance of combining a multi-trait approach with the use of realistic fluctuating regimes to forecast the consequences of global warming for individuals, species and species assemblages.  2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,"103916","selected",""

Experiments typically employ either an abrupt transfer to near-lethal temperatures or a gradually increasing thermal exposure. In the current study, we used three populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus that are known to differ in upper thermal tolerance to investigate the effects of gradual versus abrupt thermal exposures on survivorship, developmental time, and heat shock protein gene expression. The developmental rate of nauplii was unaffected following the gradual exposure, whereas developmental time slowed by 2 d (20%) following an abrupt exposure. The gradual exposure also improved survivorship in comparison to the abrupt exposure. Furthermore, the heat shock protein genes hsp70 and hspb1 showed greater upregulation during the gradual thermal exposure compared to the abrupt exposure. Though the differences in response to each thermal regime varied in magnitude among the different populations, the types of responses were very similar (i.e., following the gradual exposure survivorship increased, developmental time showed no effect, and heat shock protein gene upregulation during the exposure increased). Therefore, the enhanced protective effect of the heat shock response during gradual exposures appears to be conserved within the species despite population-level differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, an ecologically relevant thermal exposure likely enables improved cellular protective mechanisms by allowing for an effective and timely heat shock response, which plays a role in mitigating the effects of thermal stress and thereby enhances tolerance to elevated temperatures.  2019 by The University of Chicago.

However, very little is known about how thermal variation caused by urbanization influences the ability of organisms to live in cities. Ectotherms are sensitive to environmental changes that affect thermal conditions, and therefore, increased urban temperatures may pose significant challenges to thermoregulation and alter temperature-dependent activity. To evaluate whether these changes to the thermal environment affect the persistence and dispersal of ectothermic species in urban areas, we studied two species of Anolis lizards (Anolis cristatellus and Anolis sagrei) introduced to Miami-Dade County, FL, USA, where they occur in both urban and natural habitats. We calculated canopy openness and measured operative temperature (T e ), which estimates the distribution of body temperatures in a non-thermoregulating population, in four urban and four natural sites. We also captured lizards throughout the day and recorded their internal body temperature (T b ). We found that urban areas had more open canopies and higher T e compared to natural habitats. Laboratory trials showed that A.cristatellus preferred lower temperatures than A.sagrei. Urban sites currently occupied by each species appear to lower thermoregulatory costs for both species, but only A.sagreihad field T b that were more often within their preferred temperature range in urban habitats compared to natural areas. Furthermore, based on available T e within each species' preferred temperature range, urban sites with only A.sagrei appear less suitable for A.cristatellus, whereas natural sites with only A.cristatellus are less suitable for A.sagrei. These results highlight how the thermal properties of urban areas contribute to patterns of persistence and dispersal, particularly relevant for studying species invasions worldwide.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus","2",NA,"selected",""

However, studies focusing on the measurement of physiological traits are usually performed under constant temperature regimes. This mismatch between thermal exposure in the field and experimental conditions could act as a stressor agent, as physiological functions are strongly influenced by temperature. Herein, we asked the question whether constant thermal regimes would cause a stress response and impact the immunity of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) when compared with a fluctuating thermal regime. We addressed this question by determining heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, plasma bacteria-killing ability (BKA) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in snakes kept under a constant temperature regime at 30C, and under a fluctuating regime that oscillated between 25C at night and 35C during the day. The experiments had a mirrored design, in which half of the snakes were subjected to a fluctuating-to-constant treatment, while the other half was exposed to a constant-to-fluctuating treatment. The shift from constant to fluctuating thermal regime was accompanied by an increase in plasma CORT levels, indicating the activation of a stress response. Exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime at the onset of the experiments induced a decrease in the BKA of rattlesnakes. H:L ratio was not affected by treatments and, therefore, the shift between thermal regimes seems to have acted as a low-intensity stressor. Our results suggest that removal from temperatures close to the snake's preferred body temperature triggers a stress response in rattlesnakes.  2019.

Rapeseed cultivars have different day length and vernalization requirements, which categorize them into winter, spring, and semiwinter ecotypes. To gain a deeper insight into genetic factors controlling floral transition in B.napus, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the semiwinter doubled haploid line, Ningyou7, at different developmental stages and temperature regimes. The expression profiles of more than 54,000 gene models were compared between different treatments and developmental stages, and the differentially expressed genes were considered as targets for association analysis and genetic mapping to confirm their role in floral transition. Consequently, 36 genes with association to flowering time, seed yield, or both were identified. We found novel indications for neofunctionalization in homologs of known flowering time regulators like VIN3 and FUL.

Malvasia Istriana vineyard on red soils (terra rossa) developed on highly permeable carbonate rocks. We also investigated effects of topsoil irrigation or late summer rains on plant water status and yield. Under the harsh summer environmental conditions of 2015, the plant water status was overall favorable (moderate water deficit) and never reached critical levels, suggesting that irrigation was not mandatory. Leaf conductance to water vapor (gL) measured in July decreased by about 70% compared to spring, while minimum leaf water potential (min) dropped by only 16%, suggesting an isohydric behavior of the cultivar (strict stomatal control of transpiration). Both min and gL reached a minimum in July (peak of drought), and returned to pre-drought values in late summer. Rainfalls or supplemental irrigation (about 40 mm) promoted prompt recovery of plant water status. Irrigation treatments or occasional summer rainfalls can influence the water status of plants, although roots have access to deep water sources. In fact, the isotopic composition of xylem sap was similar to that of soil water sampled in a nearby deep cave, supporting the hypothesis that deep soil is the main water source for grapevines in karstic areas during summertime.

Hosts maintain this symbiosis through continuous regulation of Symbiodinium cell density via expulsion and degradation (postmitotic) and/or constraining cell growth and division through manipulation of the symbiont cell cycle (premitotic). Importance of premitotic regulation is unknown since little data exists on cell cycles for the immense genetic diversity of Symbiodinium. We therefore examined cell cycle progression for several distinct SymbiodiniumITS2-types (B1, C1, D1a). All types exhibited typical microalgal cell cycle progression, G1 phase through to S phase during the light period, and S phase to G2/M phase during the dark period. However, the proportion of cells in these phases differed between strains and reflected differences in growth rates. Undivided larger cells with 3n DNA content were observed especially in type D1a, which exhibited a distinct cell cycle pattern. We further compared cell cycle patterns under different growth light intensities and thermal regimes. Whilst light intensity did not affect cell cycle patterns, heat stress inhibited cell cycle progression and arrested all strains in G1 phase.

It is largely unknown, however, whether individuals sacrifice exposure to their own preferred or optimal environmental conditions so they can remain part of a social group. Here, we demonstrate that individual three-spine sticklebacks vary in the degree to which they forego exposure to their preferred ambient temperature so they can associate with a group of conspecifics. Individual fish varied widely in preferred temperature when tested in isolation. When the same individuals were presented with a choice of a warm or cold thermal regime in the presence of a social group in one of the environments, fish spent more time with the group if it was close to their own individually preferred temperature. When a group was in a relatively cool environment, focal individuals that were more social deviated most strongly from their preferred temperature to associate with the group. Standard and maximum metabolic rate were not related to temperature preference or thermal compromise. However, individuals with a higher standard metabolic rate were less social, and so energetic demand may indirectly influence the environmental costs experienced by group members. The reduced tendency to engage with a social group when there is a large difference between the group temperature and the individuals preferred temperature suggests a role for temperature in group formation and cohesion that is mediated by individual physiology and behaviour. Together, these data highlight exposure to non-preferred temperatures as a potential cost of group membership that probably has important but to date unrecognized implications for metabolic demand, energy allocation, locomotor performance and overall group functioning.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We used a multitaxon distribution model with air temperature and modeled daily flow as predictors. As expected, projected air temperature increased the most in northernmost Finland. Predicted taxonomic richness also increased the most in northern Finland, congruent with the predicted northwards shift of many species distributions. Compositional changes were predicted to be high even without changes in richness, suggesting that species replacement may be the main mechanism causing climate-induced changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Northern streams were predicted to lose much of the seasonality of their flow regimes, causing potentially marked changes in stream benthic assemblages. Sites with the highest loss of seasonality were predicted to support future assemblages that deviate most in compositional similarity from the present-day assemblages. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were also predicted to change more in headwaters than in larger streams, as headwaters were particularly sensitive to changes in flow patterns.

However, for short-lived insects daily fluctuations of temperature could be an important environmental parameter involved in evolutionary adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to daily fluctuating temperatures. We studied replicated selection lines of Drosophila simulans evolved in a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime. Previous studies of these lines have shown clear acclimation benefits to heat tolerance induced by the fluctuating regime. First, we tested the existence of an evolved circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance in selected flies. This was done by investigating the daily variation in time to heat knockdown in flies from both selection regimes when exposed to either a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime for a single generation. While daily variation in heat resistance was found, the results suggest that there was neither an evolved adaptive circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance nor a continuous acclimation response induced by fluctuating temperatures in these lines. Second, in order to reveal functional candidates for adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to a high temperature exposure in flies from both regimes. We found that flies selected both in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes responded similarly to increasing temperature. However, we found that evolutionary adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime led to transcriptional enrichment of the GO terms eggshell chorion assembly and cellular response to heat. The latter category was constituted by a constitutive up-regulation of four Turandot genes and not heat shock protein genes, suggesting that Turandot genes could play a prominent role for adaptation to daily fluctuating thermal conditions.  2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

For example, the culturally and economically important group, Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), experience site-specific thermal regimes during early development that could be disrupted by warming. To test for thermal local adaptation and heritable phenotypic plasticity in Pacific salmon embryos, we measured the developmental rate, survival, and body size at hatching in two populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that overlap in timing of spawning but incubate in contrasting natural thermal regimes. Using a split half-sibling design, we exposed embryos of 10 families from each of two populations to variable and constant thermal regimes. These represented both experienced temperatures by each population, and predicted temperatures under plausible future conditions based on a warming scenario from the downscaled global climate model (MIROC A1B scenario). We did not find evidence of thermal local adaptation during the embryonic stage for developmental rate or survival. Within treatments, populations hatched within 1day of each other, on average, and among treatments, did not differ in survival in response to temperature. We did detect plasticity to temperature; embryos developed 2.5 times longer (189days) in the coolest regime compared to the warmest regime (74days). We also detected variation in developmental rates among families within and among temperature regimes, indicating heritable plasticity. Families exhibited a strong positive relationship between thermal variability and phenotypic variability in developmental rate but body length and mass at hatching were largely insensitive to temperature. Overall, our results indicated a lack of thermal local adaptation, but a presence of plasticity in populations experiencing contrasting conditions, as well as family-specific heritable plasticity that could facilitate adaptive change.

Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6C, or 6C with a daily pulse of 20C for 7 days. RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes, oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state of M. rotundata. While the mechanisms governing the physiological response to lowtemperature stress are shared, the specific transcripts associated with the response differ between life stages.  2017.

But, the ability of farmed fishes to use energy from digestible forms of carbohydrates contentiously differs based on their feeding habits, anatomicalphysiological features and rearing conditions. Carnivorous fishes, in particular, are considered to be poor in utilising dietary carbohydrates mainly due to their low intestinal glucose uptake rates and slow blood glucose clearance. Hence, they have been the subject of most studies focusing on carbohydrate nutrition and metabolism. The findings overwhelmingly indicate the presence of almost all the essential biological elements, but with differences in the regulatory mechanism. On the other hand, the changing trends in fish feed formulation with progressively higher inclusion levels of plant ingredients will invariably introduce more carbohydrates, necessitating coping strategies in fish. In this aquaculture oriented context, our review intends to put together pieces of the puzzle of dietary carbohydrate utilisation in fish based on new insights gained with respect to 1) the various biological, nutritional and environmental factors influencing carbohydrate use such as feeding habit based evolutionary hardwiring, genotypic differences, sustained swimming exercise, influence of other dietary components, carbohydrate source characteristics, gelatinization, meal timing and changes in thermal regime 2) the inherently limiting steps beginning with low adaptability in digestive and glucose transport capacities, poor glucose homeostasis, complex hormonal regulation, distinctive glucose, energy and nutrient sensing mechanisms, regulatory deficits in hepatic intermediary metabolism and weak glucose utilization in peripheral tissues and 3) promising future approaches to augment carbohydrate use in fish such as nutritional programming in early life, genetic selection, supplementation of exogenous enzymes, fine tuning dietary macronutrient balance and promoting beneficial hostmicrobe interactions in the digestive tract.  2016 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Scopus",NA,NA,"selected",""

Temperatures are expected to continue to rise in the future, along with a greater degree of climatic instability. Such changes could have potentially serious consequences for oviparous ectotherms, especially those with temperature-dependent sex determination. To investigate the effects of temperature on a range of developmental phenomena in a population of western pond turtles (Emys marmorata), we placed temperature sensors on top of each layer of eggs within nests and recorded temperatures hourly through the first 23 mo of incubation. These methods allowed us to look at in situ nest temperatures with high resolution. We found that mean incubation temperatures were similar between different nests and at different levels within nests but that incubation temperature fluctuations and maximum incubation temperatures differed greatly in both cases. The hatchling turtles were more likely to be female if they spent 30% or more of their sex-determining period of incubation above 297C. Hatching success was best predicted by the maximum incubation temperature. We also found that incubation duration tended to be shorter as the mean temperature increased. However, exposure to either extremely high or low temperatures extended incubation times.  2016 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

We examined the low temperature biology of third instar feeding and wandering larvae in and out of food. We induced phenotypic plasticity of thermal biology by rearing under short days and fluctuating temperatures (5.519C). Rearing under fluctuating temperatures led to much slower development (42.1days egg-adult) compared to control conditions (constant 21.5C; 15.7days), and yielded larger adults of both sexes. D. suzukii larvae were chill-susceptible, being killed by low temperatures not associated with freezing, and freezing survival was not improved when ice formation was inoculated externally via food or silver iodide. Feeding larvae were more cold tolerant than wandering larvae, especially after rearing under fluctuating temperatures, and rearing under fluctuating temperatures improved survival of prolonged cold (0C) to beyond 72h in both larval stages. There was no evidence that acute cold tolerance could be improved by rapid cold-hardening. We conclude that D. suzukii has the capacity to develop at low temperatures under fluctuating temperatures, but that they have limited cold tolerance.

To date, few studies have addressed the breadth of diversity of physiological functions of these lipids and whether those functions are conserved across the hopanoid-producing bacterial phyla. Here, we generated mutants in the filamentous cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme, that are unable to make all hopanoids (shc) or 2-methylhopanoids (hpnP). While the absence of hopanoids impedes growth of vegetative cells at high temperature, the shc mutant grows faster at low temperature. This finding is consistent with hopanoids acting as membrane rigidifiers, a function shared by other hopanoid-producing phyla. Apart from impacting fitness under temperature stress, hopanoids are dispensable for vegetative cells under other stress conditions. However, hopanoids are required for stress tolerance in akinetes, a resting survival cell type. While 2-methylated hopanoids do not appear to contribute to any stress phenotype, total hopanoids and to a lesser extent 2-methylhopanoids were found to promote the formation of cyanophycin granules in akinetes. Finally, although hopanoids support symbiotic interactions between Alphaproteobacteria and plants, they do not appear to facilitate symbiosis between N.punctiforme and the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus. Collectively, these findings support interpreting hopanes as general environmental stress biomarkers. If hopanoid-mediated enhancement of nitrogen-rich storage products turns out to be a conserved phenomenon in other organisms, a better understanding of this relationship may help us parse the enrichment of 2-methylhopanes in the rock record during episodes of disrupted nutrient cycling.  2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 162316C and regime 2 included a range of 1621262116C (mean temperature 20.1C) compared to a 20.1C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible.

However, is it unclear how often invasive populations evolve germination characteristics different from native populations, because few studies have isolated genetic variation by using seed from garden- grown plants. Additionally, while herbivore-induced transgenerational effects are common, it is unknown whether maternal herbivory differentially shapes germination in native and introduced offspring. METHODS: We explored germination in native and introduced populations of the North American invader Verbascum thapsus using seed from gardengrown maternal plants, half of which were protected from herbivores. To elucidate (1) germination niche breadth and (2) whether germination conditions affected expression of genetic structuring among populations, we germinated seed under four ecologically relevant temperature regimes. KEY RESULTS: Native populations had a wide germination niche breadth, germinating as well as or better than introduced populations. At cooler temperatures, native populations exhibited a genetically based environmental cline indicative of local adaptation, with populations from warmer locales germinating better than populations from cooler locales. However, this cline was obscured when maternal plants were attacked by herbivores, revealing that local stressors can override the expression of geographic structuring. Introduced populations did not exhibit clinal variation, suggesting its disruption during the introduction process. C ONCLUSIONS: Native and introduced populations have evolved genetic differences in germination. The result of this difference manifests in a wider germination niche breadth in natives, suggesting that the invasive behavior of V. thapsus in North America is attributable to other factors.  2016 Botanical Society of America.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

We subjected ovigerous lobsters to typical inshore or offshore water temperatures from September to August in the laboratory (n = 8 inshore and 8 offshore, each year) and in the field (n = 8 each, inshore and offshore), over 2 successive years. Although the rate of egg development did not differ significantly between treatments in the fall (P ~ 0.570), eggs exposed to inshore thermal regimes developed faster in the spring (P < 0.001). Inshore eggs hatched about 30 days earlier (mean = 26 June) than offshore eggs (mean = 27 July), and their time of development from the onset of eyespot to hatch was significantly shorter (inshore = 287  11 days vs. offshore: 311.5  7.5 days, P = 0.034). Associated growing degree-days (GDD) did not differ significantly between inshore and offshore thermal treatments (P = 0.061). However, eggs retained by lobsters exposed to offshore thermal regimes accumulated more GDD in the winter than did eggs carried by inshore lobsters, while eggs exposed to inshore temperatures acquired them more rapidly in the spring.

However, robustness in the face of a changing environment may often be beneficial for traits that are tightly linked to fitness. We hypothesized that robustness of some traits may depend on specific patterns of plasticity within and among other traits. We used a reaction norm approach to study robustness and phenotypic plasticity of three life-history traits of the collembolan Orchesella cincta in environments with different thermal regimes. We measured adult mass, age at maturity and growth rate of males and females from heath and forest habitats at two temperatures (12 and 22C). We found evidence for ecotype-specific robustness of female adult mass to temperature, with a higher level of robustness in the heath ecotype. This robustness is facilitated by plastic adjustments of growth rate and age at maturity. Furthermore, female fecundity is strongly influenced by female adult mass, explaining the importance of realizing a high mass across temperatures for females. These findings indicate that different predicted outcomes of life-history theory can be combined within one species' ontogeny and that models describing life-history strategies should not assume that traits like growth rate are maximized under all conditions.

Long-term exposure to low temperatures, commonly referred to as chilling, can lead to physiological effects collectively known as chill injury. Periodically increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) were exposed to a constant temperature of 6C, or 6C with a daily fluctuation to 20C. RNA was collected at two different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels. Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.  2015.

Under standard management conditions, the alfalfa leafcutting bee develops to the diapausing prepupal stage under field conditions, after which they are cold-stored at a static temperature until the following spring, when temperatures are raised and development resumes. We have assessed the effects of a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) during overwintering cold storage, where bees were exposed to a daily 1 h pulse of 20C, and compared viability and insect quality to bees stored under a static thermal regime. Our results demonstrate that implementing an FTR protocol dramatically increases the survival of cold-stored alfalfa leafcutting bees, effectively extending their shelf-life into the subsequent growing season. These findings could substantially ameliorate significant obstacles that restrict the more widespread use of this important pollinator, such as the biological constraints that restrict its use in early blooming crops, and yearly fluctuations in bee prices that add significant financial uncertainty to end users. This study also strengthens a growing body of evidence that indicates FTR protocols are superior to static thermal regime protocols for insect cold storage.  2013 Entomological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","3",NA,"selected",""

The potential of corals to acclimatize to temperatures exceeding historical thermal regimes was investigated by reciprocal transplantation of Acropora millepora colonies between the warm central and cool southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for a duration of 14 months. Colony fragments retained at native sites remained healthy, whereas transplanted fragments, although healthy over initial months when temperatures remained within native thermal regimes, subsequently bleached and suffered mortality during seasonal temperature extremes. Corals hosting Symbiodinium D transplanted to the southern GBR bleached in winter and the majority suffered whole (40%; n = 20 colonies) or partial (50%) mortality at temperatures 1.1C below their 15-year native minimum. In contrast, corals hosting Symbiodinium C2 transplanted to the central GBR bleached in summer and suffered whole (50%; n = 10 colonies) or partial (42%) mortality at temperatures 2.5C above their 15-year native maximum. During summer bleaching, the dominant Symbiodinium type changed from C2 to D within corals transplanted to the central GBR. Corals transplanted to the cooler, southern GBR grew 74-80% slower than corals at their native site, and only 50% of surviving colonies reproduced, at least partially because of cold water bleaching of transplants. Despite the absence of any visual signs of stress, corals transplanted to the warmer, central GBR grew 52-59% more slowly than corals at their native site before the summer bleaching (i.e., from autumn to spring). Allocation of energy to initial acclimatization or reproduction may explain this pattern, as the majority (65%) of transplants reproduced one month earlier than portions of the same colonies retained at the southern native site. All parameters investigated (bleaching, mortality, Symbiodinium type fidelity, reproductive timing) demonstrated strong interactions between genotype and environment, indicating that the acclimatization potential of A. millepora populations may be limited by adaptation of the holobiont to native thermal regimes.  2013 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

However, given time, species may be able to acclimate to increasing temperature. Thus, it is useful to determine if short-term responses provide a good predictor for long-term acclimation ability. The tropical reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus was used to test whether the ability for developmental thermal acclimation of two populations was indicated by their short-term metabolic response to temperature. While both populations exhibited similar short-term responses of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to temperature, fish from the higher-latitude population were able to fully acclimate RMR, while the lower-latitude population could only partially compensate RMR at the warmest temperature. These differences in acclimation ability are most likely due to genetic differences between the populations rather than differences in thermal regimes. This research indicates that acclimation ability may vary greatly between populations and that understanding such variation will be critical for predicting the impacts of warming environmental temperatures. Moreover, the thermal metabolic reaction norm does not appear to be a good predictor of long-term acclimation ability.  2012 The Authors.

This is achieved by timing the initiation of spring bee incubation so that adults will emerge 2 wk before peak bloom. If weather conditions change so as to delay the bloom, bee managers will commonly expose the developing bees to a period of low-temperature incubation to slow their development. We have previously demonstrated survival during low-temperature incubation can be significantly increased by using a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) where the bees receive a daily pulse at 20C. A FTR incubation protocol is composed of a number of different components, such as the base and pulse temperatures, and the duration and frequency of the pulse. In this investigation, the effect of the duration of the pulse (5120 min) and the frequency of a pulse (twice daily to weekly) on the survival of developing M. rotundata was examined. A pulse as short as 5 min at 20C increased survival of the developing bees as compared with the constant 6C controls. Increasing the pulse duration induced a further increase in tolerance to 6C. As with the pulse duration, increasing the pulse frequency from once weekly to twice daily had a significant effect on improving the bees tolerance to low-temperature incubation. This investigation further strengthens the argument that a FTR protocol is superior to using a constant low-temperature exposure for interrupting the spring incubation of M. rotundata.  2012 Entomological Society of America.","Article","Scopus","1",NA,"selected",""

These models are frequently based on the assumption that the northern and southern boundaries of a species' range define its thermal niche. However, this assumption may be violated if populations are adapted to local temperature regimes and have evolved population-specific thermal optima. Considering the prevalence of local adaptation, the assumption of a species-wide thermal optimum may be violated for many species. We used spatially and temporally extensive demographic data for American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) to examine range-wide variation in response of population growth rate () to climatic factors. Our results suggest adaptation to local temperature, but not precipitation. For each population,  was maximized when annual temperatures were similar to site-specific, long-term mean temperatures. Populations from disparate climatic zones responded differently to temperature variation, and there was a linear relation between population-level thermal optima and the 30-year mean temperature at each site. For species that are locally adapted to temperature, bioclimatic envelope models may underestimate the extent to which increasing temperatures will decrease population growth rate. Because any directional change from long-term mean temperatures will decrease population growth rates, all populations throughout a species' range will be adversely affected by temperature increase, not just populations at southern and low-elevation boundaries. Additionally, when a species' local thermal niche is narrower than its range-wide thermal niche, a smaller temperature increase than would be predicted by bioclimatic envelope approaches may be sufficient to decrease population growth.  2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Article","Scopus","5",NA,"selected",""

For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18C and 28C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (30C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through bodytemperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.  2010 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Scopus","6",NA,"selected",""

Eighty juvenile sea cucumbers, with a mean wet weight of 2.8  0.8g, were allocated to 20 experimental groups and allocated to constant temperature (18C), and small (18  2C), medium (18  4C) and large (18  6C) daily temperature fluctuation regimes. Five groups were allocated to each regime. After the 35-day experimental period, the effects of different temperature regimes on growth, activities of glycolytic enzymes, enzymatic antioxidant defenses and expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in juvenile sea cucumbers were measured. The small and medium temperature fluctuations could accelerate growth of sea cucumbers and the large temperature fluctuation retarded growth. Hexokinase activity at small and medium temperature treatments was significantly higher than that at the constant temperature. SOD activities at medium and large temperature fluctuations were significantly higher than that at the small temperature fluctuation treatment. These results indicated a possible higher utilization of carbohydrate through glycolytic cycle at the small and medium temperature fluctuations, and an enhancement of oxidative stress under the medium and the large temperature fluctuations. Hsp70 level at the large temperature fluctuation was significantly higher than at the other three treatments. The enhancement of Hsp70 at the large temperature fluctuation indicated a possible high level of protein damage which might result in an increased energetic cost that could retard growth of sea cucumbers.  2008 Elsevier B.V.
