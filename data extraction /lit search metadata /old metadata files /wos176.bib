AB This study sought to determine the effect of water temperature on the
   effectiveness of artificial reproduction of dace brooders under
   laboratory and field conditions. Three temperatures were tested in the
   laboratory: 9.5, 12 and 14.5 degrees C (+/- 0.1 degrees C). The water
   temperature under field conditions was 11.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C (Czarci
   jar Fish Farm) and 13.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C (janowo Fish Farm). The study
   showed that artificial reproduction of dace is possible in all the
   temperature ranges under study and an embryo survival rate of over 87%
   can be achieved. Dace has also been found to be very sensitive to rapid
   temperature changes, even within the temperature ranges optimal for the
   species. Such changes have an adverse effect on the outcome of the
   reproduction process, such as a decrease in the percentage of
   reproducing females, a decrease in the pseudo-gonado-somatic index
   (PGS1) and a decrease in the embryo survival rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Schistosomiasis, the most common water-borne infection worldwide,
   continues to pose a serious public health challenge in developing
   nations and to travellers who visit these endemic regions. We apply
   optimal control on a temperature dependent schistosomiasis model. Our
   optimal control aims to minimize the pre-patent and patent human
   population at minimal costs. Our analysis and results throughout the
   paper highlight the impact of optimal control shaping the future
   patterns of the disease. Our results show that optimal control can
   significantly reduce the schistosomiasis burden in the community and in
   some instance by more than three-fold. In addition, our results show
   that with low costs the optimal strategy will be carried out at or close
   to its maximum strength for a sufficiently long period of time, so as
   minimize the exposure and infection. With high costs, however, the
   control have to be implemented with reduced or even minimum, strength,
   to achieve an optimal balance between the costs and effects of control.
   Our findings suggest that optimal control theory can be useful on
   minimizing the infected host and vector. The study and its findings can
   provide a useful framework for designing cost-effective control for
   schistosomiasis.

AB We examine the development of Hexarthra bulgarica (Wisniewski)
   populations in relation to thermal stability in natural environments. A
   high frequency sampling program was developed simultaneously in two high
   mountain lakes: a shallow one, with daily large temperature changes but
   little surface-bottom temperature difference and a deeper one with more
   stable temperature but vertical heterogeneity in the water profile.
   Since the capacity of H. bulgarica to perform vertical migrations in
   these lakes of Sierra Nevada is already known, we have studied the
   relationship between egg ratios and chlorophyll-a concentration, mean
   temperatures and temperature instability (measured as the daily rate of
   temperature change - TCR - as well as the surface-bottom temperature
   difference - SBT -) in both lakes. Results show that the intensity of
   temperature fluctuations has a positive effect on the egg-ratios, as TCR
   is only correlated with that variable in the shallow lake and SBT is
   only correlated with egg-ratios in the deeper one.

AB Our understanding of how oxidative stress resistance phenotypes are
   affected by the developmental environment is limited. One component of
   the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life
   oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of
   temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations
   affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in
   red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First,
   to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress,
   eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5
   degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3
   degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature
   fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of
   three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations
   every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the
   influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a
   daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature
   of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C
   (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was
   unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both
   temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature.
   Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations
   had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was
   associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although
   sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by
   developmental thermal environments, potentially because of
   temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences
   in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and
   overwinter survival.

AB Vertebrates with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) have
   justifiably received a lot of attention when it comes to the potential
   effects of climate change. Freshwater turtles have long been used to
   characterize the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying TSD and
   provide a great system to investigate how changing climatic conditions
   will affect vertebrates with TSD. Unfortunately, most of what we know
   about the mechanisms underlying TSD comes from laboratory conditions
   that do not accurately mimic natural conditions (i.e., constant
   incubation temperatures and supraphysiological steroid manipulations).
   In this paper, we review recent advances in our understanding of how TSD
   operates in nature that arose from studies using more natural
   fluctuating incubation temperatures and natural variation in maternal
   estrogens within the yolk. By incorporating more natural conditions into
   laboratory studies, we are better able to use these studies to predict
   how changing climatic conditions will affect species with TSD.

AB Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through
   behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short-and
   long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of
   large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the
   thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance
   across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may
   limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging
   environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive
   effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop
   in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability
   (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation.
   Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable
   temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation
   influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance
   traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24
   C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B
   conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits,
   thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming
   performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal
   fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal
   dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the
   allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage
   may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of
   temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were
   thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the
   range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high
   temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of
   performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures
   and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an
   interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the
   upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of
   key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the
   thermal variability inherent in their environment.

AB Siderastrea siderea is one of the most abundant corals at high latitude
   shallow sites along the Florida Reef Tract (25 degrees-27 degrees N).
   This species is able to tolerate wide seawater temperature fluctuations
   and sedimentation stress, but its reproductive status at high latitudes
   and under marginal environmental conditions is poorly understood. The
   objectives of this study were to evaluate the reproductive potential of
   S. siderea along a latitudinal gradient (25 degrees-27 degrees N) and to
   determine if sexual maturity occurs in small (<12.0cm) S. siderea
   colonies. Samples of coral tissue were collected in 2007, 2008, and 2009
   at three sites along the latitudinal gradient and were processed for
   histological analysis. Oocyte size, volume, and abundance were used to
   calculate fecundity. Results showed that fecundity decreased with
   increasing latitude and that oocyte volume was the major contributing
   factor to this variation. Mature oocytes were observed in S. siderea
   colonies at sizes as small as 1.1cm in diameter. The ability of S.
   siderea to reach fertility at high latitude areas suggests this species
   is able to reproduce under marginal environmental conditions; however,
   reduction in oocyte size could increase local retention of larvae. The
   presence of mature oocytes in small colonies suggests that stress can
   reduce somatic growth and shift sexual maturity to smaller colony sizes.

PD JUL 2018

AB Insects exposed to low temperature often have high mortality or exhibit
   sublethal effects. A growing number of recent studies have shown
   beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses
   during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The
   physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold
   survival have been extensively studied over the past few years.
   Profiling with various '-omics' techniques has provided supporting
   evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed
   to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic,
   metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of
   homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair
   mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in
   understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial
   effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such
   as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the
   identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed
   homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied
   settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest
   management and pollination services. We also explain how the application
   of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some
   logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival
   at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we
   suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be
   explored more thoroughly. Although FTR is not ecologically relevant,
   similar processes may operate in settings where temperatures fluctuate
   naturally.

   (Arecaceae); mango, Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae); and leguminous
   trees and shrubs (Fabaceae). The biology and ecological parameters of C.
   multicicatrices were investigated using as a host plant Caesalpinia
   pluviosa var. peltophoroides (Fabaceae) under two environmental
   conditions: semifield (max temp., 31.5 +/- 3.0A degrees C; max. RH, 78.9
   A +/- 6.0%) and a glass house (max. temp., 37.1 A +/- 5.1A degrees C,
   max. RH, 67.0 A +/- 6.2%) in the premises of Corpoica, Palmira Research
   Station. The duration of the different developmental stages was highly
   different under both temperature conditions. First- and third-instar
   nymphs, the period of ovisac growth of the adult, and the duration of
   the life cycle were significantly higher in the semifield conditions
   compared to the glass house conditions. In contrast, the second-instar
   nymph stage was shorter in the semifield conditions. The duration of the
   fourth-instar stage (adult) and the reproductive period were the same in
   both environments. As for the evaluated ecological parameters, a great
   difference was found between the two environmental conditions, where the
   net reproductive rate (R (o)) and mean generation time (T) were
   significantly higher in the semifield conditions than in the glass house
   conditions. The obtained biological and ecological information is an
   essential tool for finding strategies to control this insect pest. This
   is the first detailed study on the biology of a species in the genus
   Crypticerya Cockerell.

   had no effect on the colour of population dynamics. All population
   dynamics in this experiment were reddened, regardless of environmental
   colour. iii! Models predict that populations will crack reddened

   variability and that populations with a higher intrinsic growth rate (r)
   will track environmental variability more closely than populations with
   a low r. The experimental populations behaved as predicted. (iii! Models
   predict that population variability is determined by interaction between
   r and the environmental variability. The experimental populations
   behaved as predicted. These results show that (i) reddened population
   dynamics mall need no special explanation, such as reddened
   environments, spatial subdivision or interspecific interactions, and

   colour, in agreement with population models. Correct specification of

AB Exposing insects to a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) compared with
   constant low temperature (CLT) significantly reduces cold-induced
   mortality. The beneficial effects of FTR result from physiological
   repair during warming intervals. The duration and the temperature
   experienced during the recovery period are supposed to strongly impact
   the resulting cold survival; however, disentangling the effects of both
   recovery variables had not been broadly investigated. In this study, we
   investigate cold tolerance (lethal time, Lt(50)) of the polyphagous
   beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. We examined adult survival under various
   CLTs (0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C), and under 20 different FTR conditions,
   where the 0 degrees C exposure alternated with various recovery
   temperatures (Rt) (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) combined with various
   recovery durations (Rds) (0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h). Under CLTs, Lt(50)
   increased with temperature until no mortality occurred above the upper
   limit of cold injury zone (ULCIZ). Under FTRs, Lt(50) increased with
   both Rt and Rd. The magnitude of the survival gain was clearly boosted
   when Rt was above the ULCIZ (at 20 degrees C). Based on a data matrix of
   lethal times with multiple Rt x Rd combinations, a predictive model
   showed that cold survival increased exponentially with Rt and Rd. This
   model was subsequently validated with additional survival tests. We
   suggest that increasing recovery durations associated with optimal
   recovery temperatures eventually leads to a progressive chilling
   compensation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most organisms are exposed to bouts of warm temperatures during

   waves increase in frequency and duration as predicted, it is necessary
   to understand how these bouts could affect thermally sensitive species,
   including reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD).
   In a multi-year study using fluctuating temperatures, we
   exposedTrachemys scriptaembryos to cooler, male-producing temperatures
   interspersed with warmer, female-producing temperatures (heat waves)
   that varied in either timing during development or continuity and then
   analysed resulting sex ratios. We also quantified the expression of
   genes involved in testis differentiation (Dmrt1) and ovary
   differentiation (Cyp19A1) to determine how heat wave continuity affects
   the expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation. Heat waves
   applied during the middle of development produced significantly more
   females compared to heat waves that occurred just 7 days before or after
   this window, and even short gaps in the continuity of a heat wave
   decreased the production of females. Continuous heat exposure resulted
   in increasedCyp19A1expression while discontinuous heat exposure failed
   to increase expression in either gene over a similar time course. We
   report that even small differences in the timing and continuity of heat
   waves can result in drastically different phenotypic outcomes. This
   strong effect of temperature occurred despite the fact that embryos were
   exposed to the same number of warm days during a short period of time,
   which highlights the need to study temperature effects under more
   ecologically relevant conditions where temperatures may be elevated for
   only a few days at a time. In the face of a changing climate, the
   finding that subtle shifts in temperature exposure result in substantial
   effects on embryonic development becomes even more critical.

AB Phalaenopsis orchids are among the most valuable potted flowering crops
   commercially produced throughout the world because of their long flower
   life and ease of crop scheduling to meet specific market dates. During
   commercial production, Phalaenopsis are usually grown at an air
   temperature >= 28 degrees C to inhibit flower initiation, and a cooler
   night than day temperature regimen (e.g. 25/20 degrees C day/night) is
   used to induce flowering. However, the specific effect of day and night
   temperature on flower initiation has not been well described, and the
   reported requirement for a diurnal temperature fluctuation to elicit
   flowering is unclear. Two Phalaenopsis clones were grown in glass
   greenhouse compartments with constant temperature set points of 14, 17,
   20, 23, 26, or 29 degrees C and fluctuating day/night (12 h/12 h)
   temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/17, or 29/23 degrees C.
   The photoperiod was 12 h, and the maximum irradiance was controlled to
   <= 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). After 20 weeks, >= 80% of plants of both
   clones had a visible inflorescence when grown at constant 14, 17, 20, or
   23 degrees C and at fluctuating day/night temperatures of 20/14 degrees
   C or 23/17 degrees C. None of the plants were reproductive within 20
   weeks when grown at a constant 29 degrees C or at 29/17 degrees C or
   29/23 degrees C day/night temperature regimens. The number of
   inflorescences per plant and the number of flower buds on the first
   inflorescence were greatest when the average daily temperature was 14
   degrees C or 17 degrees C. These results indicate that a day/night
   fluctuation in temperature is not required for inflorescence initiation
   in these two Phalaenopsis clones. Furthermore, the inhibition of
   flowering when the day temperature was 29 degrees C and the night
   temperature was 17 degrees C or 23 degrees C suggests that a warm day
   temperature inhibits flower initiation in Phalaenopsis.

AB Rapidly cooling pigs after heat stress (HS) results in a
   pathophysiological condition, and because rapid temperature fluctuations
   may be associated with reduced reproductive success in sows, it lends
   itself to the hypothesis that these conditions may be linked. Objectives
   were to determine the effects of rapid cooling on thermal response and
   future reproductive success in pigs. Thirty-six replacement gifts (137.8
   +/- 0.9 kg BW) were estrus synchronized and then 14.1 +/- 0.4 d after
   estrus confirmation, pigs were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (TN;
   n=12; 19.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C) for 6 h, or HS (36.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C)
   for 3 h, followed by 3 h of rapid cooling (HSRC; n=12; immediate TN
   exposure and water dousing) or gradual cooling (HSGC; n=12; gradual
   decrease to TN conditions) repeated over 2 d. Vaginal (T-V) and
   gastrointestinal tract temperatures (T-GI) were obtained every 15 min,
   and blood was collected on d 1 and d 2 during the HS and recovery
   periods at 180 and 60 min, respectively. Pigs were bred 8.3 +/- 0.8 d
   after thermal treatments over 2 d. Reproductive tracts were collected
   and total fetus number and viability were recorded 28.0 +/- 0.8 d after
   insemination. HS increased T-V and T-GI (P=0.01; 0.98 degrees C) in HSRC
   and HSGC compared to TN pigs. During recovery, T-V was reduced from 15
   to 105 min (P=0.01; 033 degrees C) in HSRC compared to HSGC pigs, but no
   overall differences in T-GI were detected (P<0.05; 39.67 degrees C).
   Rapid cooling increased (P<0.05) TNF alpha compared to HSGC and TN pigs
   during recovery-d 1 (55.2%), HS-d 2 (35.1%), and recovery-d 2 (64.9%).
   Viable fetuses tended to be reduced (P=0.08; 10.5%) and moribund fetuses
   tended to be increased (P=0.09; 159.3%) in HSRC compared to HSGC and TN
   pigs. In summary, rapid cooling prior to breeding may contribute to
   reduced fetal viability and reproductive success in pigs. Published by

AB A series of empirically-derived equations were developed from data
   spanning the 32 year history (1969-2000) that predict or reconstruct
   water temperatures of the inflowing river, the near surface or
   epilimnion, and the deep and outflowing waters of subtropical Canyon
   Reservoir on the Guadalupe River in southcentral Texas, USA. Inflowing
   and near surface water temperatures both can be predicted from local air
   temperatures. We used a 5 day or I day (in the case of high inflows
   associated with storm fronts) averaging period of air temperature for
   the river and a 30 day period for the reservoir surface water.
   Predictions of deep water and outflow temperatures were more complex in
   this bottom-draining reservoir. During the winter months, when the
   reservoir was nearest to being isothermal, air temperature was the
   primary factor used to predict deep temperatures. For the remainder of
   the year, the rate at which water was released from the reservoir tended
   to be the most important factor in predicting deep temperatures,
   although the air temperature of the previous winter could also be
   important. During drier years, the cold hypolinmetic waters are retained
   throughout the stratified period, and outflows were as cool as 12-13
   degrees C in August and September. During very wet years the cold
   hypolinmetic waters are lost downstream early, and August and September
   outflows may be as warm as 23-24 degrees C. Therefore, interannual
   variation in the temperature of the hypolimnion and tailwaters is quite
   high. This represents a thermal stress to the local biota that is very
   different from the idea of "thermal constancy" commonly associated with
   other reservoir tailwater habitats. Because of this reservoir's
   particular sensitivity to variation in flow, projections of future
   change in runoff (as the climate changes) may have a greater effect on
   the thermal environment of this reservoir than will change in
   atmospheric temperature.

AB Southern ground-hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri inhabit savanna and
   bushveld regions of South Africa. They nest in the austral summer which
   coincides with the wet season and hottest daytime temperatures in the
   region. They are secondary cavity nesters and typically nest in large
   cavities in trees, cliffs and earth banks, but readily use artificial
   nest boxes. Southern ground-hornbills are listed as Endangered in South
   Africa, with reintroductions into suitable areas highlighted as a viable
   conservation intervention for the species. Nest microclimate, and the
   possible implications this may have for the breeding biology of southern
   ground-hornbills, have never been investigated. We used temperature
   dataloggers to record nest cavity temperature and ambient temperature
   for one artificial and 11 natural southern ground-hornbill tree cavity
   nests combined, spanning two breeding seasons. Mean hourly nest
   temperature, as well as mean minimum and mean maximum nest temperature,
   differed significantly between southern ground-hornbill nests in both
   breeding seasons. Mean nest temperature also differed significantly from
   mean ambient temperature for both seasons. Natural nest cavities
   provided a buffer against the ambient temperature fluctuations. The
   artificial nest provided little insulation against temperature extremes,
   being warmer and cooler than the maximum and minimum local ambient
   temperatures, respectively. Nest cavity temperature was not found to
   have an influence on the breeding success of the southern
   ground-hornbill groups investigated in this study. These results have
   potentially important implications for southern ground-hornbill
   conservation and artificial nest design, as they suggest that the birds
   can tolerate greater nest cavity temperature extremes than previously
   thought.

AB Temperature variation within a year can impact biological processes
   driving population abundances. The implications for the ecosystem
   services these populations provide, including food production from
   marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature
   variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested
   species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures.
   Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that
   greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but
   harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally
   diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries
   dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces
   yields, but current levels of functional diversity (FD) of targeted
   species, measured using traits related to species' responses to
   temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high FD of catch
   could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8% relative to projections if FD
   were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast,
   species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a
   similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence
   that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the
   provisioning of ecosystem services, but that FD can buffer these
   negative impacts.

AB Many efforts in nanobiotechnologies are devoted to the realization of
   nanodevices based on single receptors for the detection of specific
   ligands. An interesting tool to monitor the detection process, is
   provided by the study of the electrical properties of such a device. To
   estimate the sensitivity of this nanotool, we simulate the current
   response to an applied AC voltage of a nanodevice realized by a single
   G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in contact with two metallic
   electrodes. To this purpose, recently, we have proposed a model based on
   a coarse grained approach that describes the protein as a static network
   of elementary impedances. The nodes of the network correspond to the
   positions of the Ca atoms of each protein amino acid and an elementary
   impedance is associated with each link. Here, we present an extension of
   this model which accounts for the impedance noise due to thermal
   fluctuations of the atomic positions within a rhodopsin molecule. In our
   model, the Ca atoms are treated as a set of independent harmonic
   oscillators, characterized by two different values of the force constant
   for a-helix and for loops. The impedance noise is then calculated for
   different temperatures and compared with the impedance variation due to
   the conformational change from the ground to the activated state of
   rhodopsim.

AB Temperature directly affects survival, development and reproduction in
   insects and thereby it is a key environmental driver for geographic
   distribution and population dynamics. This study aims at testing the
   survival of Drosophila melanogaster under constant low temperatures
   (CLTs) (2, 3, 4, and 5 degrees C) vs. fluctuating thermal regimes
   (FTRs). In the latter, the cold stress period was interrupted daily by 2
   h pulses at 20 degrees C. Since acclimation enhances cold tolerance, we
   tested whether benefits of acclimation can combine with those of FTRs.
   Since D. melanogaster overwinters as non-reproductive adults, we tested
   if actively reproducing adults are more susceptible to cold stress than
   virgin females that have a much reduced reproductive activity. The
   results show that short interruptions of cold stress enhanced survival
   of adult flies. Survival was time- and temperature-dependent. Prior
   acclimation to low temperature allowed flies to better cope with cold
   stress under CLTs. On the other hand, acclimated flies did not profit
   from the benefits of FTRs and even showed lower survival under FTRs,
   probably because flies deacclimated during the periodic warm intervals.
   Gravid females were overall less cold tolerant than virgin females, and
   both survived better under FTRs. Cold survival at pupal stage was much
   lower than at adult stage, and no clear benefit of FIR was observed in
   this life stage. Our study highlights critical variables to take into
   account when designing experiments of prolonged exposure to low
   temperature in insects.

AB Plants have become physiologically adapted to a seasonally shifting
   environment by evolving many sensory mechanisms. Seasonal flowering is a
   good example of adaptation to local environmental demands and is crucial
   for maximizing reproductive fitness. Photoperiod and temperature are
   major environmental stimuli that control flowering through expression of
   a floral inducer, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein. Recent discoveries
   made using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that the
   functions of photoreceptors are essential for the timing of FT gene
   induction, via modulation of the transcriptional activator CONSTANS (CO)
   at transcriptional and post-translational levels in response to seasonal
   variations. The activation of FT transcription by the fine-tuned CO
   protein enables plants to switch from vegetative growth to flowering
   under inductive environmental conditions. The present review briefly
   summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by
   which the information of environmental stimuli is sensed and transduced
   to trigger FT induction in leaves.

AB Thermal stress is a pervasive selective agent in natural populations
   that impacts organismal growth, survival, and reproduction. Drosophila
   melanogaster exhibits a variety of putatively adaptive phenotypic
   responses to thermal stress in natural and experimental settings;
   however, accompanying assessments of fitness are typically lacking.
   Here, we quantify changes in fitness and known thermal tolerance traits
   in replicated experimental D. melanogaster populations following more
   than 40 generations of evolution to either cyclic cold or hot
   temperatures. By evaluating fitness for both evolved populations
   alongside a reconstituted starting population, we show that the evolved
   populations were the best adapted within their respective thermal
   environments. More strikingly, the evolved populations exhibited
   increased fitness in both environments and improved resistance to both
   acute heat and cold stress. This unexpected parallel response appeared
   to be an adaptation to the rapid temperature changes that drove the
   cycling thermal regimes, as parallel fitness changes were not observed
   when tested in a constant thermal environment. Our results add to a
   small, but growing group of studies that demonstrate the importance of
   fluctuating temperature changes for thermal adaptation and highlight the
   need for additional work in this area.

AB 1.  The body temperature, T(b), of female cockroaches Blaberus craniifer
   exposed to controlled variations in ambient temperature, T(a), was
   precisely monitored.  The curves were fitted to a first-order Newtonian
   model and compared to those obtained in similar conditions with an inert
   replica.  Although the fit was fairly good, insect curves significantly
   differed from those of the passive system.
   2.  Compared with animals raised at a variable temperature (27 +/-
   2.5-degrees-C), the variability of the parameters of the model was much
   increased in animals raised at a stable temperature (27 +/-
   0.5-degrees-C).  This corroborates our previous findings on the
   existence of increased morphological and behavioural variability in the
   latter conditions.
   3.  In view of these differences, it is proposed to restrict the term
   poikilothermy to ectothermic animals who have actually lived in a
   thermally variable environment, and to designate by apoikilothermy the
   status of ectothermic animals who have only experienced a very constant
   ambient temperature.

AB Free-ranging primates are confronted with the challenge of maintaining
   an optimal range of body temperatures within a thermally dynamic
   environment that changes daily, seasonally, and annually. While many
   laboratory studies have been conducted on primate thermoregulation, we
   know comparatively little about the thermal pressures primates face in
   their natural, evolutionarily relevant environment. Such knowledge is
   critical to understanding the evolution of thermal adaptations in
   primates and for comparative evaluation of humans' unique thermal
   adaptations. We examined temperature and thermal environment in
   free-ranging, mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in a tropical
   dry forest in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We recorded subcutaneous (T-sc)
   and near-animal ambient temperatures (T-a) from 11 animals over 1586.5
   sample hours during wet and dry seasons. Howlers displayed considerable
   variation in T-sc, which was largely attributable to circadian effects.
   Despite significant seasonal changes in the ambient thermal environment,
   howlers showed relatively little evidence for seasonal changes in T-sc.
   Howlers experienced warm thermal conditions which led to body cooling
   relative to the environment, and plateaus in T-sc at increasingly warm
   T-a. They also frequently faced cool thermal conditions (T-a < T-sc) in
   which T-sc was markedly elevated compared with T-a. These data add to a
   growing body of evidence that non-human primates have more labile body
   temperatures than humans. Our data additionally support a hypothesis
   that, despite inhabiting a dry tropical environment, howling monkeys
   experience both warm and cool thermal pressures. This suggests that
   thermal challenges may be more prevalent for primates than previously
   thought, even for species living in nonextreme thermal environments. Am

AB In this paper, the correlations between the variations of Chinese pine
   (Pines tabulaeformis Carr.) tree ring width in Shenyang suburb (Fu
   Mausoleum) and the local temperature variables, Global Surface Air
   Temperature Anomaly (GSATA) from 1880 to 2004, Global Land-Ocean
   Temperature (GLOTI) from 1880 to 2004 and North Hemisphere Temperature
   Anomaly (NHTA) from 1880 to 2004 were studied. Some close correlations
   were detected, and the local temperature variables, GSATA, GLOTI and
   NHTA had some similar influences on the Chinese pine tree ring width.
   The air temperature in last winter ( December and January) and in spring
   (April and May) affected the growth of Chinese pine significantly (P <
   0.05). There existed a 3-8-year. periodicity of the variation of Chinese
   pine tree ring width and the GSATA, GLOTI and NHTA, and the 19.3-year
   and 23. 2-year quasi-periodicity of the variation of Chinese pine tree
   ring width corresponded with the 20. 8-year quasi-periodicity of GSATA,
   GLOTI and NHTA. This study suggested that the Chinese pine tree ring
   width in Shenyang Fu Mausoleum had positive correlations with
   global-scale temperature fluctuation, and the temperature increase in
   the past had a positive effect on the Chinese pine growth.

AB Exposure to stressful low temperatures during development can result in
   the accumulation of deleterious physiological effects called chill
   injury. Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and
   oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured
   insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when
   chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse
   during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of
   damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional
   responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to
   constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa
   leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and
   qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6
   degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily pulse of 20 degrees C for 7 days.
   RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of
   transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes,
   oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms
   provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury
   across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts
   observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence
   in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of
   the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression
   profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those
   differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state
   of M. rotundata. While the mechanisms governing the physiological
   response to lowtemperature stress are shared, the specific transcripts
   associated with the response differ between life stages.

AB Expression of heat shock proteins has been proposed as an underlying
   mechanism of increased cold tolerance in insects exposed to fluctuating
   thermal regimes (FTRs) in comparison to constant low temperatures
   (CLTs). We found that the levels of Pahsp70 mRNA increase by up to 3
   orders in the linden bugs, Pyrrhocoris apterus exposed to FTR -5 degrees
   C (22h)/25 degrees C (2h). The 2h-long warm pulses, however, were not
   sufficient for accumulation of PaHSP70 protein and thus no significant
   difference in expression of PaHSP70 protein was detected between FTR and
   CLT regimes. Hence, we conclude that the accumulation of PaHSP70 protein
   is not the mechanism underlying the increased cold tolerance in P.
   apterus at the particular FTR used in this study. The relevance of some
   other possible mechanisms is discussed.

AB This study aimed to examine thermoregulatory responses in birds facing
   two commonly experienced stressors, cold and fasting. Logging devices
   allowing long-term and precise access to internal body temperature were
   placed within the gizzards of ducklings acclimated to cold (CA) (5
   degrees C) or thermoneutrality (TN) (25 degrees C). The animals were
   then examined under three equal 4-day periods: ad libitum feeding,
   fasting and re-feeding. Through the analysis of daily as well as
   short-term, or ultradian, variations of body temperature, we showed that
   while ducklings at TN show only a modest decline in daily
   thermoregulatory parameters when fasted, they exhibit reduced surface
   temperatures from key sites of vascular heat exchange during fasting.
   The CA birds, on the other hand, significantly reduced their short-term
   variations of body temperature while increasing long-term variability
   when fasting. This phenomenon would allow the CA birds to reduce the
   energetic cost of body temperature maintenance under fasting. By
   analysing ultradian regulation of body temperature, we describe a means
   by which an endotherm appears to lower thermoregulatory costs in
   response to the combined stressors of cold and fasting.

AB In temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) species, offspring
   sex-ratio is dependent on the environmental temperature. For oviparous
   sauropsid species, temperature within the nest influences gonadal sexual
   differentiation during a small window of embryogenesis called the
   thermosensitive period (TSP).
   The absence of sexual dimorphic characteristic in juveniles of TSD
   species coupled with the lack of a non-invasive method to determine sex
   is a great obstacle to studies estimating sex-ratios under natural
   conditions. Some authors have proposed proxies of sex-ratio obtained
   through correlative approaches. They commonly extrapolate the empirical
   profile of sex-ratios as a function of constant incubation temperature
   established for several species in the laboratory to a field context.
   However, most of these proxies have been refuted by studies realized
   under field conditions, and consequently they cannot be used to predict
   sex-ratio under natural conditions.
   Here, we propose a new thermal model of TSD using a mechanistic
   approach. We built this model from a collection of published data of
   physiological processes (i.e. the growth of the embryo, the growth of
   gonads and the activity of the enzyme aromatase) underlying the TSD
   mechanism, for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). This new
   approach provides integration of incubation temperature fluctuations, as
   well as the cumulative and differential effect of high and low
   temperatures on sexual differentiation to embryo sex determination.
   The significant consistency obtained between observed and predicted
   sex-ratios both at diverse constant and fluctuating incubation
   temperatures provides hope to develop an efficient method to predict
   sex-ratio under natural conditions. The reliable validity of this new
   model could have wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the
   TSD mechanism, as well as its evolutionary and ecological consequences
   in natural populations.

AB It is shown that in the area of sandy steppe in a nature reserve
   "Dnieper-Orelsky" the soil temperature has been changed from 17.2 to
   31.0 degrees C. Loci with higher temperatures are on the left and right
   ends of the landfill, whereas the plot with lower temperature was
   located in the central region. There is a tendency of spatial
   variability of soil temperature, which could be explained by vegetation
   location and edaphic characteristics. We calculated the indicators of
   spatial dependence and the radius of influence with the help of
   geostatistical method and proved that the target plot had high degree of
   spatial dependence. It was established that the spatial variability of
   soil temperature is associated with vegetation and other soil
   characteristics within the studied plot. Woody plants, geophytes, and
   the number of roots have a negative correlation with all the studied
   parameters. A positive correlation was calculated for soil temperature
   and hemycryptophytes, terophytes, and hamephytes. The soil temperature
   has negative correlation with the humidity, whereas the soil density is
   positively correlated with soil temperature.

AB Extreme climatic events, including heat waves (HWs) and severe storms,
   influence the structure of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite
   growing consensus that anthropogenic climate change will increase the
   frequency, duration and magnitude of extreme events, current
   understanding of their impact on communities and ecosystems is limited.
   Here, we used sessile invertebrates on settlement panels as model
   assemblages to examine the influence of HW magnitude, duration and
   timing on marine biodiversity patterns. Settlement panels were deployed
   in a marina in southwest UK for >= 5 weeks, to allow sufficient time for
   colonisation and development of sessile fauna, before being subjected to
   simulated HWs in a mesocosm facility. Replicate panel assemblages were
   held at ambient sea temperature (similar to 17 degrees C), or +3 degrees
   C or +5 degrees C for a period of 1 or 2 weeks, before being returned to
   the marina for a recovery phase of 2-3 weeks. The 10-week experiment was
   repeated 3 times, staggered throughout summer, to examine the influence
   of HW timing on community impacts. Contrary to our expectations, the
   warming events had no clear, consistent impacts on the abundance of
   species or the structure of sessile assemblages. With the exception of 1
   high-magnitude long-durationHWevent, warming did not alter not
   assemblage structure, favour non-native species, nor lead to changes in
   richness, abundance or biomass of sessile faunal assemblages. The
   observed lack of effect may have been caused by a combination of (1) the
   use of relatively low magnitude, realistic heat wave treatments compared
   to previous studies (2), the greater resilience of mature adult sessile
   fauna compared to recruits and juveniles, and (3) the high thermal
   tolerance of the model organisms (i.e., temperate fouling species,
   principally bryozoans and ascidians). Our study demonstrates the
   importance of using realistic treatments when manipulating climate
   change variables, and also suggests that biogeographical context may
   influence community-level responses to short-term warming events, which
   are predicted to increase in severity in the future.

AB Growth rates of larval cod Gadus morhua and haddock Melanogrammus
   aeglefinus were estimated based on collections in winter and spring of
   1995 and 1996 during the US Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC)
   Georges Bank Program. Growth was determined using length-at-age data
   derived from otolith increments to indicate age in days from hatching.
   Growth varied significantly among months and between 1995 and 1996. In
   general, cod growth exceeded 0.2 mm d(-1) and reached a maximum growth
   rate of 0.7 mm d(-1) in May 1996. Haddock growth was also greater than
   0.2 mm d(-1) with a peak of 0.5 mm d(-1) in June 1995. For cod,
   instantaneous growth rates of 3.3 to 3.5% V were higher than those
   published previously for the Georges Bank region. Haddock growth was
   comparable to that of cod in 1995 (3.3% d(-1)), but a higher growth rate
   for haddock (3.5% d(-1)) in 1996 was probably due to an
   under-representation of larger sizes in the data available. Increased
   size-at-age was associated with higher temperatures for both species;
   however, the effect of temperature on growth appears to have decreased
   in May as temperatures exceeded 6degreesC and approached 8degreesC.
   Insufficient numbers of larvae of either species were available in May
   of 1996 for a similar analysis; however, cod growth during May 1996 was
   the most rapid observed in this study (0.7 mm d(-1)). This corresponded
   to a period of high production of suitable food organisms, early stage
   Calanus finmarchicus, in May 1996 resulting from cooler winter
   temperatures and late warming after the winter of 1996, suggesting that
   cooler temperatures favor a prolonged period of food production for
   larvae and better conditions for growth late in the larval period.

AB The endoparasitic nematophagous fungus, Esteya vermicola, has shown
   great potential as a biological control agent against the pine wood
   nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Fluctuating culture temperatures
   can affect fungal yields and fungal tolerance to desiccation, UV
   radiation, H2O2, and heat stress, as well as antioxidase expression. To
   explore these effects, E. vermicola cultured under five temperature
   ranges, 26 degrees C, 15-26 degrees C, 26-35 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C,
   and 15-35 degrees C, were compared. The cultures grown at lower
   temperatures showed better growth, stronger tolerance to desiccation,
   UV, and H2O2 stresses, and increased catalase expression, However, these
   cultures also showed weaker heat stress tolerance and lower superoxide
   dismutase expression than the higher-temperature cultures. In
   particular, the E. vermicola cultured at 20-30 degrees C, i.e.,
   fluctuating in a narrow range around the optimal temperature, showed the
   best performance. Therefore, for production in practical applications,
   this narrowly fluctuating, moderate temperature appears to be optimal
   for yield and stress tolerance in E. vermicola.

   On the other hand the PO3-P uptake rate under high initial concentration
   at temperatures 20 degrees C and 20 +/- 2 degrees C were lower than
   other conditions after 15 days. After the third day, NO3-N and PO4-P
   were exhausted from the medium when the initial concentration were low

   observed at temperatures 15 degrees C and 15 +/- 2 degrees C decreased

   25 +/- 2 degrees C increased from beginning. We concluded that

AB Vertebrate ectotherms may deal with changes of environmental
   temperatures by behavioral and/or physiological mechanisms. Reptiles
   inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily
   temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with
   altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation
   in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest
   altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from
   elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental
   temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum
   temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of
   individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus
   exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental
   temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit
   intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations,
   tended to the "static" side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum.
   The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely
   plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions
   from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of
   the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest
   altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our
   study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal
   ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics
   that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards
   than previously thought.

AB The effects of fire on the vegetation vary across continents. However,
   in Neotropical fire-prone grasslands, the relationship between fire and
   seed germination is still poorly understood, while their regeneration,
   especially after strong anthropogenic disturbance, is challenging for
   their conservation. In the present study, we assessed diversity of
   germination strategies in 15 dominant herbaceous species from
   Neotropical altitudinal grasslands (locally known as campos rupestres).
   We exposed seeds to several fire-related treatments. We also compared
   germination between regularly and post-fire fruiting species. Finally,
   we investigated the diversity of dormancy classes aiming at better
   understanding the biogeography and phylogeny of seed dormancy.
   Germination strategies varied among families. Velloziaceae and
   Xyridaceae produced non-dormant, fast-germinating seeds. Cyperaceae and
   Poaceae showed an extremely low or null germination due to a high
   proportion of unviable or embryo-less seeds. The seeds of campo rupestre
   grasslands are fire resistant, but there is no evidence that fire
   triggers germination in this fire-prone ecosystem. Although heat and
   charred wood did not promote germination, smoke enhanced germination in
   one grass species and decreased the mean germination time and improved
   synchrony in Xyridaceae and Velloziaceae. Fire had a positive effect on
   post-fire regeneration by stimulating fruit set in some Cyperaceae and
   Poaceae species. These species produced faster germinating seeds with
   higher germination percentage and synchrony compared to regularly
   fruiting Cyperaceae and Poaceae species. This strategy of dispersion and
   regeneration seems to be an alternative to the production of seeds with
   germination triggered by fire. Physiological dormancy is reported for
   the first time in several clades of Neotropical plants. Our data help
   advance the knowledge on the role of fire in the regeneration of
   Neotropical grasslands.

AB While ectothermic organisms often experience considerable circadian
   variation in body temperature under natural conditions, the study of the
   effects of temperature on metabolic rates are traditionally based on
   subjecting animals to constant temperature regimes. Whether data
   resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts
   temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes
   remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting
   metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus)
   under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of
   temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25
   degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes
   with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between
   thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate
   measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at
   the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature.
   Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on
   rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our
   results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial
   attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over
   functional traits. Such approach provides a more solid support for
   inferences about temperature effects on the life history, ecology and
   conservation of ectothermic organisms.

AB Background: Temperature variability (TV) is a potential trigger for
   death in urban areas, but there is little evidence of this in rural
   areas. In addition, a typical TV index only considers the temporal
   variability of temperature and ignores its spatial variability, which
   should be considered due to the effects of human mobility. Here this
   study aimed to 1) develop a novel spatiotemporal TV index accounting for
   human mobility; and 2) based on this index, explore the urban-rural
   differences in TV-mortality associations in China.
   Methods: We collected daily data on fine-gridded hourly temperatures and
   >2 million deaths that occurred in Zhejiang province, China from 2009 to
   2015. A spatiotemporal TV index was developed by calculating the
   standard deviation of the hourly temperatures from multi-site records
   over the course of several exposure days. A three-stage analysis was
   performed to estimate the mortality risks and mortality burdens of TV.
   Stratified analyses were performed by cause-specific mortality,
   urban/rural district, age and gender.
   Results: Significant associations were found between TV and all types of
   targeted diseases, age groups, and genders. Percentage increase
   inmortality associated with a 1 degrees C increase in TV at 0-7 exposure
   days were found to be higher for rural dwellers than urban dwellers in
   the warm season [ for all-cause mortality, 2.07% (95% CI: 1.49%, 2.64%)
   vs. 1.16% (95% CI: 0.70%, 1.62%)]. An estimated all-causemortality
   fraction of 5.33% was attributable to TV, with 4.99% in urban areas and
   6.02% in rural areas. The elderly (aged 65+years) and females were more
   sensitive to TV than young people and males, respectively.
   Conclusions: A spatiotemporal TV index was developed, considering both
   the temporal and spatial variability of temperatures. TV is an
   independent health risk factor. In China, rural areas generally suffer
   greater TV-related mortality risks than urban areas in the warm season.
   Our findings have important implications for developing area-, cause-,
   and group-specific adaptation strategies and emergency planning to
   reduce TV-related mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming is predicted to cause large-scale extinctions,
   particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference between
   tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical species experience a
   mean habitat temperature that is closer to the temperature at which
   fitness is maximized (T-opt) and an upper temperature limit for survival
   (T-max) that is closer to T-opt than do temperate species. Thus, even a
   small increase in environmental temperature could put tropical
   ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate ectotherms have
   a wider temperature cushion. Although this pattern is widely observed,
   the mechanisms that produce it are not well understood. Here we develop
   a mathematical framework to partition the temperature response of
   fitness into its components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and
   test model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness
   declines at high temperatures because the temperature responses of
   fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways: fecundity decreases with
   temperature when temperatures exceed the optimal range, whereas
   mortality continues to increase. The proximity of T-opt to T-max depends
   on how the temperature response of development mediates the interaction
   between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly temperature
   sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only after fecundity has
   started to decline with temperature, which causes fitness to decline
   rapidly to zero when temperatures exceed T-opt. The model correctly
   predicts empirically observed fitness-temperature relationships in
   insects from different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the
   widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the
   latitudinal differences in fitness responses.

AB Bactrocera latifrons (Hendel) is believed to have originated in
   Southeast Asia but has invaded Hawaii and most recently East Africa.
   This insect has also been recorded on Okinawa Island, the far south of
   Kyushu Island, Japan. To assess the overwintering ability of B.
   latifrons adults, survival at constant temperatures (8, 10, 12, 14, 15 A
   degrees C) and under fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs) was
   investigated. At 14 or 15 A degrees C, more than 30 % of females
   survived for 90 days. Time required to kill 95 % of B. latifrons at 8 A
   degrees C was estimated to be 13 days; at 10 A degrees C, 29 days; and
   at 12 A degrees C, 38 days for females, and 8, 17, and 24 days at the
   same above temperatures, respectively, for males, suggesting low cold
   tolerance of this species. The results show that females survive cold
   temperatures better than males. Under an FTR of 11 A degrees C (22 h)/20
   A degrees C (2 h) (average 11.8 A degrees C) survival of females
   drastically increased compared to that at a constant temperature of 12 A
   degrees C, whereas the survival of males increased slightly. Survival
   under FTRs indicates that adult B. latifrons may not overwinter in the
   north of Tanegashima Island, located 30 km south of Kyushu Island,
   Japan.

   temporal temperature profiles which typically occur in SSF due to heat
   transfer limitations. Analysis with a modified two-phase growth model
   suggests that the temperature upshift causes a 48% decrease in the
   number of actively extending hyphal rips, and that the first order death
   rate constant of tips increases from 0.059 to 0.073 h(-1). The fungus
   did not im mediately recover when the temperature was returned to 37
   degrees C. The model assumed that the specific growth rate constant

   contradictory data was obtained from radial growth rate experiments. (C)

AB The antipredator behavior diel vertical migration (DVM), common in
   aquatic keystone species Daphnia, involves daily migration from warmer
   surface waters before dawn to cooler deeper waters after dusk.
   Plasticity in Daphnia DVM behavior optimizes fitness via trade-offs
   between growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migration behavior
   is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light,
   predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difficult to
   determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this
   behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically
   significant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia
   pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations;
   (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia
   vertical migration; and (3) defining how two anthropogenic stressors
   (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior.
   Simulated natural lake stratification were constructed in 8 L (0.5 m
   tall, 14.5 cm wide) water columns to monitor under controlled laboratory
   conditions the individual effects of temperature gradients, depth, and
   metal stressors on Daphnia vertical migration. Three major findings are
   reported. First, while no difference in thermal preference was found
   among the four populations studied, within lake populations variability
   among isolates was high. Second, decoupling temperature and depth
   revealed that depth was a better predictor of Daphnia migratory patterns
   over temperature. Third, exposure to environmentally relevant
   concentrations of copper or nickel inhibited classic DVM behavior. These
   findings revealed the high variability in thermal preference found
   within Daphnia populations, elucidated the individual roles that depth
   and temperature have on migratory behavior, and showed how copper and
   nickel can interfere with the natural response of Daphnia to fish
   predator cues. Thus contributing to the body of knowledge necessary to
   predict how natural populations of Daphnia will be affected by climate
   related changes in lake temperatures and increased presence of
   anthropogenic stressors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Temperature is crucial for reptiles, also during embryonic development,
   particularly for species with temperature-dependent sex determination.
   Under natural conditions, Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) eggs
   are influenced by thermal changes in the interior of the nest related to
   the external environmental temperature. As nests are subject to
   variations in temperature and most lab studies on crocodilian incubation
   have been carried out at constant temperatures, we were interested in
   determining how temperature fluctuations may affect the development of
   caiman embryos. We investigated the effects of incubation at constant
   temperatures (31 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 33 degrees C) and
   fluctuating temperatures (31 +/- 2, 32 +/- 1, and 32 +/- 2 degrees C) on
   the following aspects: incubation period duration, hatching success, sex
   ratio, total length, and body mass of C. latirostris hatchlings. Eggs
   incubated at 31 degrees C produced 100% females, those at 32 degrees C
   produced 71.6% females (however, the sex ratio was nest related), and at
   33 degrees C produced 100% males. We found a masculinizing effect when
   incubation was at 31 +/- 2 degrees C compared with a constant 31 degrees
   C; and temperature fluctuations at 32 degrees C (32 +/- 1 and 32 +/- 2
   degrees C) had a negative effect on hatchlings size and mass, and
   hatching success compared with constant incubation temperatures of 32
   degrees C and 33 degrees C. Finally, the effect of temperature variation
   during the incubation period on sex ratio, hatching success, and
   phenotype depends on the mean temperature, as the fluctuation around 31
   degrees C affected the sex ratios and incubation period, and the
   fluctuation around 32 degrees C affected hatchling success and size.

AB Physiological plasticity allows organisms to respond to diverse
   conditions. However, can being too plastic actually be detrimental?
   Malagasy common tenrecs, Tenrec ecaudatus, have many plesiomorphic
   traits and may represent a basal placental mammal. We established a
   laboratory population of T. ecaudatus and found extreme plasticity in
   thermoregulation and metabolism, a novel hibernation form, variable
   annual timing, and remarkable growth and reproductive biology. For
   instance, tenrec body temperature (T-b) may approximate ambient
   temperature to as low as 12 degrees C even when tenrecs are fully
   active. Conversely, tenrecs can hibernate with Tb of 28 degrees C.
   During the active season, oxygen consumption may vary 25-fold with
   little or no change in T-b. During the austral winter, tenrecs are
   consistently torpid but the depth of torpor may vary. A righting assay
   revealed that T-b contributes to but does not dictate activity status.
   Homeostatic processes are not always linked, e.g. a hibernating tenrec
   experienced a similar to 34% decrease in heart rate while maintaining
   constant body temperature and oxygen consumption rates. Tenrec growth
   rates vary but young may grow similar to 40-fold in the 5 weeks until
   weaning and may possess indeterminate growth as adults. Despite all of
   this profound plasticity, tenrecs are surprisingly intolerant of
   extremes in ambient temperature (<8 or >34 degrees C). We contend that
   while plasticity may confer numerous energetic advantages in
   consistently moderate environments, environmental extremes may have
   limited the success and distribution of plastic basal mammals.

AB In many animals, temperatures experienced by developing embryos
   determine offspring sex (e.g. temperature-dependent sex determination,
   TSD), but most studies focus strictly on the effects of mean
   temperature, with little emphasis on the importance of thermal
   fluctuations. In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an
   Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate
   that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but
   not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated
   eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and
   three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is
   determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters.
   Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing
   directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect
   inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that
   TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under
   genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important
   considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms,
   for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of
   TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change
   scenarios.

AB What is unique to biodynamics in vivo or dynamics leading to the
   emergence of biological organizations is a frozen aggregate of degrees
   of freedom in motion that can change its constituent members in time.
   Association and dissociation of degrees of freedom in the frozen
   aggregate is information-generative, in the sense that their realization
   proceeds in a contingent manner, with no unique pattern being
   predetermined. In particular, dissociation of some of the degrees of
   freedom from the parental aggregate becomes information-generative when
   the dissociative interaction initiated by thermal agitation originating
   in the ambient takes significantly longer time than the interval of the
   inverse thermal frequency. For instance, ATP hydrolysis with the help of
   myosin following the preceding association of an ATP molecule with the
   myosin happens to be a case of such a dissociative interaction, in which
   the duration of the interaction is far greater than the inverse of
   thermal frequency. One dominant mode of biodynamics in vivo is to
   effectively materialize a heat engine by preparing a local region with a
   temperature lower than that of the surroundings, thereby letting the
   duration time of the dissociative interaction be far greater than the
   inverse of thermal frequency. Evolutionary emergence of most primitive
   biological organizations would coincide with a de novo appearance of a
   heat engine that could hold thermal agitations from the surroundings
   locally there and could act upon the latter accordingly. (C) 1997

AB Climate change is threatening the productivity of cereal crops and
   creating food insecurity issues worldwide. To assess the impacts of
   thermal variations on yield and quality of maize, two years field study
   was conducted during 2014 and 2015. Four maize hybrids were sown in
   spring season at ten planting dates with fifteen days interval between
   each planting date. Results revealed that late planted maize in the
   month of March to onward in spring faced significant decline in yield
   (10-40%) and quality (10-50%) due to higher temperatures, whereas early
   sown maize (15th and 30th January) showed better results in terms of
   grain quality and yield related traits. Yield and quality attributes
   showed a strong relationship with seasonal thermal variations with
   reliable R-2 values ranged from 0.80 to 0.95. In conclusion, thermal
   variations at different sowing dates caused yield decline and quality
   deterioration in spring maize However, maize hybrids P-1543 and DK-6103
   resulted in higher yield return and better quality when sown earlier at
   end of January in spring. (C) 2019 Friends Science Publishers

AB Recently developed single molecule measurements have demonstrated that
   the mechanisms for numerous protein functions involve thermal
   fluctuation, or Brownian motion. Protein interactions bias the random
   thermal noise in a manner such that the protein can perform its given
   functions. This phenomenon has been observed in molecular motor
   unidirectional movement where Brownian motion is used to preferentially
   bind the motor heads in one direction causing directional motility. This
   is analogous to that used by proteins in which spontaneous structural
   fluctuations are used to switch function. Seeing that two very different
   systems implement similar mechanisms suggests there exists a general
   scheme applied by diverse proteins that exploits thermal fluctuations in
   order to achieve their respective functions. (C) 2008 Published by

AB Thermal performance curves (TPCs), which quantify how an ectotherm's
   body temperature (T-b) affects its performance or fitness, are often
   used in an attempt to predict organismal responses to climate change.
   Here, we examine the key - but often biologically unreasonable -
   assumptions underlying this approach; for example, that physiology and
   thermal regimes are invariant over ontogeny, space and time, and also
   that TPCs are independent of previously experienced T-b. We show how a
   critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically
   useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than
   assuming that TPCs are fixed during ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for
   each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-specific
   ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable
   to climate change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the
   assumptions underlying the integration of TPCs with T-b, to develop a
   framework within which empiricists can place their work within these
   limitations, and to facilitate the application of thermal physiology to
   understanding the biological implications of climate change.

AB The common bream, Abramis brama (L) in Kortowskie Lake (north-eastern
   Poland) usually spawn when the water temperature during the late spring
   rises to 20 degrees C. The optimal water temperature for embryonic
   development of this population is 21 degrees C However, in some cases,
   the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much
   higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim
   of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning
   effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive
   effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal
   fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the
   natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream
   spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds
   and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C)
   temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and
   the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The
   period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in
   different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second
   year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the
   study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break
   in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the
   spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos
   and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation. (C) 2013

AB The survival of seedlings in temperate climate habitats depends on both
   temporal and spatial factors. The interaction between an internal seed
   dormancy mechanism and the ruling environmental conditions allows
   accurate cueing of germination. We analysed how environmental signals
   interact in seeds of temperate forest pioneer species, increasing the
   seeds chances of germinating in the right place at the right time.
   Digitalis purpurea and Scrophularia nodosa are two small-seeded
   herbaceous species that typically grow in vegetation gaps in European
   temperate forests. Seeds of both species are partially dormant at the
   time of dispersal in summer. This primary dormancy is released in autumn
   and early winter, resulting in a minimal level of physiological dormancy
   by late winter and early spring. We observed that physiological dormancy
   was induced again in seeds exhumed in late spring and in summer.
   Experiments in laboratory conditions revealed that primary dormancy in
   seeds of S similar to nodosa was broken by cold stratification, whereas
   primary dormancy in D.similar to purpurea seeds was broken by both a
   cold and a warm stratification. The two species differed in their
   response to the tested gap-detection signals, as light was the most
   important factor stimulating germination of D.similar to purpurea, and
   seeds of S.similar to nodosa germinated best when subjected to daily
   fluctuating temperatures. This study clearly indicates that the ability
   to germinate in response to gap-detection signals changes seasonally in
   temperate forest pioneers. Additionally, seeds of both species responded
   differently to these environmental signals, probably reflecting
   differences in the regeneration niche.

AB In the maritime Antarctic, terrestrial arthropods have recourse to two
   strategies to mitigate low summer temperatures: (1) physiological
   plasticity and (2) avoidance via microhabitat insulation. This study
   investigated the interaction between these strategies in the springtail,
   Cryptopygus antarcticus, established in situ within contrasting
   microcosms (buffered vs. exposed) and within two sets of habitat
   simulations (wet vs. dry) over diurnal scales through the Antarctic
   summer. Significant differences were found in the cold hardiness of
   springtails sampled simultaneously from each microcosm. Exposed animals
   showed greater plasticity in the "true" austral summer, but as field
   temperatures declined preceding the onset of winter, buffered animals
   showed greater resilience. Overall, water was found to inhibit the
   buffering effect of moss and there was a significantly greater
   discrimination between buffered and exposed microcosms in the dry
   treatment. Analysis of microhabitat temperatures indicate that it is
   thermal variability not lower temperature that is responsible for the
   greater plasticity of exposed animals.

AB For many oviparous animals, incubation temperature influences sex
   through temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Although climate
   change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods
   predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on
   mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing
   methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the
   probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach
   subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by
   integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent
   reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used
   method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent
   (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new
   approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We
   experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM
   method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the
   variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the
   PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests
   over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM
   approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD,
   particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate
   change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up
   to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting
   that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our
   data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles
   possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.

AB The growth of pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella
   spp., and Listeria monocytogenes on iceberg lettuce under constant and
   fluctuating temperatures was modelled in order to estimate the microbial
   safety of this vegetable during distribution from the farm to the table.
   Firstly, we examined pathogen growth on lettuce at constant
   temperatures, ranging from 5 to 25 degrees C, and then we obtained the
   growth kinetic parameters (lag time, maximum growth rate (mu max), and
   maximum population density (MPD)) using the Baranyi primary growth
   model. The parameters were similar to those predicted by the pathogen
   modelling program (PMP), with the exception of MPD. The MPD of each
   pathogen on lettuce was 2-4 log(10) CFU/g lower than that predicted by
   PMP. Furthermore, the MPD of pathogens decreased with decreasing
   temperature. The relationship between root mu(max). and temperature was
   linear in accordance with Ratkowsky secondary model as was the
   relationship between the MPD and temperature. Predictions of pathogen
   growth under fluctuating temperature used the Baranyi primary microbial
   growth model along with the Ratkowsky secondary model and MPD equation.
   The fluctuating temperature profile used in this study was the real
   temperature history measured during distribution from the field at
   harvesting to the retail store. Overall predictions for each pathogen
   agreed well with observed viable counts in most cases. The bias and root
   mean square error (RMSE) of the prediction were small. The prediction in
   which mu(max) was based on PMP showed a trend of overestimation relative
   to prediction based on lettuce. However, the prediction concerning E.
   coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. on lettuce greatly overestimated growth
   in the case of a temperature history starting relatively high, such as
   25 degrees C for 5 h. In contrast, the overall prediction of L.
   monocytogenes under the same circumstances agreed with the observed
   data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1 Drosophila suzukiiMatsumura (Diptera) is a polyphagous herbivore
   native to East Asia that develops in cultivated and wild fruits. In
   2011, it appeared in Germany. In 2012, economic damage was recorded and,
   in 2014, the harvest of stone and soft fruits was lost in some regions.
   By contrast, during 2015, populations remained lower. Record
   temperatures and dryness might have impeded population growth during
   that year.
   2 To test this hypothesis, flies were exposed to a 4-day simulation. We
   evaluated the effect of fluctuating temperature and humidity on
   mortality and reproduction of D. suzukii from three age classes (average
   age: class 1: 3days; class 2: 11days; class 3: 20days). Maximum
   temperatures were 27, 33 and 39 degrees C. Relative humidity oscillated
   between 18% and 85%.
   3 Fly mortality through heat stress ranged from 50% to 80%. Higher rates
   died of oldest flies and females. Offspring per female did not differ
   between heat stressed and control groups.
   4 Flies of both sexes were not sterilized through heat and dryness.
   Prior acclimation reduced any negative effects.
   5 We concluded that heat waves and extreme dryness during 2015 were one
   cause of the low population densities of D. suzukii observed under field
   conditions.

AB We present a method to characterize variable thermal regimes in terms of
   an equivalent or effective temperature. Our method is based on a first
   order exponential transformation of a time series of temperatures to
   yield an exponentially-weighted mean temperature characteristic of the
   regime and independent of any particular species or end point. The
   resulting effective temperature or exponential mean, 7, offers an
   improved method for summarizing mean temperature where biological
   response scales exponentially to temperature. The exponential mean
   allows growth under varying thermal regimes to be predicted using
   constant temperature models and offers a compact descriptor
   communicating the growth capacity of variable thermal regimes. The
   method combines mathematical simplicity with translatability to
   different Q10 values without recourse to the underlining time series
   data. It also provides a quantitative baseline that improves on mean
   temperature by incorporating the effect of Jensen's inequality and it
   remains applicable at near zero temperatures where thermal sums lack
   accuracy.

   skin temperature fluctuations caused by periodic changes in blood flow
   resulting from oscillations in vasomotor smooth muscle tone. We
   considered two cases, one in which temperature measurements and blood
   flow recordings by laser Doppler flowmetry are made simultaneously and
   another in which two temperature signals are measured concurrently.
   Twelve healthy subjects participated ill our study. The gapped wave let
   technique was used to suppress artifacts caused by boundary effects.
   Simultaneous; recordings of skin temperature fluctuations and the signal
   of the laser Doppler flowmeter provided correlation coefficients
   essentially exceeding the values obtained for noise signals within three
   spectral ranges corresponding to myogenic (0.05-0.14 Hz). neurogenic
   (0.02-0.05 Hz), and endothelial (0.0095-0.02 Hz) regulation mechanisms.
   Within the frequency range from 0.14 to 2 Hz the values of the
   correlation function are compatible with the values of noise
   correlations. The same results were obtained for two concurrently
   measured temperature signals. Reduction in the amplitude of temperature
   fluctuations and in the level of correlations with the frequency arises
   because the skin has the properties of a low-frequency filter. As
   temperature fluctuations propagate their amplitude decays as an
   exponential function of frequency. Hence skin oscillations in the
   spectral range reflecting the influence of heartbeat and respiration
   cannot be distinguished from external thermal noise.

AB A striking pattern, seen in both fossil and extant taxa, is that
   tropical ectotherms are better at invading temperate habitats than vice
   versa. This is puzzling because tropical ectotherms, being thermal
   specialists, face a harsher abiotic environment and competition from
   temperate residents that are thermal generalists. We develop a
   mathematical framework to address this puzzle. We find that (i) tropical
   ectotherms can invade temperate habitats if they have higher consumption
   rates and lower mortality during warmer summers, (ii) stronger seasonal
   fluctuations at higher latitudes create more temporal niches, allowing
   coexistence of tropical invaders and temperate residents, and (iii)
   temperate ectotherms' failure to invade tropical habitats is due to
   greater mortality rather than lower competitive ability. Our framework
   yields predictions about population-level outcomes of invasion success
   based solely on species' trait responses to temperature. It provides a

AB Ocean temperature changes between 1991 and 2005 in the eastern Tasman
   Sea were analysed. This area was chosen because of a combination of data
   availability, low mesoscale variability and because of its importance in
   determining the climate of the downwind New Zealand landmass. A large
   warming extending to the full depth of the water column (c. 800 m) was
   found to have occurred between 1996 and 2002. This warming was seen in
   measurements by expendable bathythermographs and also in satellite sea
   surface temperature and sea surface height products, and has a clear
   impact on New Zealand's terrestrial temperature. The nature of the
   wan-ning is discussed, together with likely forcing mechanisms. No local
   forcing mechanisms are consistent with the observed warming, leading to
   the conclusion that the signal seen in the Tasman Sea is part of a
   larger South Pacific-wide phenomenon.

AB The effect of temperature variability on laying birds was studied
   experimentally, using Japanese quail. Two aspects of temperature
   variability were investigated: the effects of regular daily variation in
   temperature, and of a sudden change in temperature. Both of these may
   become more common as a consequence of climate change. These
   manipulations were carried out at two levels of food supply. Energy
   expenditure increased with higher daily temperature variation, and also
   after a sudden change in temperature, taking several days to settle to a
   constant level. Manipulating daily temperature variation also resulted
   in smaller eggs being laid under more variable temperatures, when food
   quality was also low. The results demonstrate that day-to-day variation
   in temperature, as well as mean temperature, affects energy expenditure,
   which can have consequences for egg production.

AB Internal ice formation leads to wholesale changes in ionic, osmotic and
   pH homeostasis, energy metabolism, and mechanical damage, across a small
   range of temperatures, and is thus an abiotic stressor that acts at a
   distinct, physiologically relevant, threshold. Insects that experience
   repeated freeze-thaw cycles over winter will cross this stressor
   threshold many times over their lifespan. Here, we examined the effect
   of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term
   physiological parameters (metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant
   concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance
   (survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly,
   Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed overwintering prepupae to a series of
   low temperatures (-10, -15 or -20 degrees C) with increasing numbers of
   freezing events (3, 6 or 10) with differing recovery periods between
   events (1, 5 or 10 days). Repeated freezing increased sorbitol
   concentration by about 50% relative to a single freezing episode, and
   prompted prepupae to modify long-chain triacylglycerols to acetylated
   triacylglycerols. Long-term, repeated freezing did not significantly
   reduce survival but did reduce egg production by 9.8% relative to a
   single freezing event. Exposure temperature did not affect any of these
   measures, suggesting that threshold crossing events may be more
   important to fitness than the intensity of stress in overwintering E.
   solidaginis.

AB The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends
   on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as
   on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through
   phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity
   induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature
   regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance
   traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a
   constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating
   temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among
   all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both
   temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat
   tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating
   thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant
   environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when
   developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our
   surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing
   environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to
   flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably
   changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition,
   resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even
   though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the
   predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress
   resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be
   the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting,
   indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the
   predictability of the environment.

   the basis of the discrete-continuum approach presented in Schmidt and
   Fraternali (J Mech Phys Solids 60:172-180, 2012). We test the proposed

AB This article analyzes the variations of the temperature recorded in a
   tidal pool near the half-tide level, in a semilunadian regimen. A model
   of the temperature variations of the pool, based on diffusional exchange
   with the sea at high tide and with the air at low tide, shows good
   agreement with the experimental results. Fourier transform analysis of
   the variations of the main components of the frequency spectrum during a
   lunar cycle and for different values of the parameters (temperature
   variations of the air, level ofthe pool relative to the tide, exchange
   coefficients with the air and the ocean) reveals a complex structure.
   When the tidal component exists, it is stable in power and frequency,
   but is, in most cases, much smaller than the diel peak. Baning the
   situations when the tide does not reach the pool for several days, the
   period of the pool is equal to 24.8 h (the first subharmonic ofthe tidal
   frequency), except for the part ofthe lunar cycle during which the high
   tide corresponds approximately to the extrema of air temperature: Then
   the period is lower than 24 h and the power decreases. Overall, the mean
   period is 24 h, which is coherent with the fact that the driving force
   ofthe temperature variations is the sun, while its input in the pool is
   modulated by the tide. The same results can be applied, with a lesser
   amplitude ofthe temperature variations, to larger bodies ofwater. From
   these results, it is difficult to decide whether the temperature
   variations constitute a zeitgeber for circadian or circatidal clocks.
   The present conclusion is that this parameter seems to be, at best, a
   very unreliable synchronizer.

AB Social insects depend on their nests for protection against predation
   and abiotic threats. Accordingly, the chemical compounds present in the
   material wasps use to build their nests can both facilitate
   communication and repel predators. It is herein hypothesized that
   different wasp species build their nests with different structure and
   substrate materials and that such materials consist of chemical
   compounds related to unique wasp behavior and outside temperature
   variation. To test this hypothesis, nests were collected from three
   species of social wasps, the samples of which were subjected to
   temperature variation under laboratory conditions. The compounds present
   in the substrate were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass
   spectrometry. Chemical compounds identified in the nest material of the
   three species responded differently to temperature variation. Chemical
   compounds from Polybia nests were altered significantly when subjected
   to temperature variation, whereas the nests of Polistes versicolor did
   not significantly change in relation to the control. The differences
   found between Polistes and Polybia nests may be related to genetic
   factors, but also to the type of nest they construct. It is possible
   that divergent evolutionary strategies for maintaining colony
   temperature, as a function of the chemical composition of the nests, may
   have appeared between wasps that have open and closed nests. In
   relatively small colonies, nest substrate is more resistant to
   temperature variation because it is composed of a greater diversity of
   elements and thus capable of holding heavier, longer carbon chains. Our
   results suggest that chemical compounds in the nest material of the
   three wasp species analysed responded differently to fluctuating ambient
   temperatures and that such variation could result from the biochemical
   differences of unique wasp species or from thermoregulation strategies
   of colonies.

AB Adaptation, acclimatization and symbiont diversity are known to regulate
   thermal tolerance in corals, but the role of these mechanisms remains
   poorly constrained in other photosymbioses, such as large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs), which are known to bleach at temperatures that are
   likely to be exceeded in the near future. LBFs inhabit a broad range of
   shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance
   have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not
   clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar
   habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this
   end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a
   population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species,
   to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a
   similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test
   groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three
   thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration,
   mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont
   response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were
   measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The
   photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results
   show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different
   habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally
   higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site.
   In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A.
   lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced
   impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont
   performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the
   presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A.
   lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra-
   and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.

AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites is a key process in
   the genesis and maintenance of biological diversity. Whereas
   coevolutionary dynamics show distinct patterns under favourable
   environmental conditions, the effects of more realistic, variable
   conditions are largely unknown. We investigated the impact of a
   fluctuating environment on antagonistic coevolution in experimental
   microcosms of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and lytic phage SBWF2.
   High-frequency temperature fluctuations caused no deviations from
   typical coevolutionary arms race dynamics. However, coevolution was
   stalled during periods of high temperature under intermediate-and
   low-frequency fluctuations, generating temporary coevolutionary cold
   spots. Temperature variation affected population density, providing
   evidence that eco-evolutionary feedbacks act through variable
   bacteria-phage encounter rates. Our study shows that environmental
   fluctuations can drive antagonistic species interactions into and out of
   coevolutionary cold and hot spots. Whether coevolution persists or
   stalls depends on the frequency of change and the environmental optima
   of both interacting players.

AB Subterranean environments are characterized by the quasi absence of
   thermal variations (+/-1 degrees C within a year), and organisms living
   in these biotopes for several millions of years, such as hypogean
   crustaceans, can be expected to have adapted to this very stable
   habitat. As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in
   their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular
   cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed,
   physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are
   proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their
   habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of
   an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a
   high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared
   not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm
   this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N.
   rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10 degrees C all
   year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical
   responses during cold exposure (3 degrees C). These seven populations
   showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were
   accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied
   greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar
   thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be
   established between the amplitude of thermal variations and
   cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in

AB The debate about behavioral thermoregulation inside reptile eggs centers
   on the frequency (and hence, biological significance) of the phenomenon,
   not about its validity. Both sides of the debate agree that large eggs
   in shallow nests laid in sun-exposed soil will experience clines in mean
   temperature and (especially) diel thermal variance; that embryos in the
   middle phase of development have the ability to reposition themselves,
   and room to do so; and that small changes in developmental temperatures
   can influence offspring fitness. Equally, all protagonists agree that
   thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that
   embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in
   development. Based on an array of other fitness-enhancing behaviors
   exhibited by tetrapod embryos, and general principles for recognizing
   adaptation, we conclude that behavioral thermoregulation inside the egg
   likely is adaptive in some but not all reptile species. We identify
   productive directions for empirical research to resolve points of
   contention.

AB Temperature has a strong effect on ectotherm development rate. It is
   therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that
   rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of
   biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development
   stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was
   described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference
   series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age
   (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given
   incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age
   at 20 degrees C. We call this concept "Equivalent Development", as it
   maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given temperature
   to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the laboratory, we
   used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate development rate
   of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant temperatures.
   Using these estimates of development rate, we created a thermal
   performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development (TPCED).
   We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of embryos in
   several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that 85% of the
   variation of development stage in natural nests could be explained.
   Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model based on the
   TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model, where
   development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and the
   amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory
   suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation
   in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We
   suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and
   can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent
   sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent
   Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental
   series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination
   to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating
   temperature.

AB Behavioral adjustments and parental decisions during reproduction can
   influence the thermal environment at nests, yet our understanding into
   how environmental factors (i.e., temperature and precipitation)
   constrain an adults ability to balance self-maintenance and incubation
   demands is limited. To expand our understanding of how species respond
   to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of
   two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinas virginianus] and
   scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern
   Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold
   temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how
   temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments
   (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and
   parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly
   influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in
   sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly
   selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment
   experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation
   and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted
   incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e.,
   morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore,
   successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for
   bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding
   of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for
   developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds
   are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and
   parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations.
   Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively
   modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long
   periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.

AB Studies examining the effects of incubation temperature fluctuation on
   the phenotype of hatchling reptiles have shown species variation. To
   examine whether incubation temperature fluctuation has a key role in
   influencing the phenotype of hatchling Chinese skinks (Plestiodon
   chinensis), we incubated.eggs produced by 20 females under five thermal
   regimes (treatments). Eggs in three treatments were incubated in three
   incubators, one set constant at 27 degrees C and two ramp-programmed at
   27 +/- 3 degrees C and 27 +/- 5 degrees C on a cycle of 12 h (+) and 12
   h (-). The remaining eggs were incubated in two chambers: one inside a
   room where temperatures varied from 23.0 to 31.1 degrees C, with a mean
   of 27.0 degrees C; the other outside the room where temperatures varied
   from 20.2 to 35.3 degrees C, with a mean of 26.1 degrees C. We found
   that: (1) for eggs at a given embryonic stage at ovipositon, the mean
   rather than the variance of incubation temperatures determined the
   length of incubation; (2) most (egg mass, embryonic stage at
   oviposition, incubation length and all examined hatchling traits except
   tail length and locomotor performance) of the examined variables were
   affected by clutch; and (3) body mass was the only hatchling trait that
   differed among the five treatments, but the differences were tiny. These
   findings suggest that incubation temperature fluctuation has no direct
   role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotype in P.
   chinensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Temperature strongly affects performance in ectotherms. As ocean warming
   continues, performance of marine species will be impacted. Many studies
   have focused on how warming will impact physiology, life history, and
   behavior, but few studies have investigated how ecological and
   behavioral traits of organisms will affect their response to changing
   thermal environments. Here, we assessed the thermal tolerances and
   thermal sensitivity of swimming performance of two sympatric mysid
   shrimp species of the Northwest Atlantic. Neomysis americana and
   Heteromysis formosa overlap in habitat and many aspects of their
   ecological niche, but only N. americana exhibits vertical migration. In
   temperate coastal ecosystems, temperature stratification of the water
   column exposes vertical migrators to a wider range of temperatures on a
   daily basis. We found that N. americana had a significantly lower
   critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax).
   However, both mysid species had a buffer of at least 4 degrees C between
   their CTmax and the 100-year projection for mean summer water
   temperatures of 28 degrees C. Swimming performance of the vertically
   migrating species was more sensitive to temperature variation, and this
   species exhibited faster burst swimming speeds. The generalist
   performance curve of H. formosa and specialist curve of N. americana are
   consistent with predictions based on the exposure of each species to
   temperature variation such that higher within-generation variability
   promotes specialization. However, these species violate the assumption
   of the specialist-generalist tradeoff in that the area under their
   performance curves is not constant. Our results highlight the importance
   of incorporating species specific responses to temperature based on the
   ecology and behavior of organisms into climate change prediction models.

AB As thermal regimes change worldwide, projections of future population
   and species persistence often require estimates of how population growth
   rates depend on temperature. These projections rarely account for how
   temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates
   relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested
   the hypothesis that time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating
   thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as
   a consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal performance
   curves (TPCs) describing population growth in fluctuating environments
   can be predicted quantitatively based on TPCs generated in constant
   laboratory conditions. With experimental populations of the green alga
   Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques
   accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth
   rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal
   regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical
   temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton
   species in naturally variable thermal environments. These results
   advance our ability to predict population dynamics in the context of
   global change.

AB The effect of temperature on the biology of Venturia canescens
   (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) is well understood under
   constant temperature conditions, but less so under more natural,
   fluctuating conditions. Herein we studied the influence of fluctuating
   temperatures on biological parameters of V. canescens. Parasitized
   fifth-instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera:
   Pyralidae) were reared individually in incubators at six fluctuating
   temperature regimes (15-19.5 degrees C with a mean of 17.6 degrees C,
   17.5-22.5 degrees C with a mean of 19.8 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C with
   a mean of 22.7 degrees C, 22.5-27.5 degrees C with a mean of 25 degrees
   C, 25.5-32.5 degrees C with a mean of 28.3 degrees C and 28.5-33 degrees
   C with a mean of 30 degrees C) until emergence and death of V. canescens
   adults. Developmental time from parasitism to adult eclosion, adult
   longevity and survival were recorded at each fluctuating temperature
   regime. In principle, developmental time decreased with an increase of
   the mean temperature of the fluctuating temperature regime. Upper and
   lower threshold temperatures for total development were estimated at
   34.9 and 6.7 degrees C, respectively. Optimum temperature for
   development and thermal constant were 28.6 degrees C and 526.3 degree
   days, respectively. Adult longevity was also affected by fluctuating
   temperature, as it was significantly reduced at the highest mean
   temperature (7.0 days at 30 degrees C) compared to the lowest one (29.4
   days at 17.6 degrees C). Survival was low at all tested fluctuating
   temperatures, apart from mean fluctuating temperature of 25 degrees C
   (37%). Understanding the thermal biology of V. canescens under more
   natural conditions is of critical importance in applied contexts. Thus,
   predictions of biological responses to fluctuating temperatures may be
   used in population forecasting models which potentially influence
   decision-making in IPM programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The transcriptional responses of insects to long-term, ecologically
   relevant temperature stress are poorly understood. Long-term exposure to
   low temperatures, commonly referred to as chilling, can lead to
   physiological effects collectively known as chill injury. Periodically
   increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to
   increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible
   for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we
   present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity
   under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering
   post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata)
   were exposed to a constant temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C
   with a daily fluctuation to 20 degrees C. RNA was collected at two
   different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge
   between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified
   differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of
   both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion
   homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were
   up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations
   during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts
   provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures
   protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning
   ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels.
   Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased
   expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and
   neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated
   with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.

AB A prototype system for passive intracranial monitoring using microwave

   cavity to achieve beamforming and focusing, in conjunction with
   sensitive multiband receivers for detection. The system has already
   shown the capability to provide temperature and/or conductivity
   variations in phantoms and biological tissue. In this article, a variant
   of the initially constructed modality is theoretically and
   experimentally investigated. Specifically, dielectric matching materials
   are used in an effort to improve the system's focusing attributes. The
   theoretical study investigates the effect of dielectric matching
   materials on the system's detection depth, whereas measurements with
   phantoms focus on the investigation of the system's detection level and
   spatial resolution. The combined results suggest that the dielectric
   matching layers lead to the improvement of the system's detection depth
   and temperature detection level. Also, the system's spatial resolution
   is explored at various experimental setups. Theoretical and experimental
   results conclude that with the appropriate combination of operation
   frequencies and dielectric layers, it is possible to monitor areas of

AB Malaria transmission is strongly influenced by environmental
   temperature, but the biological drivers remain poorly quantified. Most
   studies analyzing malaria-temperature relations, including those
   investigating malaria risk and the possible impacts of climate change,
   are based solely on mean temperatures and extrapolate from functions
   determined under unrealistic laboratory conditions. Here, we present
   empirical evidence to show that, in addition to mean temperatures, daily
   fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of
   parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology
   that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we
   find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant mean temperatures,
   temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures acts to speed up
   rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high mean temperatures acts
   to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of
   the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or
   contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at
   lower mean temperatures than currently predicted and can potentially
   block transmission at higher mean temperatures. If we are to optimize
   control efforts and develop appropriate adaptation or mitigation
   strategies for future climates, we need to incorporate into predictive
   models the effects of daily temperature variation and how that variation
   is altered by climate change.

   (i) whether these intermediates are important; (ii) how the ribosomal
   translocase, the GTPase elongation factor G (EF-G), promotes directed
   movement; and (iii) how the energy of GTP hydrolysis is coupled to
   movement. In the light of recent advances in biophysical and structural
   studies, we argue that intermediate states of translocation are
   snapshots of dynamic fluctuations that guide the movement. In contrast
   to current models of stepwise translocation, kinetic evidence shows that
   the tRNAs move synchronously on the two ribosomal subunits in a rapid
   reaction orchestrated by EF-G and GTP hydrolysis. EF-G combines the
   energy regimes of a GTPase and a motor protein and facilitates tRNA
   movement by a combination of directed Brownian ratchet and power stroke
   mechanisms.

AB The growth of aerobic bacteria on Korean seasoned soybean sprouts was
   modelled as a function of temperature to estimate microbial spoilage and
   shelf life on a real-time basis under dynamic storage conditions. Counts
   of aerobic bacteria on seasoned soybean sprouts stored at constant
   temperatures between 0 degrees C and 15 degrees C were recorded. The
   bootstrapping method was applied to generate many resampled data sets of
   mean microbial plate counts that were then used to estimate the
   parameters of the microbial growth model of Baranyi and Roberts. The
   distributions of the model parameters were quantified, and their
   temperature dependencies were expressed as mathematical functions. When
   the temperature functions of the parameters were incorporated into
   differential equations describing microbial growth, predictions of
   microbial growth under fluctuating temperature conditions were similar
   to observed microbial growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Plant ecologists have long been concerned with a seemingly paradoxical
   scenario in the relationship between plant growth and climate change:
   warming may actually increase the risk of plant frost damage. The
   underlying hypothesis is that mild winters and warm, early springs,
   which are expected to occur as the climate warms, may induce premature
   plant development, resulting in exposure of vulnerable plant tissues and
   organs to subsequent late-season frosts. The 2007 spring freeze in the
   eastern United States provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate this
   hypothesis and assess its large-scale consequences. In this article, we
   contrast the rapid prefreeze phenological advancement caused by
   unusually warm conditions with the dramatic postfreeze setback, and
   report complicated patterns of freeze damage to plants. The widespread
   devastation of crops and natural vegetation occasioned by this event
   demonstrates the need to consider large fluctuations in spring
   temperatures a real threat to terrestrial ecosystem structure and
   functioning in a warming climate.

AB Each plant species has particular requirements for seed germination, and
   some of them respond differently to constant or alternating temperature
   regimes. In this study, the interchangeable effects of different
   treatments and temperatures on the completion of seed germination of
   Clematis vitalba L. were investigated. The seeds were tested with a
   constant (from 5 degrees C to 25 degrees C) or a fluctuating (25/10
   degrees C) temperature regime, and the effect of gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)), incubation at warm (W) or cold (C) temperatures while being
   imbibed, and drying after ripening (DAR) were evaluated. The final
   germination percentages and the time in days required to reach 50% of
   germination (T-50) were calculated. GA(3) and C significantly enhanced
   completion of seed germination at all of the temperatures tested. A
   strong positive effect of alternating temperature was observed, which
   triggered completion of seed germination regardless of treatment. Under
   the fluctuating temperature, the chilled seeds had the most rapid
   germination. Low germination rates were observed for both control and
   DAR treatments. Seeds of C. vitalba display a certain degree of
   dormancy, which can be broken by moist chilling and GA(3) treatments.
   Moreover, alternating temperature stimulates the completion of seed
   germination by satisfying certain physiological requirements for
   germination under constant temperatures.

AB Complex environments, characterized by co-varying factors (e.g.
   temperature and food availability) may cause animals to invest resources
   differentially into fitness-related traits. Thus, experiments
   manipulating multiple environmental factors concurrently provide
   valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only
   important traits (e.g. dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also
   trait-trait interactions (e.g. trade-offs between traits). We used a
   multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant
   28 degrees C vs. 28 +/- 5 degrees C daily cycle) and food availability
   (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand
   field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found
   that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted
   survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment.
   Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy,
   we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced
   investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a
   sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that
   was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and
   food availability. We develop an experimental and statistical framework
   to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different
   life-history traits. This approach can be applied to a range of
   biological systems to investigate how environmental complexity
   influences traits and trait trade-offs.

AB Temperature has a major influence on the rate of embryonic development
   in ectothermic organisms. While incubation experiments unambiguously
   show that constant high temperature accelerates development and shortens
   embryonic life, studies on the effect of fluctuating temperatures have
   generated contradictory results. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) occur at
   latitudes and altitudes that are unusually cool for an oviparous
   reptile. In these cool climates females typically lay their eggs in
   heat-generating anthropogenic microhabitats that provide either a highly
   fluctuating (compost piles) or a relatively constant (manure heaps)
   thermal nesting environment. A laboratory experiment with fluctuating
   and constant incubation temperatures mimicking those recorded in such
   nests in the field showed that this nest-site dichotomy influences the
   development of the embryos, and the morphology and locomotor performance
   of the hatchlings. The incubation period increased at fluctuating
   temperatures and the fact that the rate of embryonic development showed
   a decelerating pattern with temperature suggests that periods of low
   temperature had a relatively larger influence on average development
   than periods of high temperature. Our study demonstrates how a dichotomy
   in the nesting environments available to female grass snakes in cool
   climates can affect variation in the duration of the incubation period
   and offspring phenotypes in ways that may have consequences for fitness.

AB Facultative hatching in response to environmental cues may increase the
   viability of offspring, if the cue that stimulates hatching also
   predicts the negative consequences of delayed emergence. Declining
   incubation temperatures might provide such a cue for montane lizards,
   because eggs that fail to hatch before winter will perish in the nest. I
   tested this idea by incubating eggs of an alpine scincid lizard
   (Bassiana duperreyi) in the laboratory. For the first half of the
   incubation period the eggs were kept at nest temperatures typical of
   those experienced in summer in the field (daily cycle of
   18+/-7.5degreesC). I then transferred eggs at weekly intervals into
   cooler regimes (either 15+/-7.5degreesC; or with daytime temperatures
   unchanged but dropping to 0degreesC overnight). Contrary to prediction,
   the eggs did not hatch early. However, transfer to lower temperatures
   caused only a relatively short delay in hatching, because of a virtual
   temperature-independence of developmental rates late (but not early) in
   incubation. Decreasing incubation temperatures also modified hatchling
   running speeds and post-hatching growth rates, even if the thermal
   decrease occurred only shortly before the usual time of hatching. These
   processes plausibly affect hatchling fitness in cold-climate reptiles,
   and might be adaptations to montane habitats. Alternatively, they may
   prove to be widespread in other (warmer-climate) reptile taxa, in which
   case no adaptive hypothesis need be proposed. (C) 2002 The Linnean

AB Drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest causing severe damages to a large
   panel of cultivated crops. To facilitate its biocontrol with strategies
   such as sterile or incompatible insect techniques, D. suzukii must be
   mass-produced and then stored and transported under low temperature.
   Prolonged cold exposure induces chill injuries that can be mitigated if
   the cold period is interrupted with short warming intervals, referred to
   as fluctuating thermal regimes (FTR). In this study, we tested how to
   optimally use FTR to extend the shelf life of D. suzukii under cold
   storage. Several FTR parameters were assessed: temperature (15, 20, 25
   degrees C), duration (0.5, 1, 2, 3 h), and frequency (every 12, 24, 36,
   48 h) of warming intervals, in two wild-type lines and in two
   developmental stages (pupae and adults). Generally, FTR improved cold
   storage tolerance with respect to constant low temperatures (CLT). Cold
   mortality was lower when recovery temperature was 20 degrees C or
   higher, when duration was 2 h per day or longer, and when warming
   interruptions occurred frequently (every 12 or 24 h). Applying an
   optimized FTR protocol to adults greatly reduced cold mortality over
   long-term storage (up to 130 d). Consequences of FTR on fitness-related
   traits were also investigated. For adults, poststorage survival was
   unaffected by FTR, as was the case for female fecundity and male mating
   capacity. On the other hand, when cold storage occurred at pupal stage,
   poststorage survival and male mating capacity were altered under CLT,
   but not under FTR. After storage of pupae, female fecundity was lower
   under FTR compared to CLT, suggesting an energy trade-off between repair
   of chill damages and egg production. This study provides detailed
   information on the application and optimization of an FTR-based protocol
   for cold storage of D. suzukii that could be useful for the biocontrol
   of this pest.

AB 1. Lately, there has been interest in using the intrinsic growth rate
   (rm) to predict the effects of climate warming on ectotherm population
   viability. However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka
   equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends
   on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage
   distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate
   this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic
   descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a
   stage-structured population model that realistically captures the
   temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that
   characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations
   experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage
   distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years.
   As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains
   constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows
   populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature
   effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal
   regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development
   and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g.
   changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g.
   reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes).
   As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable
   response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to
   temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution
   and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase
   in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal
   fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita
   growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow
   relative to the developmental period of the organism (003-005 degrees C
   per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well
   before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 01 degrees C per year). The
   Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is
   slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the
   deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing
   developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of
   ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species
   with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short
   time-scales and under slow warming regimes.

AB Anuran embryos and tadpoles are daily exposed to wide thermal variations
   in their ponds, with maximum temperatures at midday. The aim of this
   research was to study the impact of three daily variable thermal
   environments (with maximum experimental temperatures between 10:00 and
   16:00 hours), on the survival, developmental time and body size of
   metamorphs of four tropical anuran species from lowland habitats in
   Colombia. A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis
   (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and
   Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily
   variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5(circle)C;
   maximum temperature = 34 +/- 1(circle)C; range = 23-35(circle)C), medium
   temperature (25.5(circle)C; 29 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-30(circle)C), and low
   temperature (24(circle)C; 24 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-25(circle)C). For the
   other species, Espadarana prosoblepon, 40 embryos to metamorphosis were
   exposed to each one of the following thermal treatments: high
   temperature (mean = 22(circle)C; maximum temperature = 25 +/- 1
   C-circle; range = 18-26(circle)C), medium temperature (20.5(circle) C;
   22 +/- 1 C-circle; 18-23 C-circle), and low temperature (19 C-circle; 19
   +/- 1(circle) C; 18-20 C-circle). For all species, the thermal variable
   environment with the highest temperature showed the greatest accumulated
   survival, reduced significantly the developmental time from embryos to
   metamorphs, and the snout-vent-length of metamorphs. Therefore, under
   field conditions where ponds are exposed to thermally variable
   environments, the highest temperatures may promote a decrease in the
   period of time to metamorphosis, and a positive increase for the anuran
   survival; nevertheless, extreme temperatures were also found in the
   microhabitat of the species studied, higher than their upper thermal
   limits reported, which suggest a vulnerable situation for them and other
   tropical anurans from similar habitats.

AB With climate change, global average sea surface temperatures are
   expected to increase by 1.0-3.7 degrees C by the end of this century.
   Even a 1.0 degrees C increase in seawater temperature from local
   long-term summer maxima lasting for weeks to months results in bleaching
   and/or mortality in reef-building corals. Studies on coral resistance
   mechanisms have proposed a correlation between shuffling of different
   Symbiodiniaceae genera (changing the dominant Symbiodiniaceae genera)
   and putative thermal tolerance in corals. Although it was suggested that
   some corals can increase their tolerance by 1.0-1.5 degrees C through
   shuffling to thermally tolerant Durusdinium trenchii (formerly D1a), the
   effects of accumulated thermal stress due to prolonged high temperatures
   on the survival of corals that have shuffled have not been investigated.
   We show herein that prolonged exposure to high temperature (>
   10.43-degree heating weeks) can drastically reduce coral survival rate
   even after it has shuffled to stress-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae genera.
   Our study suggests that there is a limit to the capacity of for
   shuffling, and hence is likely to lose its efficacy in the future as
   repeated and prolonged thermal stress events become more frequent and
   pronounced.

   climate regimes found at higher latitudes. Using experimental lineages
   of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial
   phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable
   conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity
   contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel
   climates. Results We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve
   during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more
   variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however,
   associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions,
   resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the
   ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast,
   lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures
   over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold
   tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions We propose that thermal
   adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates
   found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic
   compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages
   of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal
   adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile
   evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic
   assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on
   existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal
   tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these
   traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.

AB Marine calanoid copepods colonize new habitats, and some become
   invasive. Their fitness, measured by intrinsic growth rate and net
   reproductive rate, is partially driven by biochemical processes. Thus,
   it is a function of ambient temperature. Biochemical processes may not
   be approximated well by yearly mean temperature alone when temperature
   cycles yearly, largely. Higher order moments may also be important. The
   amplitude of yearly fluctuations of monthly and seasonal sea
   temperatures varies dramatically across the northern temperate regions.
   Thus, they can impact the fitness, thereby the colonization potential of
   copepods migrating across such region. To investigate this, we derive
   approximate metrics of periodic (yearly) fitness: the yearly intrinsic
   growth rate, and a weighted net reproductive rate. We use them to
   measure the persistence and the growth of an Allee-effect free,
   stage-structured, fast-maturing, small population of invasive copepods
   that reproduces year-round in habitats with yearly temperature cycles.
   We show that the yearly fitness increases substantially when a
   population is introduced from a habitat with large amplitude to that
   with small amplitude yearly fluctuating temperatures, given that their
   mean temperatures and other environmental and ecological factors are
   constant. The detected range-expansion of the modeled species matches
   the potential fitness gradient predicted by the metrics. The study leads
   to the question whether the gradient of the amplitudes of temperature
   between habitats with similar yearly mean temperatures impacts a class
   of fast-maturating calanoid copepods, colonizing new habitats, and
   becoming invasive.

AB Human-induced thermal variability can disrupt energy balance and
   performance in ectotherms; however, phenotypic plasticity may play a
   pivotal protective role. Ectotherm performance can be maintained in
   thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of
   physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the
   capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond
   to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed
   to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable:
   13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1))
   thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5
   degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass
   gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the
   thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed,
   U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth
   was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures
   compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant
   variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments,
   suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature
   rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a
   plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive
   to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal
   breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod
   treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures
   (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52
   +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL
   s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.). In combination, these findings
   suggest juvenile A. medirostris are resilient to daily fluctuations in
   temperature, within the temperature range tested here.

AB The aggregation of proteins is believed to be intimately connected to
   many neurodegenerative disorders. We recently reported an "Ockham's
   razor"/minimalistic approach to analyze the kinetic data of protein
   aggregation using the Finke-Watzky (F-W) 2-step model of nucleation (A
   -> B, rate constant k(1)) and autocatalytic growth (A+B -> 2B, rate
   constant k(2)). With that kinetic model we have analyzed 41
   representative protein aggregation data sets in two recent publications,
   including amyloid beta, alpha-synuclein, polyglutamine, and prion
   proteins (Morris, A. M., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 2413-2427;
   Watzky, M. A., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47,10790-10800). Herein we use
   the F-W model to reanalyze protein aggregation kinetic data obtained
   under the experimental conditions of variable temperature or pH 2.0 to
   8.5. We provide the average nucleation (k(1)) and growth (k(2)) rate
   constants and correlations with variable temperature or varying pH for
   the protein alpha-synuclein. From the variable temperature data,
   activation parameters Delta G double dagger, Delta H double dagger, and
   Delta S double dagger are provided for nucleation and growth, and those
   values are compared to the available parameters reported in the previous
   literature determined using an empirical method. Our activation
   parameters suggest that nucleation and growth are energetically similar
   for alpha-synuclein aggregation (Delta G(nucleation)double dagger =
   23(3) kcal/mol; Delta G(growth)double dagger = 22(1) kcal/mol at 37
   degrees C. From the variable pH data, the F-W analyses show a maximal
   k(1) value at pH similar to 3, as well as minimal k(1) near the
   isoelectric point (pI) of alpha-synuclein. Since solubility and net
   charge are minimized at the pI, either or both of these factors may be
   important in determining the kinetics of the nucleation step. On the
   other hand, the k(2) values increase with decreasing pH (i.e., do not
   appear to have a minimum or maximum near the pI) which, when combined
   with the k(1) vs. pH (and pI) data, suggest that solubility and charge
   are less important factors for growth, and that charge is important in
   the k1, nucleation step of alpha-synuclein. The chemically well-defined
   nucleation (k(1)) rate constants obtained from the F-W analysis are, as
   expected, different than the 1/tag-time empirical constants previously
   obtained. However, k(2) x [A](o) (where k(2) is the rate constant for
   autocatalytic growth and [A](o) is the initial protein concentration) is
   related to the empirical constant, k(app) obtained previously. Overall,
   the average nucleation and average growth rate constants for
   alpha-synuclein aggregation as a function of pH and variable temperature
   have been quantitated. Those values support the previously suggested
   formation of a partially folded intermediate that promotes aggregation
   under high temperature or acidic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB High temperatures can negatively impact the performance and survival of
   organisms, particularly ectotherms. While an organism's response to high
   temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its
   response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of
   past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta
   larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations
   during development affected gene expression both independently and in
   conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene
   expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a
   genetically related field population that have been separated for >300
   generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted
   larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both
   single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could
   decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large
   differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two
   populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific
   transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed
   genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae.
   Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on
   long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat
   elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing
   conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat
   stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the
   particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased
   knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of
   organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the
   development of more accurate thermal performance models.

AB The response of coral-reef ecosystems to contemporary thermal stress may
   be in part a consequence of recent or historical sea-surface temperature
   (SST) variability. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether: (i)
   there was a relationship between the historical frequency of SST
   variability and stress experienced during the most recent thermal-stress
   events (in 1998 and 2005-2006) and (ii) coral reefs that historically
   experienced frequent thermal anomalies were less likely to experience
   coral bleaching during these recent thermal-stress events. Examination
   of nine detrended coral delta O-18 and Sr/Ca anomaly records revealed a
   high-(5.7-year) and low-frequency (>54-year) mode of SST variability.
   There was a positive relationship between the historical frequency of
   SST anomalies and recent thermal stress; sites historically dominated by
   the high-frequency mode experienced greater thermal stress than other
   sites during both events, and showed extensive coral bleaching in 1998.
   Nonetheless, in 2005-2006, corals at sites dominated by high-frequency
   variability showed reduced bleaching, despite experiencing high thermal
   stress. This bleaching resistance was most likely a consequence of rapid
   directional selection that followed the extreme thermal event of 1998.
   However, the benefits of regional resistance could come at the
   considerable cost of shifts in coral species composition.

AB Plants flower in particular seasons even in natural, fluctuating
   environments. The molecular basis of temperature-dependent
   flowering-time regulation has been extensively studied, but little is
   known about how gene expression is controlled in natural environments.
   Without a memory of past temperatures, it would be difficult for plants
   to detect seasons in natural, noisy environments because temperature
   changes occurring within a few weeks are often inconsistent with
   seasonal trends. Our 2-y census of the expression of a
   temperature-dependent flowering-time gene, AhgFLC, in a natural
   population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri revealed that the regulatory
   system of this flowering-time gene extracts seasonal cues as if it
   memorizes temperatures over the past 6 wk. Time-series analysis revealed
   that as much as 83% of the variation in the AhgFLC expression is
   explained solely by the temperature for the previous 6 wk, but not by
   the temperatures over shorter or longer periods. The accuracy of our
   model in predicting the gene expression pattern under contrasting
   temperature regimes in the transplant experiments indicates that such
   modeling incorporating the molecular bases of flowering-time regulation
   will contribute to predicting plant responses to future climate changes.

AB The relationship between ectotherm ecology and climatic conditions has
   been mainly evaluated in terms of average conditions. Average
   temperature is the more common climatic variable used in physiological
   and population studies, and its effect on individual and
   population-level processes is well understood. However, the intrinsic
   variability of thermal conditions calls attention to the potential
   effects that this variability could have in ecological systems.
   Regarding this point, two hypotheses are proposed. From the allocation
   principle, it may be inferred that if temperature variability is high
   enough to induce stress in the organisms, then this extra-cost should
   reduce the energetic budget for reproduction, which will be reflected in
   population parameters. Moreover, a mathematical property of non-linear
   functions, Jensen's inequality, indicates that, in concave functions,
   like the temperature-reproduction performance function, variability
   reduces the expected value of the output variable, and again modifies
   population parameters. To test these hypotheses, experimental cultures
   of Tribolium confusum under two different thermal variability regimens
   were carried out. With these data, we fitted a simple population
   dynamics model to evaluate the predictions of our hypothesis. The
   results show that thermal variability reduces the maximum reproductive
   rate of the population but no other parameters such as carrying capacity
   or the nonlinear factor in a nonlinear version of the Ricker model,
   which confirms our hypotheses. This result has important consequences,
   such as the paradoxical increase in population variability under a
   decrease in thermal variability and the necessary incorporation of
   climatic variability to evaluate the net effect of climate change on the
   dynamics of natural populations.

AB The thermal environment during development influences many aspects of
   the phenotype of hatchling reptiles. We hypothesized that temperature
   should differentially affect early incubation stages, in which
   differentiation dominates over growth, and late incubation stages,
   characterized by high growth rates. To test this idea, we incubated eggs
   of wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) under three regimes with the same mean
   temperature (29 degrees C), one constant and two variable with opposite
   sequences: first cold (25 degrees C) and then hot (32 degrees C), and
   vice versa. Hatchlings incubated at high temperature during the initial
   period had shorter hindlimbs and tails than those incubated under the
   other two temperature regimes and shorter heads than those incubated
   initially at low temperature. Thus, temperature experienced by embryos
   during the early external incubation period produced similar phenotypic
   responses compared to those reported in previous studies for the same
   constant temperature applied over the whole incubation period. Because
   female wall lizards select lower body temperatures during pregnancy, an
   increase of intrauterine retention would extend the time of exposure of
   developing embryos to suitable temperatures. Diminution of body
   temperature during pregnancy is contrary to the expected pattern under
   the hypothesis that egg retention has evolved to accelerate development,
   as proposed by the cold-climate model for evolution of viviparity in
   squamates, and the results of the present study support the alternative
   hypothesis of developmental optimization as a special case of the
   broader maternal manipulation view.

AB The scarcity of information on the micrometeorology and water use of
   rain-fed humid tropical crops leads to uncertainty about the effects of
   land cover change on streamflow and atmospheric circulation. We made
   micrometeorological measurements during five wet season months in a
   rain-fed cropping system with maize (Zea mays L.) and cassava (Manihot
   esculenta Crantz) on a bench-terraced hillside in upland West Java,
   Indonesia. Reflection coefficients varied between 0.07 for moist bare
   soil and 0.22 for mature cassava with surface mulching. Fluxes of heat
   and vapour were estimated by the temperature variance method from wet-
   and dry-bulb temperature fluctuations measured with fast-responding
   thermocouples. Sensible heat fluxes were 24% larger when determined from
   Bowen ratios rather than directly, but latent heat fluxes inferred from
   the two estimates agreed within 10%. The difference was largely
   attributed to the greater effect of high-frequency losses on directly
   calculated fluxes. The Penman-Monteith model with optimised values for
   surface conductance (12.7 turn s(-1)), roughness length (0.03 times crop
   height) and displacement length (0.64 times crop height) was used to
   estimate dry canopy evaporation (E-t) for a full year, allowing for the
   effect of reduced soil water availability during the dry season.
   Rainfall interception losses (E-i) were estimated with an adapted
   version of the Gash model calibrated with local measurements of
   throughfall and stemflow. Simulations with a soil-vegetation-atmosphere
   transfer model reported elsewhere demonstrated that modelled evaporation
   rates were consistent with soil hydrological measurements. Total water
   use was 1228 mm, divided between 1030 mm crop transpiration and soil
   evaporation and 198 mm rainfall interception losses. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB Changes in cell size might be an important component of adaptation to
   thermal heterogeneity. Although Drosophila melanogaster develops smaller
   cells at fluctuating temperatures, we do not know whether this response
   depends on the frequency or amplitude of thermal change. In a laboratory
   experiment, we exposed flies to either frequent or infrequent
   fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C, while controlling the total
   exposure to each temperature. Flies emerged from these treatments with
   similar body sizes, but flies at more frequent fluctuations emerged
   earlier and had smaller epidermal cells for a given body size. Tissue
   built from small cells has more nuclei for transcription, shorter
   distances between cell compartments, and a larger surface area for
   transport across membranes. Therefore, we hypothesize that physiological
   effects of small cells reduce lags in metabolic activity and enhance
   performance of flies during warming. For plasticity of cell size to
   confer a fitness advantage, this hypothetical benefit must outweigh the
   cost of maintaining a greater area of plasma membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB While insect cold tolerance has been well studied, the vast majority of
   work has focused on the effects of a single cold exposure. However, many
   abiotic environmental stresses, including temperature, fluctuate within
   an organism's lifespan. Given that organisms may trade-off survival at
   the cost of future reproduction, we investigated the effects of multiple
   cold exposures on survival and fertility in the model organism
   Drosophila melanogaster. We found that multiple cold exposures
   significantly decreased mortality compared with the same length of
   exposure in a single sustained bout, but significantly decreased
   fecundity (as measured by r, the intrinsic rate of increase) as well,
   owing to a shift in sex ratio. This change was reflected in a long-term
   decrease in glycogen stores in multiply exposed flies, while a brief
   effect on triglyceride stores was observed, suggesting flies are
   reallocating energy stores. Given that many environments are not static,
   this trade-off indicates that investigating the effects of repeated
   stress exposure is important for understanding and predicting
   physiological responses in the wild.

AB Organisms often experience adverse high temperatures during the daytime,
   but they may also recover or repair themselves during the night-time
   when temperatures are more moderate. Thermal effects of daily
   fluctuating temperatures may thus be divided into two opposite processes
   (i.e. negative effects of daytime heat stress and positive effects of
   night-time recovery). Despite recent progress on the consequences of
   increased daily temperature variability, the independent and combined
   effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on organism performance
   remain unclear. By independently manipulating daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures, we tested how changes in daytime heat stress and
   night-time recovery affect development, survival and heat tolerance of
   the lady beetle species Propylea japonica. Thermal effects on
   development and survival differed between daytime and night-time.
   Daytime high temperatures had negative effects whereas night-time mild
   temperatures had positive effects. The extent of daytime heat stress and
   night-time recovery also affected development and critical thermal
   maximum, which indicates that there were both independent and combined
   effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on thermal performances.
   Our findings provide insight into the thermal effect of day-to-night
   temperature variability and have important implications for predicting
   the impacts of diel asymmetric warming under climate change.

AB Costs of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments have often been
   studied in morphological structures. Such structures typically are
   irreversible for at least some stage in the organism's life. In this
   study we investigated whether recurrent and reversible adaptation to
   changes in the thermal environment incurs a cost in terms of some key
   life-history traits in the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We exposed
   juvenile O. cincta to two treatments differing in the frequency of
   temperature fluctuation but with equal total temperature sums. In the
   high frequency treatment temperature fluctuated daily between 10 and 20
   degrees C, while in the low frequency treatment temperature fluctuated
   on a weekly schedule. During the treatments we measured juvenile growth
   rate and juvenile mortality, and after six weeks the animals were
   transferred to constant 15 degrees C and adult starvation resistance was
   assessed. We found no significant differences between the treatments in
   juvenile growth rate or juvenile survival. Also, adults that had grown
   up under high frequency temperature fluctuations did not suffer from
   reduced starvation resistance compared to animals growing under low
   frequency temperature fluctuations. This finding supports the hypothesis
   that selection minimizes the production costs of inducible phenotypes
   and suggests that the development of optimal phenotypes and evolution of
   temperature reaction norms are not constrained by such costs. (C) 2011

AB Local adaptation to heterogeneous environments generates population
   diversity within species, significantly increasing ecosystem stability
   and flows of ecosystem services. However, few studies have isolated the
   specific mechanisms that create and maintain this diversity. Here, we
   examined the relationship between water temperature in streams used for
   spawning and genetic diversity at a gene involved in immune function
   [the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)] in 14 populations of
   sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) sampled across the Wood River basin
   in south-western Alaska. The largest influence on MHC diversity was lake
   basin, but we also found a significant positive correlation between
   average water temperature and MHC diversity. This positive relationship
   between temperature and MHC diversity appears to have been produced by
   natural selection at very local scales rather than neutral processes, as
   no correlation was observed between temperature and genetic diversity at
   90 neutral markers. Additionally, no significant relationship was
   observed between temperature variability and MHC diversity. Although
   lake basin was the largest driver of differences in MHC diversity, our
   results also demonstrate that fine-scale differences in water
   temperature may generate variable selection regimes in populations that
   spawn in habitats separated by as little as 1km. Additionally, our
   results indicated that some populations may be reaching a maximum level
   of MHC diversity. We postulate that salmon from populations in warm
   streams may delay spawning until late summer to avoid thermal stress as
   well as the elevated levels of pathogen prevalence and virulence
   associated with warm temperatures earlier in the summer.

AB Temperature is a key environmental driver of Anopheles mosquito
   population dynamics; understanding its central role is important for
   these malaria vectors. Mosquito population responses to temperature
   fluctuations, though important across the life history, are poorly
   understood at a population level. We used stage-structured,
   temperature-dependent delay-differential equations to conduct a detailed
   exploration of the impacts of diurnal and annual temperature
   fluctuations on mosquito population dynamics. The model allows
   exploration of temperature-driven temporal changes in adult age
   structure, giving insights into the population's capacity to vector
   malaria parasites. Because of temperature-dependent shifts in age
   structure, the abundance of potentially infectious mosquitoes varies
   temporally, and does not necessarily mirror the dynamics of the total
   adult population. In addition to conducting the first comprehensive
   theoretical exploration of fluctuating temperatures on mosquito
   population dynamics, we analysed observed temperatures at four locations
   in Africa covering a range of environmental conditions. We found both
   temperature and precipitation are needed to explain the observed malaria
   season in these locations, enhancing our understanding of the drivers of
   malaria seasonality and how temporal disease risk may shift in response
   to temperature changes. This approach, tracking both mosquito abundance
   and age structure, may be a powerful tool for understanding current and
   future malaria risk.

AB Background: Childhood pneumonia is one of the leading single causes of
   mortality and morbidity in children worldwide, but its etiology still
   remains unclear.
   Objective: We investigate the association between childhood pneumonia
   and exposure to diurnal temperature variation (DTV) in different timing
   windows.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 2,598 children aged
   3-6 years in Changsha, China. The lifetime prevalence of pneumonia was
   assessed by a questionnaire administered by the parents. Individual
   exposure to DTV during both prenatal and postnatal periods was
   estimated. Logic regression models was used to examine the association
   between childhood pneumonia and DTV exposure in terms of odds ratios
   (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of childhood pneumonia in preschool
   children in Changsha was high up to 38.6%. We found that childhood
   pneumonia was significantly associated with prenatal DTV exposure, with
   adjusted OR (95%CI) =1.19 (1.02-1.38), particularly during the second
   trimester. However, childhood pneumonia not associated with postnatal
   DTV exposure. Sensitivity analysis indicated that boys are more
   susceptible to the pneumonia risk of diurnal temperature variation than
   girls. We further observed that the prevalence of childhood pneumonia
   was decreased in recent years as DTV shrinked.
   Conclusions: Early childhood pneumonia was associated with prenatal
   exposure to the diurnal temperature variation (DTV) during pregnancy,
   particularly in the second trimester, which suggests fetal origin of
   childhood pneumonia.

AB Coral communities display spatial patterns. These patterns can manifest
   along a coastline as well as across the continental shelf due to
   ecological interactions and environmental gradients. Several abiotic
   surrogates for environmental variables are hypothesised to structure
   high-latitude coral communities in South Africa along and across its
   narrow shelf and were investigated using a correlative approach that
   considered spatial autocorrelation. Surveys of sessile communities were
   conducted on 17 reefs and related to depth, distance to high tide,
   distance to the continental shelf edge and to submarine canyons. All
   four environmental variables were found to correlate significantly with
   community composition, even after the effects of space were removed. The
   environmental variables accounted for 13% of the variation in
   communities; 77% of this variation was spatially structured. Spatially
   structured environmental variation unrelated to the environmental
   variables accounted for 39% of the community variation. The Northern
   Reef Complex appears to be less affected by oceanic factors and may
   undergo less temperature variability than the Central and Southern
   Complexes; the first is mentioned because it had the lowest canyon
   effect and was furthest from the continental shelf, whilst the latter
   complexes had the highest canyon effects and were closest to the shelf
   edge. These characteristics may be responsible for the spatial
   differences in the coral communities.

   tactics, the consequences of 11 constant (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,
   32, 34, 35 and 36 degrees C) and nine variable temperatures (with equal
   mean temperatures at each of the nine constant rates ranging from 15to35
   degrees C) on survival and embryonic development were studied. The eggs
   were able to complete development at constant temperatures between 15
   and 35 degrees C, with mortality rates at the extremes of the range of
   two and 81.5%, respectively. Using variable temperatures a mortality
   rate of 38.9% at a mean temperature of 15 degrees C and 99% at 35
   degrees C was observed. The range of time for embryonic development was
   29.5 d at 15 degrees C to 6 d at 32 degrees C at constant temperatures,
   and from 29.6 d at 15 degrees C to 7.2 d at 32 degrees C at variable
   temperatures. The goodness-of-fit of different development models was
   evaluated for the relationship between the development rate and
   temperature. The models that gave the best fit were the Logan type III
   for constant temperatures and the Briere for variable temperatures.
   Optimum temperatures were estimated to be from 31.7 to 32.9 degrees C.
   The models that best described embryo development under natural field
   conditions were the Logan type III model for constant temperatures
   (98.7% adjustment) and the Lactin model for variable temperatures (99.2%
   adjustment). Nonlinear models predicted faster development at constant
   temperatures and slower development at variable ones when compared with
   real field development, whereas the linear model always predicted faster
   development than what actually took place.

AB The antioxidant defense protects turtles from oxidative stress caused by
   adverse environment conditions, such as acute thermal fluctuations.
   However, it remains unclear how these defenses work. The present study
   examined changes in key enzymes of the enzymatic antioxidant system and
   the glutathione (GSH) system at both the mRNA and enzyme activity levels
   during acute cold exposure and recovery in juvenile Chinese soft shelled
   turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis. Transcript levels of the upstream
   regulator NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were also measured. Turtles were
   acdimated at 28 degrees C (3 weeks), then given acute cold exposure (8
   degrees C, 12 h) and finally placed in recovery (28 degrees C, 24 h).
   The mRNA levels of cerebral and hepatic Nrf2 and of genes encoding
   downstream antioxidant enzymes did not change, whereas levels of nephric
   Nrf2, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase
   4 (GPx4) mRNA decreased upon cold exposure. During recovery, Nrf2 mRNA
   remained stable in all three tissues, hepatic Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD and
   catalase (CAT) mRNA levels increased, and nephric MnSOD and GPx4 mRNAs
   did not change from the values during cold exposure. In the GSH system,
   mRNA levels of most enzymes remained constant during cold exposure and
   recovery. Unmatched with changes in mRNA level, high and stable
   constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities were maintained throughout,
   whereas GPx activity significantly reduced in the kidney during cold
   exposure, and in liver and kidney during recovery. Our results suggest
   that the antioxidant defense regulation in response to acute cold
   exposure in P. sinensis may not be achieved at the transcriptional
   level, but may rely mainly on high constitutive antioxidant enzyme
   activities.

AB Fluctuating environments are expected to select for individuals that
   have highest geometric fitness over the experienced environments. This
   leads to the prediction that genetically determined environmental
   robustness in fitness, and average fitness across environments should be
   positively genetically correlated to fitness in fluctuating
   environments. Because quantitative genetic experiments resolving these
   predictions are missing, we used a full-sib, half-sib breeding design to
   estimate genetic variance for egg-to-adult viability in Drosophila
   melanogaster exposed to two constant or fluctuating temperatures that
   were above the species' optimum temperature, during development.
   Viability in two constant environments (25 degrees C or 30 degrees C)
   was used to estimate breeding values for environmental robustness of
   viability (i.e., reaction norm slope) and overall viability (reaction
   norm elevation). These breeding values were regressed against breeding
   values of viability at two different fluctuating temperatures (with a
   mean of 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C). Our results based on genetic
   correlations show that average egg-to-adult viability across different
   constant thermal environments, and not the environmental robustness, was
   the most important factor for explaining the fitness in fluctuating
   thermal environments. Our results suggest that the role of environmental
   robustness in adapting to fluctuating environments might be smaller than
   anticipated.

AB Koinobiont parasitoid insects, which maintain intimate and long-term
   relationships with their arthropod hosts, constitute an association of
   ectothermic organisms that is particularly sensitive to temperature
   variations. Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily
   fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature
   range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid
   interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several
   developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina
   boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of
   16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16
   degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C
   constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C,
   which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we
   showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a
   fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A
   fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of
   the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the
   ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we
   demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into
   diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant
   temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant
   temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the
   need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes
   that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is
   particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which
   constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on
   interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental temperature is an abiotic factor with great influence on
   biological processes of living beings. Jensen's inequality states that
   for non-lineal processes, such as most biological phenomena, the effects
   of thermal fluctuations cannot be predicted from mean constant
   temperatures. We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation
   (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and
   an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from
   egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect
   measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single
   blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C),
   or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into
   account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical
   distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment
   will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time
   and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in
   females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher
   body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime,
   suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments.
   At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would
   imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and,
   consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects. On
   the contrary, lower fecundity could be associated with a decrease in
   population growth. This knowledge will not only provide basic
   information to the field of insect ecophysiology, but also could be a
   useful background to develop population and disease transmission models.

AB Increasing the thermal stability of immobilized proteins is a motivating
   goal for improving the performance of electrochemical biodevices. In
   this work, we propose the immobilization of crosslinked plastocyanin
   from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum by
   simultaneous incubation of a mixture of plastocyanin and the coupling
   reagents. The thermal stability of the so built covalently immobilized
   protein films has been assessed by cyclic voltammetry in the 0-90
   degrees C temperature range and has been compared to that of physisorbed
   films. It is shown that the protein loss along a thermal cycle is
   significantly reduced in the case of the crosslinked films, whose redox
   properties remain unaltered along a cyclic heating-cooling thermal scan,
   and can withstand the contact with 70 degrees C solutions for four
   hours. Comparison of thermal unfolding curves obtained by circular
   dichroism spectroscopy of both free and crosslinked protein confirms the
   improved thermic resistance of the crosslinked plastocyanin. Notably,
   the electron transfer thermodynamics of physisorbed and crosslinked
   plastocyanin films are quite similar, suggesting that the formation of
   intra- and inter-protein amide bonds do not affect the integrity and
   functionality of the copper redox centers. UV-Vis absorption and
   circular dichroism measurements corroborate that protein crosslinking
   does not alter the coordination geometry of the metal center. (C) 2018

AB Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is a worldwide
   emerging pest of soft fruits, but its cold tolerance has not been
   thoroughly explored. We determined the cold tolerance strategy, low
   temperature thermal limits, and plasticity of cold tolerance in both
   male and female adult D. suzukii. We reared flies under common
   conditions (long days, 21 degrees C; control) and induced plasticity by
   rapid cold-hardening (RCH, 1 h at 0 degrees C followed by 1 h recovery),
   cold acclimation (CA, 5 days at 6 degrees C) or acclimation under
   fluctuating temperatures (FA). D. suzukii had supercooling points (SCPs)
   between -16 and -23 degrees C, and were chill-susceptible. 80% of
   control flies were killed after 1 h at -7.2 degrees C (males) or -7.5
   degrees C (females); CA and FA improved survival of this temperature in
   both sexes, but RCH did not. 80% of control flies were killed after 70 h
   (male) or 92 h (female) at 0 degrees C, and FA shifted this to 112 h
   (males) and 165 h (females). FA flies entered chill coma (CTmin) at
   approximately -1.7 degrees C, which was ca. 0.5 degrees C colder than
   control flies; RCH and CA increased the CTmin compared to controls.
   Control and RCH flies exposed to 0 degrees C for 8 h took 30-40 min to
   recover movement, but this was reduced to <10 min in CA and FA. Flies
   placed outside in a field cage in London, Ontario, were all killed by a
   transient cold snap in December. We conclude that adult phenotypic
   plasticity is not sufficient to allow D. suzukii to overwinter in
   temperate habitats, and suggest that flies could overwinter in
   association with built structures, or that there may be additional cold
   tolerance imparted by developmental plasticity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of microhabitat temperature variation on the early
   development of Plasmodium falciparum in experimentally infected
   Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) was studied. Batches of
   mosquitoes were fed artificially on gameto-cyteamic blood obtained from
   human volunteers and then held in five environmental conditions
   described as: (1) incubator maintained at constant temperature of 28 +/-
   1 degreesC as control; (2) temperature unregulated laboratory
   environment; (3) screen house; (4) grass thatched mud house and (5)
   corrugated iron roofed mud house. Both the grass and iron roofed mud
   houses were real houses found in the village communities around the
   ICIPE Research Centre in Mbita Point, Suba District south-western Kenya.
   The temperature and relative humidity of these holding environments were
   recorded over the study period. Mosquitoes were dissected after 24 h and
   7 days to enumerate ookinetes and oocysts stages, respectively in their
   midguts.
   The mean temperature observed in the temperature-unregulated laboratory
   (28 degreesC) was significantly higher than the temperature of the
   screen house (24 degreesC) while the mean temperature observed in the
   iron roof mud house (27 degreesC) was comparable with that in the
   grass-thatched mud house (27 degreesC) although the iron roof house
   experienced more variation (coefficient of variation, C.V., = 9.6%) and
   higher peaking temperatures than the grass-thatch house. The mean
   relative humidity for the laboratory and screen house were 23% and
   32.5%, respectively, much lower than relative humidity in the incubator
   (73%). Relative humidity of the grass thatch hut (42%) and Iron roof hut
   (51%) were also lower than those of the incubator.
   The ookinete intensities for mosquitoes in the screen house (10.11 +/-
   1.79 ookinetes/midgut) were not statistically different (P = 0.41) from
   those held in the laboratory (7.50 +/- 1.19 ookinetes/midgut) or in the
   incubator (9.89 +/- 1.47 ookinetes/midgut). The holding environments
   influenced the oocyst infection rates (P = 0.04) that increased from
   8.4% in the screen house to 10.2% in the laboratory. The highest
   infection rate (12.5%) was observed in mosquitoes held in the incubator.
   However, the mean oocyst intensities in mosquitoes did not differ under
   these environments (P = 0.58). In the 'real village house' environments,
   the mean ookinete intensities were not statistically different between
   groups of mosquitoes compared to the incubator (P = 0.86). The oocyst
   infection rates observed in the highly fluctuating iron roof house were
   9.4% as compared to 9.0% and 6.9% in the more stable and constant
   habitats of grass thatch house and incubator, respectively. Results show
   that the natural microhabitats did not influence the infections rates in
   mosquitoes (P = 0.62). These findings indicate that the variation in
   temperatures prevailing in western Kenya particularly inside the village
   houses do not impede the development of malaria parasites in A. gambiae
   mosquitoes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Much interest exists in the extent to which constant versus fluctuating
   temperatures affect thermal performance traits and their phenotypic
   plasticity. Theory suggests that effects should vary with temperature,
   being especially pronounced at more extreme low (because of thermal
   respite) and high (because of Jensen's inequality) temperatures. Here we
   tested this idea by examining the effects of constant temperatures (10
   to 30 degrees C in 5 degrees C increments) and fluctuating temperatures
   (means equal to the constant temperatures, but with fluctuations of +/-
   5 degrees C) temperatures on the adult (F2) phenotypic plasticity of
   three thermal performance traits - critical thermal minimum (CTmin),
   critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and upper lethal temperature (ULT50)
   in ten species of springtails (Collembola) from three families
   (Isotomidae 7 spp.; Entomobryidae 2 spp.; Onychiuridae 1 sp.). The
   lowest mean CTmin value recorded here was -3.56 +/- 1.0 degrees C for
   Paristoma notabilis and the highest mean CTmax was 43.1 +/- 0.8 degrees
   C for Hemisotoma thermophila. The Acclimation Response Ratio for CTmin
   was on average 0.12 degrees C/degrees C (range: 0.04 to 0.21 degrees
   C/degrees C), but was much lower for CTmax (mean: 0.017 degrees
   C/degrees C, range: -0.015 to 0.047 degrees C/degrees C) and lower also
   for ULT50 (mean: 0.05 degrees C/degrees C, range: -0.007 to 0.14 degrees
   C/degrees C). Fluctuating versus constant temperatures typically had
   little effect on adult phenotypic plasticity, with effect sizes either
   no different from zero, or inconsistent in the direction of difference.
   Previous work assessing adult phenotypic plasticity of these thermal
   performance traits across a range of constant temperatures can thus be
   applied to a broader range of circumstances in springtails.

AB A major aim of the aquaculture industry in Norway is to develop
   sustainable farming of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. A great deal of
   research, including fanning trials and stock enhancement, has been
   performed on this species in Norway during the past two decades. The
   success of domestication of a new species depends on the genetic
   variability of the wild broodstock and the selection of appropriate
   genotypes for the fanning environment. Growth experiments under fanned
   conditions, including genetic analyses, were started as early as 1983
   after the breakthrough of cod juvenile production in mesocosm systems.
   At later stages (1988 and 1992 year classes), more detailed studies were
   conducted under farmed conditions. Based on individual tagging and
   genotyping (blood and white muscle biopsy sampling), estimates of growth
   performance (specific growth rate, SGR) of the various genotypes within
   six polymorphic protein loci were obtained. In general, the SGR in the
   two experiments varied through the year as a function of temperature and
   body size. In the 1988 year-class experiment, only a few statistically
   significant differences (ANOVA) were detected among genotypes, measured
   as mean weight and SGR. The 1992 year-class experiment included two
   different cod stocks, Northeast Arctic (NE) and Norwegian coastal (NC)
   cod, which were reared for about two years in the same net pen. Further,
   during this experiment, only a few genotypes exhibited significantly
   different growth within the NE group. No consistency was found in the
   variation with regard to protein loci investigated, growth periods
   studied, and relationship with temperature variation. (c) 2005

AB Understanding the potential for organisms to tolerate thermal stress
   through physiological or evolutionary responses is crucial given rapid
   climate change. Although climate models predict increases in both
   temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed
   under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature
   variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly
   Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm
   and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated
   heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive
   success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C)
   fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool
   fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations
   reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under
   warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees
   C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar
   fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was
   substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive
   success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments
   reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may
   constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins. Our data
   suggest that even small increases in temperature variability will
   threaten tropical ectotherms living close to their upper thermal limits,
   both through direct effects on fitness and by limiting their adaptive
   potential.

AB Although the effects of constant temperatures on hatchling traits have
   been extensively studied in reptiles, the effects of fluctuating
   temperatures remain poorly understood. Eggs of the Chinese three-keeled
   pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii) were incubated at a constant
   temperatures (28 degrees C) and two fluctuating temperatures (28 +/- 3
   degrees C and 28 +/- 6 degrees C) to test for the influence of thermal
   environment on incubation duration, hatchling traits, and post-hatching
   growth. Incubation duration was shorter at constant temperature than at
   fluctuating temperatures. The sex ratio of hatchlings varied among
   temperature treatments, with more females from 28 +/- 6 degrees C than
   from 28 degrees C. The size and mass were greater for hatchlings from a
   constant temperature than from fluctuating ones, but this difference in
   body size disappeared when the hatchlings were 3 months old. In
   addition, the swimming ability, survival, and growth of hatchlings from
   fluctuating temperatures did not differ from those of hatchlings from
   constant temperature, when they were kept at an artificial environment
   without food scarcity or predation. Therefore, the thermal environments
   with various temperature fluctuations used in this study do not
   significantly affect fitness-related hatchling traits in this species.

AB Thermal conditions at the beginning of the year determine the timing of
   pollen seasons of early flowering trees. The aims of this study were to
   quantify the relationship between the tree pollen season start dates and
   the thermal conditions just before the beginning of the season and to
   construct models predicting the start of the pollen season in a given
   year. The study was performed in Krakow (Southern Poland); the pollen
   data of Alnus, Corylus and Betula were obtained in 1991-2012 using a
   volumetric method. The relationship between the tree pollen season
   start, calculated by the cumulated pollen grain sum method, and a 5-day
   running means of maximum (for Alnus and Corylus) and mean (for Betula)
   daily temperature was found and used in the logistic regression models.
   The estimation of model parameters indicated their statistically
   significance for all studied taxa; the odds ratio was higher in models
   for Betula, comparing to Alnus and Corylus. The proposed model makes the
   accuracy of prediction in 83.58 % of cases for Alnus, in 84.29 % of
   cases for Corylus and in 90.41 % of cases for Betula. In years of model
   verification (2011 and 2012), the season start of Alnus and Corylus was
   predicted more precisely in 2011, while in case of Betula, the model
   predictions achieved 100 % of accuracy in both years. The correctness of
   prediction indicated that the data used for the model arrangement fitted
   the models well and stressed the high efficacy of model prediction
   estimated using the pollen data in 1991-2010.

AB Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to
   maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic
   effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal
   sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the
   consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in
   their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable
   conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental
   conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles
   from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity
   in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from
   environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal
   sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that
   differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24
   degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C).
   DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing
   DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats
   (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable
   habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the
   thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced
   plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a
   greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments.
   DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6
   degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal
   variability may favour some species while others are negatively
   impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by
   buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.

AB Temperature plays a critical role in the reproductive ecology of
   smallmouth bass, affecting factors such as the timing of spawning,
   offspring development and survival of the brood. Because temperature
   also influences the activity rates of fish. it has the potential to
   alter the chronology of parental care activities and possibly the
   immediate or future reproductive success of individual fish. We
   conducted a study in a thermal effluent canal on Lake Eric to examine
   the influence of fluctuating thermal regimes on parental care and
   reproductive success of smallmouth bass. In general, parental care
   activity of these smallmouth bass was higher than previously reported
   for non-thermally altered environments and did not follow conventional
   stage-specific patterns. In fact, individual fish exhibited very
   different patterns, with no consistency among individuals. Despite these
   behavioral alterations and the thermal instability in the canal, the
   reproductive success of smallmouth bass (i.e., the percentage of nesting
   males that successfully produced free-swimming fry) was high relative to
   other published values. Behavioral alterations observed were variable
   and did not conform with theory. However, the high level of reproductive
   success implies that fish are capable of adjusting energetic
   expenditures in response to a suite of conditions and risks. (C) 2003

AB The hydrogen peroxide (HP) crucible hypothesis proposed here holds that
   life began in a localized environment on Earth that was perfused with a
   flow of hydrogen peroxide from a sustained external source, which
   powered and mediated molecular evolution and the protocellular RNA
   world. In this article, we consolidate and review recent evidence, both
   circumstantial and tested in simulation in our work and in the
   laboratory in others' work, for its multiple roles in the evolution of
   the first living systems: (1) it provides a periodic power source as the
   thiosulfate-hydrogen peroxide (THP) redox oscillator, (2) it may act as
   an agent of molecular change and evolution and mediator of
   homochirality, and (3) the THP oscillator, subject to Brownian input
   perturbations, produces a weighted distribution of output thermal
   fluctuations that favor polymerization and chemical diversification over
   chemical degradation and simplification. The hypothesis can help to
   clarify the hero and villain roles of hydrogen peroxide in cell
   function, and on the singularity of life: of necessity, life evolved
   early an armory of catalases, the continuing, and all-pervasive presence
   of which prevents hydrogen peroxide from accumulating anywhere in
   sufficient quantities to host a second origin. The HP crucible
   hypothesis is radical, but based on well-known chemistry and physics, it
   is eminently testable in the laboratory, and many of our simulations

AB Insects can increase their resistance to cold stress by prior exposure
   to non-lethal cold temperatures. Here, we investigated the supercooling
   capacity and survival of eggs, 3rd and 5th instar larvae, and pupae of
   Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) during CA, and responses to
   various pre-treatment protocols, including constant temperatures,
   thermoperiods, and RCH, RHH, RCH + RHH and RHH + RCH combined with
   thermoperiods. Only acclimated eggs demonstrated a significant decrease
   in SCP, from -20.7 +/- 0.3 to -22.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C, among all
   experimental groups compared to non-acclimated stages. Survival
   increased by 17.5% for eggs, 40.0% and 13.3% for 3rd and 5th instar
   larvae, and by 20.0% for pupae after CA Compared to controls, survival
   of eggs under the conditions of thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C),
   thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) + RHH, and thermoperiod (5:15, 10:20, and
   15:25 degrees C) + RCH significantly increased. In addition, survival of
   3rd and 5th instar larvae and pupae increased under the conditions of
   thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) and thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) + RCH,
   possibly due to the induction of heat shock proteins or cryoprotectants.
   However, the pre-treatments of thermoperiod + RCH + RHH and thermoperiod
   + RHH + RCH did not significantly enhance survival of any developmental
   stage. These adaptive responses may allow S. exigua to enhance
   supercooling capacity and survival in response to seasonal or unexpected
   diurnal decreases in environmental temperatures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Temperature is a critical factor influencing avian phenology, due to its
   direct impact on food and water availability. Most previous studies have
   focused on the timing of spring migration and the arrival of birds at
   breeding grounds along the European and American flyways; little is
   known about migration ecology at the wintering sites along the Asian
   flyways. Using linear regression models, this study investigates how
   local temperature variation and EI Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   influences the arrival and departure timing of 9 waterbird species
   breeding in Mongolia or Siberia and overwintering in Poyang, China from
   2002 to 2013. Birds mainly arrive at Poyang in October and depart for
   their breeding sites in March. Out of the 9 species, 6 show a strong
   negative relationship between departure time and overwintering
   temperature in Poyang. Departure dates also show a negative association
   with overwintering ENSO and March ENSO for two species. Both local and
   large-scale climate indices show no influence on the arrival timing of
   waterbirds. We suggest that birds react to the annual variation of
   overwintering temperature: an earlier departure of waterbirds is
   facilitated by a warmer overwintering period and vice versa. The
   long-term accumulated temperature effect is more pronounced than ENSO
   and the short-term local temperature effect. Our findings could help
   quantify the potential impact of global warming on waterbirds.

AB SulfoSYS (Sulfolobus Systems Biology) focuses on the study of the CCM
   (central carbohydrate metabolism) of Sulfolobus solfataricus and its
   regulation under temperature variation at the systems level. in Archaea,
   carbohydrates are metabolized by modifications of the classical pathways
   known from Bacteria or Eukarya, e.g. the unusual branched ED
   (Entner-Doudoroff) pathway, which is utilized for glucose degradation in
   S. solfataricus. This archaeal model organism of choice is a
   thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon that optimally grows at 80 degrees C
   (60-92 degrees C) and pH 2-4. In general, life at high temperature
   requires very efficient adaptation to temperature changes, which is most
   difficult to deal with for organisms, and it is unclear how biological
   networks can withstand and respond to such changes. This integrative
   project combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic, as
   well as kinetic and biochemical information. The final goal of SulfoSYS
   is the construction of a silicon cell model for this part of the living
   cell that will enable computation of the CCM network. In the present
   paper, we report on one of the first archaeal systems biology projects.

AB Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of Hodgkin-Huxley
   neuron are investigated. A stable rotating spiral wave can be developed
   to occupy the quiescent areas in networks of neurons by selecting
   appropriate initial values for the variables in the networks of neurons.
   In our numerical studies, most neurons are quiescent and finite (few)
   numbers of neurons are selected with different values to form a spiral
   seed. In this way, neurons communicating are carried by propagating
   spiral wave to break through the quiescent domains (areas) in networks
   of neurons. The effect of membrane temperature on the formation of
   spiral wave is investigated by selecting different fixed membrane
   temperatures in the networks, and it is found that a spiral wave cannot
   be developed if the membrane temperature is close to a certain
   threshold. A quantitative factor of synchronization is defined to
   measure the statistical properties and collective behaviors of the
   spiral wave. And a distinct phase transition, which indicates the
   critical condition for spiral survival, is observed in the sudden
   changing point of the factors of synchronization curve vs. certain
   bifurcation parameter. Internal noise is introduced into ion channels
   (channel noise) with the Langevin method. It is found that a stable
   rotating spiral wave is developed and the spiral wave is robust to weak
   channel noise (the membrane patch is not small). The spiral wave can not
   grow up and the stable rotating spiral wave encounters instability in
   presence of strong channel noise. Coherence resonance-like behavior is
   observed in calculating the factors of synchronization in presence of
   channel noise.

AB Temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are key environmental
   drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to
   both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in
   the upregulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction
   of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive
   effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine
   physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore,
   antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to
   temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the
   interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits,
   Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity.
   We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature
   treatments (constant 18 degrees C, constant 28 degrees C and daily
   fluctuations between 18 and 28 degrees C) in the presence or absence of
   UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of
   Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that
   CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and
   UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR
   led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax.
   Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower
   level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the
   difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive
   effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial
   studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic
   processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to
   environmental variation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming exposes plants to severe heat stress, with consequent
   crop yield reduction. Organisms exposed to high temperature stresses
   typically protect themselves with a heat shock response (HSR), where
   accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the synthesis of heat shock
   proteins through the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. While the
   molecular mechanisms are qualitatively well characterized, our
   quantitative understanding of the underlying dynamics is still very
   limited. Here, we study the dynamics of HSR in the photosynthetic model
   organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a data-driven mathematical model
   of HSR. We based our dynamical model mostly on mass action kinetics,
   with a few nonlinear terms. The model was parametrized and validated by
   several independent datasets obtained from the literature. We
   demonstrate that HSR quantitatively and significantly differs if an
   increase in temperature of the same magnitude occurs abruptly, as often
   applied under laboratory conditions, or gradually, which would rather be
   expected under natural conditions. In contrast to rapid temperature
   increases, under gradual changes only negligible amounts of misfolded
   proteins accumulate, indicating that the HSR of C. reinhardtii
   efficiently avoids the accumulation of misfolded proteins under
   conditions most likely to prevail in nature. The mathematical model we
   developed is a flexible tool to simulate the HSR to different conditions
   and complements the current experimental approaches.

AB Time constraints can limit an animal's potential to survive in a given
   habitat and the maximum size of its group. Many studies have, therefore,
   investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling,
   foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than
   active, and understanding the determinants of this resting time may
   provide new insights into the habitat-specific time-budgeting problems
   that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that
   determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend
   resting, using data from a wide range of ecologically different species.
   However, total resting time consists of two components: enforced resting
   time (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free resting
   time (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional
   activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced resting
   time is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by
   temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this
   relationship show that enforced resting time distinguishes between
   locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show
   that an annual temperature increase of 2-4 degrees C would greatly
   increase enforced resting time, leading to serious time-budgeting
   problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced resting
   time on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong
   for folivorous primates. This study shows that resting time is an
   important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand
   extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa. (C) 2009 The

AB Metabarcoding is a time-saving and cost-effective approach that promises
   to overcome issues associated with traditional plankton taxonomy (i.e.
   lack of specialized personnel, time-consuming methodologies,
   difficulties in assignment of larval stages, and detection of cryptic
   species). In this regard, we applied metabarcoding using the 18S rDNA V9
   region to samples collected throughout 1 yr from the Estuary of Bilbao
   (Basque Country, Spain) in order to characterize the annual cycle of the
   eukaryotic plankton community. We found clear patterns of spatial and
   seasonal environmental variability that drive the distribution and
   abundance of the plankton assemblage throughout the year, thus
   confirming results of previous studies using microscopic identification
   of the planktonic species. Our results also suggest that the low oxygen
   period during summer in the inner part of the estuary (salinity 30) and
   the thermal variation from winter to summer are among the main
   environmental drivers of the plankton community of the Estuary of
   Bilbao. Finally, we report misidentification of some species (e.g.
   Cyclopina gracilis, Maristentor dinoferus), which highlights the need
   for more comprehensive reference sequence databases in order to overcome
   this limitation of metabarcoding.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Theory predicts that limited gene flow between
   populations will promote population differentiation, and experimental
   studies have found that differentiation is often explained by local
   adaptation in sexually reproducing angiosperms. However, few experiments
   have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in
   asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated
   the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an
   asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species.
   METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes
   among six populations that spanned the species' geographic range in the
   Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence
   rates were measured for 1 year.
   KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses
   to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have
   differentiated across the species' range. There was some evidence for
   local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient
   selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range
   edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the
   most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by
   decreasing minimum temperatures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly
   variable responses to transplantation across the species' range, and
   only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation.
   Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in
   fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts
   on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily
   distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit
   population-specific responses to global climate change that have not
   been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing
   angiosperms.

   organoleptic,VBN and the number of Pseudomonas spp. on tilapia are 5.9%

AB The development of cascade hydropower in the Yalong River has changed
   the hydrological regime of the river and sharply reduced the Coreius
   guichenoti population dwelling downstream of the JinPing II power
   station. In this paper, an eco-hydrological index system for C.
   guichenoti habitat was constructed based on Indicators of Hydrologic
   Alteration (IHA) and Environment Flow Components (EFC), which aimed to
   coordinate the processes of ecological hydrological and water
   temperature variations to guarantee the oviposition of C. guichenoti.
   The analysis revealed that the suitable rise rate and fall rate
   intervals, which are dimensionless parameters, were 0.05-0.10 and
   0.01-0.03, respectively, during the spawning period. The rise and fall
   durations were both 1-2 days, the cycle of water fluctuations was 3-5
   days, the flow pulse duration was 5-7 days, the flow pulse rise rate was
   0.56-0.65, and the flow pulse fall rate was 0.23-0.50. Then, the
   Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) method was used to
   calculate the ecological base flow during the C. guichenoti spawning
   period. Moreover, the ecological flow regime for C. guichenoti
   downstream of the JinPing II power station during the spawning period
   was determined based on eco-hydrological indicators and water
   temperature requirements. These results showed that the ecological flow
   regime could not only guarantee oviposition but also meet the drifting
   conditions required for eggs, and therefore, the ecological operation of
   diversion-type hydropower stations and cascade hydropower stations needs
   to be given more attention to provide suitable spawning conditions in
   target fish habitats.

AB Climatic means with different degrees of variability (delta) may change
   in the future and could significantly impact ectotherm species fitness.
   Thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the effects of
   changes in means and variances of temperature on traits of climatic
   stress resistance. Here, we examined short-term (within-generation)
   variation in mean temperature (23, 25, and 27 degrees C) at three levels
   of diel thermal fluctuations (delta = 1, 3, or 5 degrees C) on an
   invasive pest insect, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata
   (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Using the adult flies, we address
   the hypothesis that temperature variability may affect the climatic
   stress resistance over and above changes in mean temperature at constant
   variability levels. We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal
   tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water
   balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to
   each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results
   showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in
   addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored.
   Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the
   traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios
   dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress
   resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest
   that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which
   in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in
   conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have
   stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated
   temperatures alone. The results of this study therefore have significant
   implications for understanding insect responses to climate change and
   suggest that analyses or simulations of only mean temperature variation
   may be inappropriate for predicting population-level responses under
   future climate change scenarios despite their widespread use.

AB Temperature is one of the main factors that influences cardiovascular
   functioning in ectotherms. Hence this study sought to investigate heart
   rate responses of a freshwater crab species, Poppiana dentata, to
   different temperature exposures since the species generally reside in
   habitats of fluctuating physicochemistry. Heart rates were
   non-invasively determined in juvenile crabs for three temperature
   regimes, each over an 8-day session; A: temperature exposures of 26
   degrees C (2 days) to 30 degrees C (3 days) to 26 degrees C (3 days), B:
   26 degrees C (2 days) to 32 degrees C (3 days) to 26 degrees C (3 days)
   and C: a control at constant 26 degrees C. I kart rate variations were
   significant among the regimes (P < 0.05), with the median heart rate
   being highest for regime B (74 beats per minute or bpm) during the
   temperature insult (32 degrees C), relative to regime A (70 bpm) and the
   control (64 bpm). Notably, a suppression and inversion of the diurnal
   cardiac patterns occurred for regimes' A and B crabs respectively, with
   rates from the highest temperature insult not shifting back to
   pre-insult levels during recovery (26 degrees C). It is plausible that
   P. dentata may have compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms that account
   for these differential heart rate responses, possibly conveying adaptive
   strategies in its dynamic habitat conditions.

AB We studied the occurrence of large high frequency temperature
   fluctuations and their potential association with settlement of
   intertidal invertebrates during the spring/summer period 1999/2000 at
   Las Cruces, on the coast of central Chile. Our results showed the
   existence of internal tidal bores, characterized by sharp drops in water
   temperature at the surface and near the bottom, and subsequent
   temperature increases, which occurred with a semidiurnal periodicity.
   Measured currents support the hypothesis of alternating onshore and
   offshore movement of warm-water fronts. The frequency of the events
   varied through the summer and their amplitude seems to be modulated by
   onshore winds. The strongest events were observed when strong onshore
   winds occurred in late afternoon hours and the entire water column
   showed a semidiurnal temperature signal. Highest values of chlorophyll
   concentration in the intertidal zone and daily settlement of bivalves,
   gastropods and crustaceans were observed at times when conditions were
   favorable for occurrence of internal tidal bores. Results suggest that
   internal tidal bore warm fronts could play an important role in the
   transport of neustonic larval invertebrates and the delivery of
   phytoplankton to at least some intertidal sites along the coast of
   Chile. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   investigated by detection of viral RNA in homogenates of pools of both
   head/thorax and saliva by reverse transcription real-time polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR). Culex pipiens was susceptible to WNV NY99 only,
   whereas both virus strains could be detected in Ae. japonicus, with the
   additional isolation of WNV NY99 in Vero cell culture from one saliva
   pool. Given the high abundances of Ae. japonicus in many newly colonized
   areas, its recently demonstrated broad host range, including mammalian
   and avian blood hosts, and its vector competence, this species is a
   potential key bridge vector of WNV in Central Europe.

AB Most research in physiological ecology has focused on the effects of
   mean changes in temperature under the classic "hot vs cold" acclimation
   treatment; however, current evidence suggests that an increment in both
   the mean and variance of temperature could act synergistically to
   amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it
   would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic
   organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of
   temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted
   water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments
   were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD
   (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to
   daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)),
   and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the "vertical
   shift or faster-slower" hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming
   performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under
   more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second,
   there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by
   means of significant repeatability estimates.
   Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant
   acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal
   performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual
   organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation
   acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of
   physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary
   responses to global change.

AB Thermal tolerance is one of the major determinants of successful
   establishment and spread of invasive aliens. Merizodus soledadinus
   (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was accidentally introduced to Kerguelen from
   the Falkland Islands in 1913. On Kerguelen, the climate is cooler than
   the Falklands Islands but has been getting warmer since the 1990s, in
   synchrony with the rapid expansion of M. soledadinus. We aimed to
   investigate the thermal sensitivity in adults of M. soledadinus and
   hypothesised that climate warming has assisted the colonisation process
   of M. soledadinus. We examined (1) survival of constant low temperatures
   and at fluctuating thermal regimes, (2) the critical thermal limits
   (CTmin and CTmax) of acclimated individuals (4, 8 and 16A degrees C),
   (3) the metabolic rates of acclimated adults at temperatures from 0 to
   16A degrees C. The FTRs moderately increased the duration of survival
   compared to constant cold exposure. M. soledadinus exhibited an activity
   window ranged from -5.5 +/- A 0.3 to 38 +/- A 0.5A degrees C. The Q (10)
   after acclimation to temperatures ranging from 0 to 16A degrees C was
   2.49. Our work shows that this species is only moderately cold tolerant
   with little thermal plasticity. The CTmin of M. soledadinus are close to
   the low temperatures experienced in winter on Kerguelen Islands, but the
   CTmax are well above summer conditions, suggesting that this species has
   abundant scope to deal with current climate change.

AB Under future climates, leaf temperature (T-l) will be higher and more
   variable. This will affect plant carbon (C) balance because
   photosynthesis and respiration both respond to short-term (subdaily)
   fluctuations in T-l and acclimate in the longer term (days to months).
   This study asks the question: To what extent can the potential and speed
   of photosynthetic acclimation buffer leaf C gain from rising and
   increasing variable T-l? We quantified how increases in the mean and
   variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO2
   assimilation rates, A(net); its variability; and time under near-optimal
   photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this
   aim, the probability distribution of A(net) was obtained by combining a
   probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in T-l with
   data on A(net) responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and
   111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a)
   expected increases in T-l variability will decrease mean A(net) and
   increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean T-l depend
   on species and initial T-l, and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of
   leaf warming, maintaining A(net) at >80% of its maximum under most
   thermal regimes.

AB Plants are exposed to varying irradiance and temperature within a day
   and from day to day. We previously investigated metabolism in a
   temperature-controlled greenhouse at the spring equinox on both a cloudy
   and a sunny day [daily light integral (DLI) of 7 mol M-2 d(-1) and 12
   mol m(-2) d(-1)]. Diel metabolite profiles were largely captured in
   sinusoidal simulations at similar DLIs in controlled-environment
   chambers, except that amino acids were lower in natural light regimes.
   We now extend the DLI12 study by investigating metabolism in a natural
   light regime with variable temperature including cool nights. Starch was
   not completely turned over, anthocyanins and proline accumulated, and
   protein content rose. Instead of decreasing, amino acid content rose.
   Connectivity in central metabolism, which decreased in variable light,
   was not further weakened by variable temperature. We propose that diel
   metabolism operates better when light and temperature are co-varying. We
   also compared transcript abundance of 10 circadian clock genes in this
   temperature-variable regime with the temperature-controlled natural and
   sinusoidal light regimes. Despite temperature compensation, peak timing
   and abundance for dawn- and day-phased genes and GIGANTEA were slightly
   modified in the variable temperature treatment. This may delay dawn
   clock activity until the temperature rises enough to support rapid
   metabolism and photosynthesis.

AB Background and Aims In and environments many plant species are found
   associated with the canopies of woody perennials. Favourable conditions
   for establishment under canopies are likely to be associated with shade,
   but under canopies shade is distributed patchily and differs in quality.
   Diurnal temperature fluctuations and maximum temperatures could be
   reliable indicators of safe sites. Here, an examination is made as to
   whether canopy-associated species use temperature cues to germinate in
   shade patches, rather than matrix areas between trees.
   Methods The study was carried out in and southern Kalahari savannah
   (Republic of South Africa). Perennial and annual species associated with
   Acacia erioloba trees and matrix species were germinated at temperature
   regimes resembling shaded and unshaded conditions. Soil temperature was
   measured in the field.
   Key Results Germination of all fleshy-fruited perennial
   acacia-associated species and two annual acacia-associated species was
   inhibited by the temperature regime resembling unshaded conditions
   compared with at least one of the regimes resembling shaded conditions.
   Inhibition in perennials decreased with seed mass, probably reflecting
   that smaller seedlings are more vulnerable to drought. Germination of
   matrix species was not inhibited by the unshaded temperature regime and
   in several cases it increased germination compared with shaded
   temperature regimes or constant temperature. Using phylogenctically
   independent contrasts a significant positive relationship was found
   between canopy association and the germination at shade temperatures
   relative to unshaded temperatures.
   Conclusions The data support the hypothesis that canopy species have
   developed mechanisms to prevent germination in open sun conditions. The
   results and data from the literature show that inhibition of germination
   at temperature regimes characteristic of open sun conditions can be
   found in fleshy-fruited species of widely divergent taxonomic groups. It
   is predicted that germination mechanisms to detect canopy shade based on
   temperature cues are widespread in species depending on nurse plants,
   especially bird-dispersed species.

AB Extreme climatic events are predicted to increase in severity as a
   consequence of anthropogenic climate change. In marine ecosystems, the
   importance of marine heatwaves (MHWs) - discrete periods of anomalously
   high sea temperatures - is gaining recognition. In 2011, the
   highest-magnitude MHW ever recorded impacted the west coast of Australia
   (southeast Indian Ocean). The MHW was associated with widespread
   mortality of habitat-forming species, including corals and kelps, and
   structural changes in assemblages of macroalgae and fish. However, the
   responses of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages have not yet been
   fully documented. Here, we resurveyed 2 subtidal habitat types (reef
   'flats' and 'slopes') at 4 locations (spanning > 800 km of coastline and
   > 6 degrees of latitude) during the period 1999-2015 to examine the
   effects of the 2011 MHW on herbivorous macroinvertebrates (i. e. sea
   urchins, gastropod molluscs). Responses to the MHW varied with latitude;
   at our warmest study location, abundances were severely depleted,
   whereas no effects were detected at the coolest location. Across the
   entire study region, subtle but significant shifts in assemblage
   structure were observed due to decreased abundances of more
   southerly-distributed species (i. e. 'cool' affinity) and increased
   abundances of several more northerly-distributed species (i. e. 'warm'
   affinity). The 2011 MHW has had profound effects on the marine biota off
   the west coast of Australia, across multiple trophic levels and
   taxonomic groups. Here, as in many other regions, contemporary warming
   events are superimposed onto gradual warming trends, increasing the
   likelihood of abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning.

AB Environmental adaptability is essential for plant survival. Though it is
   well known that a simple cooling or cold shock leads to Ca2+ signals,
   direct evidence has not been provided that plants use Ca2+ signals as a
   second messenger in the cold acclimation (CA) process in the field. By
   developing a technique to analyze Ca2+ signals using confocal
   cryomicroscopy, we investigated Ca2+ signals under several temperature
   conditions by combining the start temperature, cooling rate and cooling
   time duration. In both root and leaf cells, Ca2+ signals rapidly
   disappeared after cooling stopped, and thereafter under a constant low
   temperature no Ca2+ signal was observed. Interestingly, under the
   cooling regime from 2 degrees C to -2 degrees C, non-acclimated plants
   grown at 23 degrees C hardly showed Ca2+ signals, but cold-acclimated
   plants at 2 degrees C were able to form Ca2+ signals in root cells.
   These findings suggest that plants sense temperature decreases with Ca2+
   signals while adjusting the temperature sensitivity to their own
   temperature environment. Furthermore, if the temperature is constant, no
   Ca2+ signal is induced even during CA. Then, we also focused on the CA
   under field conditions, rich in temperature fluctuations. In CA under
   field conditions, the expression patterns of CBF/DREB1 genes were
   distinctly different from those in artificial CA. Pharmacological
   studies with Ca2+ channel blockers showed that the Ca2+-induced
   expression of CBF/DREB1 genes was closely correlated with the amplitude
   of temperature fluctuation, suggesting that Ca2+ signals regulate
   CBF/DREB1 gene expression during CA under natural conditions.

AB The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) varies
   significantly in individual growth rates and life-history traits
   (maturation, reproduction, and survival) among adjacent populations in
   nature. This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental
   components of the substantial among-population variation in growth
   rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either
   mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a
   common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet,
   frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were
   identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures
   (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in
   nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore
   snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to
   affect first-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in
   the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in
   the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were
   gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in
   environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both
   that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that
   these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small
   geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for
   large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These
   results are considered in the context of population colonization
   history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate
   variation.

AB Changes in the environment are expected to induce changes in the
   quantitative genetic variation, which influences the ability of a
   population to adapt to environmental change. Furthermore, environmental
   changes are not constant in time, but fluctuate. Here, we investigate
   the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes
   in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution
   experiment followed by a split-brood experiment. In line with
   expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall
   higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the
   environment. After selection in an environment with increasing
   temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and
   environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were
   added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation
   decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that
   fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a
   population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment
   with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and
   the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a
   low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity.
   Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity
   after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve
   is facilitated after exposure to environmental fluctuations. Our study
   highlights that environmental fluctuations should be considered when
   investigating the response of a population to environmental change.

AB Ectotherms are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate
   warming. Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in
   climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions.
   Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are
   exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we
   highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate realized' thermal
   reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the fundamental' norms derived
   under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model
   organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes
   such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under
   cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum
   temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial
   insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should
   alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing thermal
   safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have
   generally been ignored in the climate change literature.

AB Global climate change is leading to asymmetric atmospheric warming with
   reduced temperature differences between day and night. This has an
   increasing influence on crop plants. However, little is known about the
   physiology of high night temperature (HNT) effects and natural variation
   in HNT susceptibility. Twelve rice cultivars were investigated under HNT
   (30 degrees C day/28 degrees C night) and control (28 degrees C day/21
   degrees C night) conditions. Chlorosis was observed under HNT and used
   to classify relative sensitivity of cultivars. The resulting mean
   sensitivity rank correlated significantly with seed yield under HNT (r =
   -0.547). Wide variability in HNT tolerance led to an increase in shoot
   FW and DW in tolerant, but decreased plant growth in sensitive
   cultivars. Growth parameters correlated negatively with HNT sensitivity.
   Respiration rate was significantly increased under HNT at the end of
   night for several cultivars 34 DAS and 41 DAS and for all cultivars 66
   DAS whereas photosynthetic quantum yield was not influenced. Negative
   correlations of sensitivity rank with respiration rate at two time
   points under HNT (r = -0.305; r = -0.265) exclude higher respiration
   rates in sensitive cultivars as a primary cause for HNT sensitivity.
   Monosaccharide and starch concentrations of leaves were increased after
   16 days of HNT, while sucrose was not affected. Additionally tolerant
   cultivars showed a higher increase of monosaccharide concentrations
   during the day under HNT compared with control conditions. While HNT did
   not lead to carbon depletion in rice leaves, tolerant cultivars coped
   better with HNT, enabling them to accumulate more carbohydrates than
   sensitive cultivars with leaves affected by chlorosis.

AB To document the spatial and temporal variation of environmental signals
   inducing seed germination in temperate forests, we measured temporal
   patterns of environmental signals and seed germination of six pioneer
   tree species in unthinned and thinned stands of conifer forests
   (Cryptomeria japonica plantations) and in the understory and gaps of
   hardwood forests in Japan. We also conducted germination experiment in
   laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of
   red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed
   germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density
   (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in
   thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those
   of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor
   also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a
   result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to
   unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little
   differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These
   findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter
   accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer
   species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None
   of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned
   stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the
   understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were
   high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to
   canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic
   species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature
   fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the
   thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly
   identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental
   signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached
   minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the
   PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due
   to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these
   temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic
   species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the
   environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer
   species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests,
   particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals,
   PPFD, R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations, appear
   to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent
   species diversity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in
   multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal
   maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms)
   traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported
   adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution
   of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower
   model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the
   thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments.
   Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with
   populations from colder and less thermally variable environments
   exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a
   narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal
   temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either
   mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the
   complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural
   populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective
   force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the

   rearrangement caused by the cortex-lipid bilayer coupling under thermal

   actin-spectrin cortex, (2) the lipid bilayer, and (3) the trans membrane
   protein band 3 and their course-consequence relations were considered in
   the context of the cortex non linear stiffening and corresponding
   anomalous nature of energy dissipation. The fluctuations induce
   alternating expansion and compression of the membrane parts in order to
   ensure surface and volume conservation. The membrane structural changes
   were considered within two time regimes. The results indicate that the
   cortex non linear stiffening and corresponding anomalous nature of
   energy dissipation are related to the spectrin flexibility distribution
   and the rate of its changes. The spectrin flexibility varies from purely
   flexible to semi flexible. It is influenced by: (1) the number of band 3
   molecules attached to single spectrin filaments, and (2) phosphorylation
   of the actin-junctions. The rate of spectrin flexibility changes depends
   on the band 3 molecules rearrangement.

AB Species' responses to environmental changes such as global warming are
   affected not only by trends in mean conditions, but also by natural and
   human-induced environmental fluctuations. Methods are needed to predict
   how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary
   processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve
   biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and
   empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in
   environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects
   population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent
   claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance
   can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates.
   Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects
   of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental
   variance remains constant, omitting it from population models
   compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in
   mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of
   environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses
   to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic
   history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global
   change under future environmental variability.

AB The typical short generation length of insects makes their population
   dynamics highly sensitive not only to mean annual temperatures but also
   to their intra-annual variations. To consider the combined effect of
   both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling
   framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic
   weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species
   population responses to inter-and intra-annual temperature changes. This
   framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of
   Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple
   agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three
   locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions:
   Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain), and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We
   produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing
   current and future (mid-21st century) climatic conditions under two
   emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a
   significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in
   population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in
   all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the
   summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in
   population size. High variability in population size was observed
   between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong
   effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from
   late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early
   summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that
   earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased
   populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is
   highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of
   open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40 degrees during the next
   50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on
   mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better
   to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change
   while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose a
   modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual
   temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for
   pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and
   agricultural ecosystems.

AB Understanding susceptibility to bleaching may indicate how corals cope
   with increasing seawater temperatures resulting from climate change. In
   Belle Mare lagoon, Mauritius, Acropora muricata colonies at reef sites
   but not near the coast exhibited bleaching. We compared seawater
   temperatures and light intensity both on a summer day and a winter day
   at a reef station and a near-coast station. The total phenolic contents,
   non-enzymatic antioxidant activities of the coral holobiont, in situ
   photophysiological parameters of in hospite Symbiodinium as well as
   their cladal diversity were assessed. Both sites had comparable maximum
   temperatures but fluctuations were higher in the near-coast station (2-3
   A degrees C) compared to the reef station (1-1.5 A degrees C) on both
   days. Light intensity was higher on the summer day than the winter day
   at both stations. Higher total phenolic contents and ferrous reducing
   antioxidant potential were observed in near-coast colonies than in reef
   colonies on the summer day. Only Clade A-like Symbiodinium sp. variants
   were detected at both locations, but higher maximum relative electron
   transport rates and maximum non-photochemical quenching were measured in
   near-coast colonies. Our data show that the near-coast colonies
   exhibited enhanced photophysiological responses, antioxidant activities
   and increased total phenolic contents in response to higher thermal and
   light fluctuations. This acclimatization may explain the variability in
   bleaching along a coast-reef scale.

AB Geographic variation in thermal environment may significantly influence
   the energetics of ectotherms, and thus may serve as a mechanism for
   geographic variation in growth and reproduction. Thermal environment
   affects body temperature (T-b) that, in turn, has consequences both for
   the amount of time available for surface activities such as foraging,
   and for physiological processes such as metabolism I studied effects of
   differences in thermal environment on T-b, surface use, and resting
   metabolism of mottled rock rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus) from two
   populations (Boquillas: BOQ, and Grapevine Hills: GVH) in Big Bend
   National Park, Texas. Snakes in these populations differed in growth
   rate and adult body size, and these differences may be related to the
   influence of thermal environment on energetics. During summer months,
   operative environmental temperatures at BOQ were hotter than at GVH.
   Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures resulted in approximate to 64%
   less time available for diurnal surface use (e.g., foraging) at BOQ
   relative to GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures also constrained
   the average T-b of BOQ snakes at night to be from 2 degrees C to 4.5
   degrees C hotter than GVH snakes during July and August. Despite hotter
   T-b, estimated resting metabolic expenditures of BOQ snakes during July
   and August were similar to estimated expenditures of GVH snakes because
   BOQ snakes had lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Results of this
   study were consistent with the hypothesis of greater energy limitation
   at BOQ, and underscored the importance of population-specific data for
   understanding geographic variation in energy acquisition and allocation.

AB Competition for fresh water between agriculture and domestic and
   industrial uses is increasing worldwide. This is forcing subsistence and
   commercial agriculture to produce more with less water. Consequently, it
   is crucial to properly and efficiently manage water resources. This
   requires accurate determination of crop water loss into the atmosphere,
   which is greatly influenced by the exchange of energy and mass between
   the surface and the atmosphere. Measurement of these exchange processes
   can best be accomplished by micrometeorological methods. However, most
   micrometeorological methods are very expensive, difficult to set up,
   require extensive post-data collection corrections and/or involve a high
   degree of empiricism. This review discusses estimation of
   evapotranspiration using relatively inexpensive micrometeorological
   methods in temperature-variance (TV), surface renewal (SR) and
   mathematical models. The TV and SR methods use high frequency air
   temperature measurements above a surface to estimate sensible heat flux
   (H). The latent heat flux (lambda E), and hence evapotranspiration, is
   calculated as a residual of the shortened surface energy balance using
   measured or estimated net radiation and soil heat flux, assuming surface
   energy balance closure is met. For crops with incomplete cover, the
   disadvantage of these methods is that they do not allow separation of
   evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and plant transpiration. The
   mathematical models (single-and dual-source) involve a combination of
   radiation and resistance equations to determine evapotranspiration from
   inputs of automatic weather station observations. Single-source models
   (Penman-Monteith type equations) are used to determine
   evapotranspiration over homogeneous surfaces. The dual-source models,
   basically an extension of single-source models, determine soil
   evaporation and plant transpiration separately over heterogeneous or
   sparse vegetation. These mathematical models have also been modified to
   accommodate inputs of remotely-sensed radiometric surface temperatures
   that enable estimation of evapotranspiration on a regional and global
   scale.

AB Genetic prerequisites for the evolution of sexual dimorphism,
   sex-specific heritabilities and low or negative genetic correlations
   between homologous traits in males and females are rarely found.
   However, sexual dimorphism is evolving rapidly following environmental
   change, suggesting that sexual dimorphism and its genetic background
   could be environmentally sensitive. Yet few studies have explored the
   sensitivity of the genetic background of sexual dimorphism on
   environmental variation. In this study, on Drosophila melanogaster, we
   used a large nested full-sibhalf-sib breeding design where families were
   split into four different developmental temperatures: two constant
   temperature treatments of 25 and 30 degrees C and two cycling
   temperatures with means of 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. After
   emergence, we tested heat shock tolerance of adult flies. We found that
   sexual dimorphism was strongly affected by temperature during
   development. Moreover, we found that female heritability was
   significantly lower in flies developing at hot temperature and more so
   under hot and cycling temperatures. Interestingly, most of the genetic
   variation for heat shock tolerance was orthogonal (i.e. noncorrelated)
   between sexes, allowing independent evolution of heat shock tolerance in
   males and females. These findings give support to the hypothesis that
   the evolution of sexual dimorphism can be influenced by the environments
   experienced during development.

AB Seed dormancy and size are two important life-history traits that
   interplay as adaptation to varying environmental settings. As evolution
   of both traits involves correlated selective pressures, it is of
   interest to comparatively investigate the evolution of the two traits
   jointly as well as independently. We explore evolutionary trajectories
   of seed dormancy and size using adaptive dynamics in scenarios of
   deterministic or stochastic temperature variations. Ecological dynamics
   usually result in unbalanced population structures, and temperature
   shifts or fluctuations of high magnitude give rise to more balanced
   ecological structures. When only seed dormancy evolves, it is
   counter-selected and temperature shifts hasten this evolution. Evolution
   of seed size results in the fixation of a given strategy and evolved
   seed size decreases when seed dormancy is lowered. When coevolution is
   allowed, evolutionary variations are reduced while the speed of
   evolution becomes faster given temperature shifts. Such coevolution
   scenarios systematically result in reduced seed dormancy and size and
   similar unbalanced population structures. We discuss how this may be
   linked to the system stability. Dormancy is counter-selected because
   population dynamics lead to stable equilibrium, while small seeds are
   selected as the outcome of size-number trade-offs. Our results suggest
   that unlike random temperature variation between generations,
   temperature shifts with high magnitude can considerably alter population
   structures and accelerate life-history evolution. This study increases
   our understanding of plant evolution and persistence in the context of
   climate changes.
