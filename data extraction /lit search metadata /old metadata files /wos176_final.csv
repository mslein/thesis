Amarasekare_2012_AMERNATU,"Amarasekare, Priyanga and Savage, Van",A Framework for Elucidating the Temperature Dependence of Fitness,AMERICAN NATURALIST,10.1086/663677,2012,"Climate warming is predicted to cause large-scale extinctions, particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer to the temperature at which fitness is maximized (T-opt) and an upper temperature limit for survival (T-max) that is closer to T-opt than do temperate species. Thus, even a small increase in environmental temperature could put tropical ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework to partition the temperature response of fitness into its components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness declines at high temperatures because the temperature responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways: fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase. The proximity of T-opt to T-max depends on how the temperature response of development mediates the interaction between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which causes fitness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures exceed T-opt. The model correctly predicts empirically observed fitness-temperature relationships in insects from different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the latitudinal differences in fitness responses.",0003-0147,a Framework for Elucidating the Temperature Dependence of Fitness.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,
Amarasekare_2013_JOOFANEC,"Amarasekare, Priyanga and Coutinho, Renato M.",The intrinsic growth rate as a predictor of population viability under climate warming,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2656.12112,2013,"1. Lately, there has been interest in using the intrinsic growth rate (rm) to predict the effects of climate warming on ectotherm population viability. However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a stage-structured population model that realistically captures the temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years. As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g. changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g. reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes). As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow relative to the developmental period of the organism (003-005 degrees C per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 01 degrees C per year). The Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short time-scales and under slow warming regimes.",0021-8790,The Intrinsic Growth Rate as a Predictor of Population Viability under Climate Warming.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as a consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal performance curves (TPCs) describing population growth in fluctuating environments can be predicted quantitatively based on TPCs generated in constant laboratory conditions. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes.

Freshwater turtles have long been used to characterize the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying TSD and provide a great system to investigate how changing climatic conditions will affect vertebrates with TSD. Unfortunately, most of what we know about the mechanisms underlying TSD comes from laboratory conditions that do not accurately mimic natural conditions (i.e., constant incubation temperatures and supraphysiological steroid manipulations). In this paper, we review recent advances in our understanding of how TSD operates in nature that arose from studies using more natural fluctuating incubation temperatures and natural variation in maternal estrogens within the yolk. By incorporating more natural conditions into laboratory studies, we are better able to use these studies to predict how changing climatic conditions will affect species with TSD.",2471-5638,Temperature Fluctuations and Maternal Estrogens as Critical Factors for Understanding Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination in Nature.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various '-omics' techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be explored more thoroughly. Although FTR is not ecologically relevant, similar processes may operate in settings where temperatures fluctuate naturally.",0022-0949,Mechanisms Underpinning the Beneficial Effects of Fluctuating Thermal Regimes in Insect Cold Tolerance.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

The implications for the ecosystem services these populations provide, including food production from marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures. Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields, but current levels of functional diversity (FD) of targeted species, measured using traits related to species' responses to temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high FD of catch could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8% relative to projections if FD were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast, species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, but that FD can buffer these negative impacts.",0962-8452,Functional Diversity of Catch Mitigates Negative Effects of Temperature Variability on Fisheries Yields.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

For oviparous sauropsid species, temperature within the nest influences gonadal sexual differentiation during a small window of embryogenesis called the thermosensitive period (TSP). The absence of sexual dimorphic characteristic in juveniles of TSD species coupled with the lack of a non-invasive method to determine sex is a great obstacle to studies estimating sex-ratios under natural conditions. Some authors have proposed proxies of sex-ratio obtained through correlative approaches. They commonly extrapolate the empirical profile of sex-ratios as a function of constant incubation temperature established for several species in the laboratory to a field context. However, most of these proxies have been refuted by studies realized under field conditions, and consequently they cannot be used to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. Here, we propose a new thermal model of TSD using a mechanistic approach. We built this model from a collection of published data of physiological processes (i.e. the growth of the embryo, the growth of gonads and the activity of the enzyme aromatase) underlying the TSD mechanism, for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). This new approach provides integration of incubation temperature fluctuations, as well as the cumulative and differential effect of high and low temperatures on sexual differentiation to embryo sex determination. The significant consistency obtained between observed and predicted sex-ratios both at diverse constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures provides hope to develop an efficient method to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. The reliable validity of this new model could have wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the TSD mechanism, as well as its evolutionary and ecological consequences in natural populations.",0269-8463,a Mechanistic Model of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination in a Chelonian: The European Pond Turtle.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

Favourable conditions for establishment under canopies are likely to be associated with shade, but under canopies shade is distributed patchily and differs in quality. Diurnal temperature fluctuations and maximum temperatures could be reliable indicators of safe sites. Here, an examination is made as to whether canopy-associated species use temperature cues to germinate in shade patches, rather than matrix areas between trees. Methods The study was carried out in and southern Kalahari savannah (Republic of South Africa). Perennial and annual species associated with Acacia erioloba trees and matrix species were germinated at temperature regimes resembling shaded and unshaded conditions. Soil temperature was measured in the field. Key Results Germination of all fleshy-fruited perennial acacia-associated species and two annual acacia-associated species was inhibited by the temperature regime resembling unshaded conditions compared with at least one of the regimes resembling shaded conditions. Inhibition in perennials decreased with seed mass, probably reflecting that smaller seedlings are more vulnerable to drought. Germination of matrix species was not inhibited by the unshaded temperature regime and in several cases it increased germination compared with shaded temperature regimes or constant temperature. Using phylogenctically independent contrasts a significant positive relationship was found between canopy association and the germination at shade temperatures relative to unshaded temperatures. Conclusions The data support the hypothesis that canopy species have developed mechanisms to prevent germination in open sun conditions. The results and data from the literature show that inhibition of germination at temperature regimes characteristic of open sun conditions can be found in fleshy-fruited species of widely divergent taxonomic groups. It is predicted that germination mechanisms to detect canopy shade based on temperature cues are widespread in species depending on nurse plants, especially bird-dispersed species.",0305-7364,Seeds Use Temperature Cues to Ensure Germination under Nurse-Plant Shade in Xeric Kalahari Savannah.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

However, few studies have isolated the specific mechanisms that create and maintain this diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between water temperature in streams used for spawning and genetic diversity at a gene involved in immune function [the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)] in 14 populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) sampled across the Wood River basin in south-western Alaska. The largest influence on MHC diversity was lake basin, but we also found a significant positive correlation between average water temperature and MHC diversity. This positive relationship between temperature and MHC diversity appears to have been produced by natural selection at very local scales rather than neutral processes, as no correlation was observed between temperature and genetic diversity at 90 neutral markers. Additionally, no significant relationship was observed between temperature variability and MHC diversity. Although lake basin was the largest driver of differences in MHC diversity, our results also demonstrate that fine-scale differences in water temperature may generate variable selection regimes in populations that spawn in habitats separated by as little as 1km. Additionally, our results indicated that some populations may be reaching a maximum level of MHC diversity. We postulate that salmon from populations in warm streams may delay spawning until late summer to avoid thermal stress as well as the elevated levels of pathogen prevalence and virulence associated with warm temperatures earlier in the summer.",1010-061X,Major Histocompatibility Complex Diversity is Positively Associated with Stream Water Temperatures in Proximate Populations of Sockeye Salmon.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

As evolution of both traits involves correlated selective pressures, it is of interest to comparatively investigate the evolution of the two traits jointly as well as independently. We explore evolutionary trajectories of seed dormancy and size using adaptive dynamics in scenarios of deterministic or stochastic temperature variations. Ecological dynamics usually result in unbalanced population structures, and temperature shifts or fluctuations of high magnitude give rise to more balanced ecological structures. When only seed dormancy evolves, it is counter-selected and temperature shifts hasten this evolution. Evolution of seed size results in the fixation of a given strategy and evolved seed size decreases when seed dormancy is lowered. When coevolution is allowed, evolutionary variations are reduced while the speed of evolution becomes faster given temperature shifts. Such coevolution scenarios systematically result in reduced seed dormancy and size and similar unbalanced population structures. We discuss how this may be linked to the system stability. Dormancy is counter-selected because population dynamics lead to stable equilibrium, while small seeds are selected as the outcome of size-number trade-offs. Our results suggest that unlike random temperature variation between generations, temperature shifts with high magnitude can considerably alter population structures and accelerate life-history evolution.

Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.",0022-0949,Measurement and Modelling of Primary Sex Ratios for Species with Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

Our method is based on a first order exponential transformation of a time series of temperatures to yield an exponentially-weighted mean temperature characteristic of the regime and independent of any particular species or end point. The resulting effective temperature or exponential mean, 7, offers an improved method for summarizing mean temperature where biological response scales exponentially to temperature. The exponential mean allows growth under varying thermal regimes to be predicted using constant temperature models and offers a compact descriptor communicating the growth capacity of variable thermal regimes. The method combines mathematical simplicity with translatability to different Q10 values without recourse to the underlining time series data.

Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing thermal safety margins'.

Their fitness, measured by intrinsic growth rate and net reproductive rate, is partially driven by biochemical processes. Thus, it is a function of ambient temperature. Biochemical processes may not be approximated well by yearly mean temperature alone when temperature cycles yearly, largely. Higher order moments may also be important. The amplitude of yearly fluctuations of monthly and seasonal sea temperatures varies dramatically across the northern temperate regions. Thus, they can impact the fitness, thereby the colonization potential of copepods migrating across such region. To investigate this, we derive approximate metrics of periodic (yearly) fitness: the yearly intrinsic growth rate, and a weighted net reproductive rate. We use them to measure the persistence and the growth of an Allee-effect free, stage-structured, fast-maturing, small population of invasive copepods that reproduces year-round in habitats with yearly temperature cycles. We show that the yearly fitness increases substantially when a population is introduced from a habitat with large amplitude to that with small amplitude yearly fluctuating temperatures, given that their mean temperatures and other environmental and ecological factors are constant. The detected range-expansion of the modeled species matches the potential fitness gradient predicted by the metrics. The study leads to the question whether the gradient of the amplitudes of temperature between habitats with similar yearly mean temperatures impacts a class of fast-maturating calanoid copepods, colonizing new habitats, and becoming invasive.",0022-5193,Temperature Cycles Affect Colonization Potential of Calanoid Copepods.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

It is therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age at 20 degrees C. We call this concept ""Equivalent Development"", as it maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given temperature to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the laboratory, we used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate development rate of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant temperatures. Using these estimates of development rate, we created a thermal performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development (TPCED). We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of embryos in several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that 85% of the variation of development stage in natural nests could be explained. Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model based on the TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model, where development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and the amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating temperature.",0306-4565,a New Method of Estimating Thermal Performance of Embryonic Development Rate Yields Accurate Prediction of Embryonic Age in Wild Reptile Nests.,selected,background,selected,y,,,,

Equally, all protagonists agree that thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in development.

We quantified how increases in the mean and variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO2 assimilation rates, A(net); its variability; and time under near-optimal photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this aim, the probability distribution of A(net) was obtained by combining a probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in T-l with data on A(net) responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and 111 species, including both C3 and C4 species.

To consider the combined effect of both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species population responses to inter-and intra-annual temperature changes. This framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions: Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain), and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing current and future (mid-21st century) climatic conditions under two emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in population size. High variability in population size was observed between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40 degrees during the next 50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose a modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and agricultural ecosystems.",1051-0761,Projecting Pest Population Dynamics under Global Warming: The Combined Effect of Inter- And Intra-Annual Variations.,selected,background modelling,selected,y,,,,

In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios.",0962-8452,Interactions among Thermal Parameters Determine Offspring Sex under Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination.,selected,background?,selected,y,,,,

Methods are needed to predict how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates. Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental variance remains constant, omitting it from population models compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global change under future environmental variability.",1461-023X,Environmental Variation and Population Responses to Global Change.,selected,BIG background,selected,y,,,,

We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the ""vertical shift or faster-slower"" hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance.

The aim of this research was to study the impact of three daily variable thermal environments (with maximum experimental temperatures between 10:00 and 16:00 hours), on the survival, developmental time and body size of metamorphs of four tropical anuran species from lowland habitats in Colombia. A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5(circle)C; maximum temperature = 34 +/- 1(circle)C; range = 23-35(circle)C), medium temperature (25.5(circle)C; 29 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-30(circle)C), and low temperature (24(circle)C; 24 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-25(circle)C).

For all species, the thermal variable environment with the highest temperature showed the greatest accumulated survival, reduced significantly the developmental time from embryos to metamorphs, and the snout-vent-length of metamorphs. Therefore, under field conditions where ponds are exposed to thermally variable environments, the highest temperatures may promote a decrease in the period of time to metamorphosis, and a positive increase for the anuran survival; nevertheless, extreme temperatures were also found in the microhabitat of the species studied, higher than their upper thermal limits reported, which suggest a vulnerable situation for them and other tropical anurans from similar habitats.",0034-7744,Impact of Daily Variable Temperatures in Life-History Traits of Tropical Anurans.,selected,extractable,selected,y,y ,table 1,organismal ,not sure if this is considered a journal in english but the manuscript is

We hypothesized that temperature should differentially affect early incubation stages, in which differentiation dominates over growth, and late incubation stages, characterized by high growth rates. To test this idea, we incubated eggs of wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) under three regimes with the same mean temperature (29 degrees C), one constant and two variable with opposite sequences: first cold (25 degrees C) and then hot (32 degrees C), and vice versa. Hatchlings incubated at high temperature during the initial period had shorter hindlimbs and tails than those incubated under the other two temperature regimes and shorter heads than those incubated initially at low temperature. Thus, temperature experienced by embryos during the early external incubation period produced similar phenotypic responses compared to those reported in previous studies for the same constant temperature applied over the whole incubation period. Because female wall lizards select lower body temperatures during pregnancy, an increase of intrauterine retention would extend the time of exposure of developing embryos to suitable temperatures. Diminution of body temperature during pregnancy is contrary to the expected pattern under the hypothesis that egg retention has evolved to accelerate development, as proposed by the cold-climate model for evolution of viviparity in squamates, and the results of the present study support the alternative hypothesis of developmental optimization as a special case of the broader maternal manipulation view.",0024-4066,The Selective Basis for Increased Egg Retention: Early Incubation Temperature Determines Hatchling Phenotype in Wall Lizards (Podarcis Muralis),selected,extractable,selected,y,y ,"figure 1,2",organismal ,

The beneficial effects of FTR result from physiological repair during warming intervals. The duration and the temperature experienced during the recovery period are supposed to strongly impact the resulting cold survival; however, disentangling the effects of both recovery variables had not been broadly investigated. In this study, we investigate cold tolerance (lethal time, Lt(50)) of the polyphagous beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. We examined adult survival under various CLTs (0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C), and under 20 different FTR conditions, where the 0 degrees C exposure alternated with various recovery temperatures (Rt) (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) combined with various recovery durations (Rds) (0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h). Under CLTs, Lt(50) increased with temperature until no mortality occurred above the upper limit of cold injury zone (ULCIZ). Under FTRs, Lt(50) increased with both Rt and Rd. The magnitude of the survival gain was clearly boosted when Rt was above the ULCIZ (at 20 degrees C). Based on a data matrix of lethal times with multiple Rt x Rd combinations, a predictive model showed that cold survival increased exponentially with Rt and Rd. This model was subsequently validated with additional survival tests. We suggest that increasing recovery durations associated with optimal recovery temperatures eventually leads to a progressive chilling compensation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Average temperature is the more common climatic variable used in physiological and population studies, and its effect on individual and population-level processes is well understood. However, the intrinsic variability of thermal conditions calls attention to the potential effects that this variability could have in ecological systems. Regarding this point, two hypotheses are proposed. From the allocation principle, it may be inferred that if temperature variability is high enough to induce stress in the organisms, then this extra-cost should reduce the energetic budget for reproduction, which will be reflected in population parameters. Moreover, a mathematical property of non-linear functions, Jensen's inequality, indicates that, in concave functions, like the temperature-reproduction performance function, variability reduces the expected value of the output variable, and again modifies population parameters. To test these hypotheses, experimental cultures of Tribolium confusum under two different thermal variability regimens were carried out. With these data, we fitted a simple population dynamics model to evaluate the predictions of our hypothesis. The results show that thermal variability reduces the maximum reproductive rate of the population but no other parameters such as carrying capacity or the nonlinear factor in a nonlinear version of the Ricker model, which confirms our hypotheses. This result has important consequences, such as the paradoxical increase in population variability under a decrease in thermal variability and the necessary incorporation of climatic variability to evaluate the net effect of climate change on the dynamics of natural populations.",1438-3896,Beyond Average: An Experimental Test of Temperature Variability on the Population Dynamics of Tribolium Confusum.,selected,extractable,selected,y,y ,table 1,organismal ,

We used a multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant 28 degrees C vs. 28 +/- 5 degrees C daily cycle) and food availability (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment. Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and food availability.

In the latter, the cold stress period was interrupted daily by 2 h pulses at 20 degrees C. Since acclimation enhances cold tolerance, we tested whether benefits of acclimation can combine with those of FTRs. Since D. melanogaster overwinters as non-reproductive adults, we tested if actively reproducing adults are more susceptible to cold stress than virgin females that have a much reduced reproductive activity. The results show that short interruptions of cold stress enhanced survival of adult flies. Survival was time- and temperature-dependent. Prior acclimation to low temperature allowed flies to better cope with cold stress under CLTs. On the other hand, acclimated flies did not profit from the benefits of FTRs and even showed lower survival under FTRs, probably because flies deacclimated during the periodic warm intervals. Gravid females were overall less cold tolerant than virgin females, and both survived better under FTRs.

We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C).

Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the upregulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18 degrees C, constant 28 degrees C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28 degrees C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax.

These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits.

Viability in two constant environments (25 degrees C or 30 degrees C) was used to estimate breeding values for environmental robustness of viability (i.e., reaction norm slope) and overall viability (reaction norm elevation). These breeding values were regressed against breeding values of viability at two different fluctuating temperatures (with a mean of 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C).

We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably fluctuating environment.

We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C), or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime, suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments. At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and, consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects.

Under natural conditions, Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) eggs are influenced by thermal changes in the interior of the nest related to the external environmental temperature. As nests are subject to variations in temperature and most lab studies on crocodilian incubation have been carried out at constant temperatures, we were interested in determining how temperature fluctuations may affect the development of caiman embryos. We investigated the effects of incubation at constant temperatures (31 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 33 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (31 +/- 2, 32 +/- 1, and 32 +/- 2 degrees C) on the following aspects: incubation period duration, hatching success, sex ratio, total length, and body mass of C. latirostris hatchlings. Eggs incubated at 31 degrees C produced 100% females, those at 32 degrees C produced 71.6% females (however, the sex ratio was nest related), and at 33 degrees C produced 100% males. We found a masculinizing effect when incubation was at 31 +/- 2 degrees C compared with a constant 31 degrees C; and temperature fluctuations at 32 degrees C (32 +/- 1 and 32 +/- 2 degrees C) had a negative effect on hatchlings size and mass, and hatching success compared with constant incubation temperatures of 32 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Finally, the effect of temperature variation during the incubation period on sex ratio, hatching success, and phenotype depends on the mean temperature, as the fluctuation around 31 degrees C affected the sex ratios and incubation period, and the fluctuation around 32 degrees C affected hatchling success and size.",2471-5638,"Influence of Temperature Variation on Incubation Period, Hatching Success, Sex Ratio, and Phenotypes in Caiman Latirostris.",selected,extractable,selected,y,y ,table 1,organismal ,

Parasitized fifth-instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were reared individually in incubators at six fluctuating temperature regimes (15-19.5 degrees C with a mean of 17.6 degrees C, 17.5-22.5 degrees C with a mean of 19.8 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C with a mean of 22.7 degrees C, 22.5-27.5 degrees C with a mean of 25 degrees C, 25.5-32.5 degrees C with a mean of 28.3 degrees C and 28.5-33 degrees C with a mean of 30 degrees C) until emergence and death of V. canescens adults. Developmental time from parasitism to adult eclosion, adult longevity and survival were recorded at each fluctuating temperature regime. In principle, developmental time decreased with an increase of the mean temperature of the fluctuating temperature regime. Upper and lower threshold temperatures for total development were estimated at 34.9 and 6.7 degrees C, respectively. Optimum temperature for development and thermal constant were 28.6 degrees C and 526.3 degree days, respectively. Adult longevity was also affected by fluctuating temperature, as it was significantly reduced at the highest mean temperature (7.0 days at 30 degrees C) compared to the lowest one (29.4 days at 17.6 degrees C). Survival was low at all tested fluctuating temperatures, apart from mean fluctuating temperature of 25 degrees C (37%).

However, the specific effect of day and night temperature on flower initiation has not been well described, and the reported requirement for a diurnal temperature fluctuation to elicit flowering is unclear. Two Phalaenopsis clones were grown in glass greenhouse compartments with constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, or 29 degrees C and fluctuating day/night (12 h/12 h) temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/17, or 29/23 degrees C.

These results indicate that a day/night fluctuation in temperature is not required for inflorescence initiation in these two Phalaenopsis clones.

Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible.

To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over functional traits.

Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a split-brood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity.

The lowest mean CTmin value recorded here was -3.56 +/- 1.0 degrees C for Paristoma notabilis and the highest mean CTmax was 43.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C for Hemisotoma thermophila.

While incubation experiments unambiguously show that constant high temperature accelerates development and shortens embryonic life, studies on the effect of fluctuating temperatures have generated contradictory results. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) occur at latitudes and altitudes that are unusually cool for an oviparous reptile. In these cool climates females typically lay their eggs in heat-generating anthropogenic microhabitats that provide either a highly fluctuating (compost piles) or a relatively constant (manure heaps) thermal nesting environment. A laboratory experiment with fluctuating and constant incubation temperatures mimicking those recorded in such nests in the field showed that this nest-site dichotomy influences the development of the embryos, and the morphology and locomotor performance of the hatchlings. The incubation period increased at fluctuating temperatures and the fact that the rate of embryonic development showed a decelerating pattern with temperature suggests that periods of low temperature had a relatively larger influence on average development than periods of high temperature. Our study demonstrates how a dichotomy in the nesting environments available to female grass snakes in cool climates can affect variation in the duration of the incubation period and offspring phenotypes in ways that may have consequences for fitness.

Declining incubation temperatures might provide such a cue for montane lizards, because eggs that fail to hatch before winter will perish in the nest. I tested this idea by incubating eggs of an alpine scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi) in the laboratory. For the first half of the incubation period the eggs were kept at nest temperatures typical of those experienced in summer in the field (daily cycle of 18+/-7.5degreesC). I then transferred eggs at weekly intervals into cooler regimes (either 15+/-7.5degreesC; or with daytime temperatures unchanged but dropping to 0degreesC overnight). Contrary to prediction, the eggs did not hatch early. However, transfer to lower temperatures caused only a relatively short delay in hatching, because of a virtual temperature-independence of developmental rates late (but not early) in incubation. Decreasing incubation temperatures also modified hatchling running speeds and post-hatching growth rates, even if the thermal decrease occurred only shortly before the usual time of hatching. These processes plausibly affect hatchling fitness in cold-climate reptiles, and might be adaptations to montane habitats. Alternatively, they may prove to be widespread in other (warmer-climate) reptile taxa, in which case no adaptive hypothesis need be proposed.

We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored. Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated temperatures alone.

Periodically increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) were exposed to a constant temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily fluctuation to 20 degrees C. RNA was collected at two different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels. Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.",0022-0949,Transcriptional Responses to Fluctuating Thermal Regimes Underpinning Differences in Survival in the Solitary Bee Megachile Rotundata.,selected,extractable?,selected,y ,n ,,,transcriptome differences?

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5 degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3 degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and overwinter survival.",0022-0949,Temperature Experienced During Incubation Affects Antioxidant Capacity but not Oxidative Damage in Hatchling Red-Eared Slider Turtles (Trachemys Scripta Elegans),selected,extractable?,selected,y ,y ,figure 1,organismal ,incubation in flux temps

While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions.

To facilitate its biocontrol with strategies such as sterile or incompatible insect techniques, D. suzukii must be mass-produced and then stored and transported under low temperature. Prolonged cold exposure induces chill injuries that can be mitigated if the cold period is interrupted with short warming intervals, referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes (FTR). In this study, we tested how to optimally use FTR to extend the shelf life of D. suzukii under cold storage. Several FTR parameters were assessed: temperature (15, 20, 25 degrees C), duration (0.5, 1, 2, 3 h), and frequency (every 12, 24, 36, 48 h) of warming intervals, in two wild-type lines and in two developmental stages (pupae and adults). Generally, FTR improved cold storage tolerance with respect to constant low temperatures (CLT). Cold mortality was lower when recovery temperature was 20 degrees C or higher, when duration was 2 h per day or longer, and when warming interruptions occurred frequently (every 12 or 24 h). Applying an optimized FTR protocol to adults greatly reduced cold mortality over long-term storage (up to 130 d). Consequences of FTR on fitness-related traits were also investigated. For adults, poststorage survival was unaffected by FTR, as was the case for female fecundity and male mating capacity. On the other hand, when cold storage occurred at pupal stage, poststorage survival and male mating capacity were altered under CLT, but not under FTR. After storage of pupae, female fecundity was lower under FTR compared to CLT, suggesting an energy trade-off between repair of chill damages and egg production. This study provides detailed information on the application and optimization of an FTR-based protocol for cold storage of D. suzukii that could be useful for the biocontrol of this pest.",1672-9609,Effects of Fluctuating Thermal Regimes on Cold Survival and Life History Traits of the Spotted Wing Drosophila (Drosophila Suzukii),selected,maybe extractable?,selected,y ,y ,figure 1,organismal ,"extraction  could be tricky, not sure where sample sizes are "

We determined the cold tolerance strategy, low temperature thermal limits, and plasticity of cold tolerance in both male and female adult D. suzukii. We reared flies under common conditions (long days, 21 degrees C; control) and induced plasticity by rapid cold-hardening (RCH, 1 h at 0 degrees C followed by 1 h recovery), cold acclimation (CA, 5 days at 6 degrees C) or acclimation under fluctuating temperatures (FA). D. suzukii had supercooling points (SCPs) between -16 and -23 degrees C, and were chill-susceptible. 80% of control flies were killed after 1 h at -7.2 degrees C (males) or -7.5 degrees C (females); CA and FA improved survival of this temperature in both sexes, but RCH did not. 80% of control flies were killed after 70 h (male) or 92 h (female) at 0 degrees C, and FA shifted this to 112 h (males) and 165 h (females). FA flies entered chill coma (CTmin) at approximately -1.7 degrees C, which was ca. 0.5 degrees C colder than control flies; RCH and CA increased the CTmin compared to controls. Control and RCH flies exposed to 0 degrees C for 8 h took 30-40 min to recover movement, but this was reduced to <10 min in CA and FA. Flies placed outside in a field cage in London, Ontario, were all killed by a transient cold snap in December. We conclude that adult phenotypic plasticity is not sufficient to allow D. suzukii to overwinter in temperate habitats, and suggest that flies could overwinter in association with built structures, or that there may be additional cold tolerance imparted by developmental plasticity.

Studies on coral resistance mechanisms have proposed a correlation between shuffling of different Symbiodiniaceae genera (changing the dominant Symbiodiniaceae genera) and putative thermal tolerance in corals. Although it was suggested that some corals can increase their tolerance by 1.0-1.5 degrees C through shuffling to thermally tolerant Durusdinium trenchii (formerly D1a), the effects of accumulated thermal stress due to prolonged high temperatures on the survival of corals that have shuffled have not been investigated. We show herein that prolonged exposure to high temperature (> 10.43-degree heating weeks) can drastically reduce coral survival rate even after it has shuffled to stress-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae genera.

When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.",0022-0949,Temperature and Uv-b-Insensitive Performance in Tadpoles of the Ornate Burrowing Frog: An Ephemeral Pond Specialist.,selected,maybe extractable?,selected,y,y ,"figure 2, 4, 5",organismal ,

In addition, survival of 3rd and 5th instar larvae and pupae increased under the conditions of thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) and thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) + RCH, possibly due to the induction of heat shock proteins or cryoprotectants. However, the pre-treatments of thermoperiod + RCH + RHH and thermoperiod + RHH + RCH did not significantly enhance survival of any developmental stage.

Such structures typically are irreversible for at least some stage in the organism's life. In this study we investigated whether recurrent and reversible adaptation to changes in the thermal environment incurs a cost in terms of some key life-history traits in the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We exposed juvenile O. cincta to two treatments differing in the frequency of temperature fluctuation but with equal total temperature sums. In the high frequency treatment temperature fluctuated daily between 10 and 20 degrees C, while in the low frequency treatment temperature fluctuated on a weekly schedule. During the treatments we measured juvenile growth rate and juvenile mortality, and after six weeks the animals were transferred to constant 15 degrees C and adult starvation resistance was assessed. We found no significant differences between the treatments in juvenile growth rate or juvenile survival. Also, adults that had grown up under high frequency temperature fluctuations did not suffer from reduced starvation resistance compared to animals growing under low frequency temperature fluctuations. This finding supports the hypothesis that selection minimizes the production costs of inducible phenotypes and suggests that the development of optimal phenotypes and evolution of temperature reaction norms are not constrained by such costs.

Despite growing consensus that anthropogenic climate change will increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of extreme events, current understanding of their impact on communities and ecosystems is limited. Here, we used sessile invertebrates on settlement panels as model assemblages to examine the influence of HW magnitude, duration and timing on marine biodiversity patterns. Settlement panels were deployed in a marina in southwest UK for >= 5 weeks, to allow sufficient time for colonisation and development of sessile fauna, before being subjected to simulated HWs in a mesocosm facility. Replicate panel assemblages were held at ambient sea temperature (similar to 17 degrees C), or +3 degrees C or +5 degrees C for a period of 1 or 2 weeks, before being returned to the marina for a recovery phase of 2-3 weeks. The 10-week experiment was repeated 3 times, staggered throughout summer, to examine the influence of HW timing on community impacts.

With the exception of 1 high-magnitude long-durationHWevent, warming did not alter not assemblage structure, favour non-native species, nor lead to changes in richness, abundance or biomass of sessile faunal assemblages. The observed lack of effect may have been caused by a combination of (1) the use of relatively low magnitude, realistic heat wave treatments compared to previous studies (2), the greater resilience of mature adult sessile fauna compared to recruits and juveniles, and (3) the high thermal tolerance of the model organisms (i.e., temperate fouling species, principally bryozoans and ascidians).

Organisms exposed to high temperature stresses typically protect themselves with a heat shock response (HSR), where accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the synthesis of heat shock proteins through the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. While the molecular mechanisms are qualitatively well characterized, our quantitative understanding of the underlying dynamics is still very limited. Here, we study the dynamics of HSR in the photosynthetic model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a data-driven mathematical model of HSR. We based our dynamical model mostly on mass action kinetics, with a few nonlinear terms. The model was parametrized and validated by several independent datasets obtained from the literature. We demonstrate that HSR quantitatively and significantly differs if an increase in temperature of the same magnitude occurs abruptly, as often applied under laboratory conditions, or gradually, which would rather be expected under natural conditions. In contrast to rapid temperature increases, under gradual changes only negligible amounts of misfolded proteins accumulate, indicating that the HSR of C. reinhardtii efficiently avoids the accumulation of misfolded proteins under conditions most likely to prevail in nature.

First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures.

The model allows exploration of temperature-driven temporal changes in adult age structure, giving insights into the population's capacity to vector malaria parasites. Because of temperature-dependent shifts in age structure, the abundance of potentially infectious mosquitoes varies temporally, and does not necessarily mirror the dynamics of the total adult population. In addition to conducting the first comprehensive theoretical exploration of fluctuating temperatures on mosquito population dynamics, we analysed observed temperatures at four locations in Africa covering a range of environmental conditions. We found both temperature and precipitation are needed to explain the observed malaria season in these locations, enhancing our understanding of the drivers of malaria seasonality and how temporal disease risk may shift in response to temperature changes.

Using experimental lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel climates. Results We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however, associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions, resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast, lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions We propose that thermal adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.",1471-2148,Maladaptive Plasticity Facilitates Evolution of Thermal Tolerance During an Experimental Range Shift.,selected,modelling background,selected,y,,,,

We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that TPCs are fixed during ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-specific ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change.

If heat waves increase in frequency and duration as predicted, it is necessary to understand how these bouts could affect thermally sensitive species, including reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). In a multi-year study using fluctuating temperatures, we exposedTrachemys scriptaembryos to cooler, male-producing temperatures interspersed with warmer, female-producing temperatures (heat waves) that varied in either timing during development or continuity and then analysed resulting sex ratios. We also quantified the expression of genes involved in testis differentiation (Dmrt1) and ovary differentiation (Cyp19A1) to determine how heat wave continuity affects the expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation. Heat waves applied during the middle of development produced significantly more females compared to heat waves that occurred just 7 days before or after this window, and even short gaps in the continuity of a heat wave decreased the production of females. Continuous heat exposure resulted in increasedCyp19A1expression while discontinuous heat exposure failed to increase expression in either gene over a similar time course. We report that even small differences in the timing and continuity of heat waves can result in drastically different phenotypic outcomes. This strong effect of temperature occurred despite the fact that embryos were exposed to the same number of warm days during a short period of time, which highlights the need to study temperature effects under more ecologically relevant conditions where temperatures may be elevated for only a few days at a time.

As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed, physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N. rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10 degrees C all year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical responses during cold exposure (3 degrees C). These seven populations showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be established between the amplitude of thermal variations and cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in subterranean crustaceans than in other arthropods.",0022-0949,Do Current Environmental Conditions Explain Physiological and Metabolic Responses of Subterranean Crustaceans to Cold?,selected,observational,selected,y ,,,,

We conducted a study in a thermal effluent canal on Lake Eric to examine the influence of fluctuating thermal regimes on parental care and reproductive success of smallmouth bass.

While many laboratory studies have been conducted on primate thermoregulation, we know comparatively little about the thermal pressures primates face in their natural, evolutionarily relevant environment. Such knowledge is critical to understanding the evolution of thermal adaptations in primates and for comparative evaluation of humans' unique thermal adaptations. We examined temperature and thermal environment in free-ranging, mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in a tropical dry forest in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We recorded subcutaneous (T-sc) and near-animal ambient temperatures (T-a) from 11 animals over 1586.5 sample hours during wet and dry seasons. Howlers displayed considerable variation in T-sc, which was largely attributable to circadian effects. Despite significant seasonal changes in the ambient thermal environment, howlers showed relatively little evidence for seasonal changes in T-sc. Howlers experienced warm thermal conditions which led to body cooling relative to the environment, and plateaus in T-sc at increasingly warm T-a. They also frequently faced cool thermal conditions (T-a < T-sc) in which T-sc was markedly elevated compared with T-a. These data add to a growing body of evidence that non-human primates have more labile body temperatures than humans.

Snakes in these populations differed in growth rate and adult body size, and these differences may be related to the influence of thermal environment on energetics. During summer months, operative environmental temperatures at BOQ were hotter than at GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures resulted in approximate to 64% less time available for diurnal surface use (e.g., foraging) at BOQ relative to GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures also constrained the average T-b of BOQ snakes at night to be from 2 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C hotter than GVH snakes during July and August. Despite hotter T-b, estimated resting metabolic expenditures of BOQ snakes during July and August were similar to estimated expenditures of GVH snakes because BOQ snakes had lower mass-specific metabolic rates.

Mean hourly nest temperature, as well as mean minimum and mean maximum nest temperature, differed significantly between southern ground-hornbill nests in both breeding seasons. Mean nest temperature also differed significantly from mean ambient temperature for both seasons. Natural nest cavities provided a buffer against the ambient temperature fluctuations. The artificial nest provided little insulation against temperature extremes, being warmer and cooler than the maximum and minimum local ambient temperatures, respectively. Nest cavity temperature was not found to have an influence on the breeding success of the southern ground-hornbill groups investigated in this study.

A model of the temperature variations of the pool, based on diffusional exchange with the sea at high tide and with the air at low tide, shows good agreement with the experimental results. Fourier transform analysis of the variations of the main components of the frequency spectrum during a lunar cycle and for different values of the parameters (temperature variations of the air, level ofthe pool relative to the tide, exchange coefficients with the air and the ocean) reveals a complex structure. When the tidal component exists, it is stable in power and frequency, but is, in most cases, much smaller than the diel peak. Baning the situations when the tide does not reach the pool for several days, the period of the pool is equal to 24.8 h (the first subharmonic ofthe tidal frequency), except for the part ofthe lunar cycle during which the high tide corresponds approximately to the extrema of air temperature: Then the period is lower than 24 h and the power decreases. Overall, the mean period is 24 h, which is coherent with the fact that the driving force ofthe temperature variations is the sun, while its input in the pool is modulated by the tide. The same results can be applied, with a lesser amplitude ofthe temperature variations, to larger bodies ofwater. From these results, it is difficult to decide whether the temperature variations constitute a zeitgeber for circadian or circatidal clocks. The present conclusion is that this parameter seems to be, at best, a very unreliable synchronizer.",0742-0528,Is the Variation of the Temperature in an Intertidal Pool Diel or Tidal - a Paradigm for Studying Biological Rhythms in the Tidal Zone.,selected,observational background,selected,y ,,,,

As ocean warming continues, performance of marine species will be impacted. Many studies have focused on how warming will impact physiology, life history, and behavior, but few studies have investigated how ecological and behavioral traits of organisms will affect their response to changing thermal environments. Here, we assessed the thermal tolerances and thermal sensitivity of swimming performance of two sympatric mysid shrimp species of the Northwest Atlantic. Neomysis americana and Heteromysis formosa overlap in habitat and many aspects of their ecological niche, but only N. americana exhibits vertical migration. In temperate coastal ecosystems, temperature stratification of the water column exposes vertical migrators to a wider range of temperatures on a daily basis. We found that N. americana had a significantly lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, both mysid species had a buffer of at least 4 degrees C between their CTmax and the 100-year projection for mean summer water temperatures of 28 degrees C. Swimming performance of the vertically migrating species was more sensitive to temperature variation, and this species exhibited faster burst swimming speeds. The generalist performance curve of H. formosa and specialist curve of N. americana are consistent with predictions based on the exposure of each species to temperature variation such that higher within-generation variability promotes specialization. However, these species violate the assumption of the specialist-generalist tradeoff in that the area under their performance curves is not constant.

These patterns can manifest along a coastline as well as across the continental shelf due to ecological interactions and environmental gradients. Several abiotic surrogates for environmental variables are hypothesised to structure high-latitude coral communities in South Africa along and across its narrow shelf and were investigated using a correlative approach that considered spatial autocorrelation. Surveys of sessile communities were conducted on 17 reefs and related to depth, distance to high tide, distance to the continental shelf edge and to submarine canyons. All four environmental variables were found to correlate significantly with community composition, even after the effects of space were removed. The environmental variables accounted for 13% of the variation in communities; 77% of this variation was spatially structured. Spatially structured environmental variation unrelated to the environmental variables accounted for 39% of the community variation. The Northern Reef Complex appears to be less affected by oceanic factors and may undergo less temperature variability than the Central and Southern Complexes; the first is mentioned because it had the lowest canyon effect and was furthest from the continental shelf, whilst the latter complexes had the highest canyon effects and were closest to the shelf edge. These characteristics may be responsible for the spatial differences in the coral communities.",NA,Environmental Variation and How Its Spatial Structure Influences the Cross-Shelf Distribution of High-Latitude Coral Communities in South Africa.,selected,observational background,selected,y ,,,,

In marine ecosystems, the importance of marine heatwaves (MHWs) - discrete periods of anomalously high sea temperatures - is gaining recognition. In 2011, the highest-magnitude MHW ever recorded impacted the west coast of Australia (southeast Indian Ocean). The MHW was associated with widespread mortality of habitat-forming species, including corals and kelps, and structural changes in assemblages of macroalgae and fish. However, the responses of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages have not yet been fully documented. Here, we resurveyed 2 subtidal habitat types (reef 'flats' and 'slopes') at 4 locations (spanning > 800 km of coastline and > 6 degrees of latitude) during the period 1999-2015 to examine the effects of the 2011 MHW on herbivorous macroinvertebrates (i. e. sea urchins, gastropod molluscs). Responses to the MHW varied with latitude; at our warmest study location, abundances were severely depleted, whereas no effects were detected at the coolest location. Across the entire study region, subtle but significant shifts in assemblage structure were observed due to decreased abundances of more southerly-distributed species (i. e. 'cool' affinity) and increased abundances of several more northerly-distributed species (i. e. 'warm' affinity). The 2011 MHW has had profound effects on the marine biota off the west coast of Australia, across multiple trophic levels and taxonomic groups.

The animals were then examined under three equal 4-day periods: ad libitum feeding, fasting and re-feeding. Through the analysis of daily as well as short-term, or ultradian, variations of body temperature, we showed that while ducklings at TN show only a modest decline in daily thermoregulatory parameters when fasted, they exhibit reduced surface temperatures from key sites of vascular heat exchange during fasting. The CA birds, on the other hand, significantly reduced their short-term variations of body temperature while increasing long-term variability when fasting. This phenomenon would allow the CA birds to reduce the energetic cost of body temperature maintenance under fasting. By analysing ultradian regulation of body temperature, we describe a means by which an endotherm appears to lower thermoregulatory costs in response to the combined stressors of cold and fasting.",0962-8452,Novel Energy-Saving Strategies to Multiple Stressors in Birds: The Ultradian Regulation of Body Temperature.,selected,observational background,selected,y ,,,,

However, can being too plastic actually be detrimental? Malagasy common tenrecs, Tenrec ecaudatus, have many plesiomorphic traits and may represent a basal placental mammal. We established a laboratory population of T. ecaudatus and found extreme plasticity in thermoregulation and metabolism, a novel hibernation form, variable annual timing, and remarkable growth and reproductive biology. For instance, tenrec body temperature (T-b) may approximate ambient temperature to as low as 12 degrees C even when tenrecs are fully active. Conversely, tenrecs can hibernate with Tb of 28 degrees C. During the active season, oxygen consumption may vary 25-fold with little or no change in T-b. During the austral winter, tenrecs are consistently torpid but the depth of torpor may vary. A righting assay revealed that T-b contributes to but does not dictate activity status. Homeostatic processes are not always linked, e.g. a hibernating tenrec experienced a similar to 34% decrease in heart rate while maintaining constant body temperature and oxygen consumption rates. Tenrec growth rates vary but young may grow similar to 40-fold in the 5 weeks until weaning and may possess indeterminate growth as adults. Despite all of this profound plasticity, tenrecs are surprisingly intolerant of extremes in ambient temperature (<8 or >34 degrees C).

Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily pulse of 20 degrees C for 7 days. RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes, oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state of M. rotundata.

Our 2-y census of the expression of a temperature-dependent flowering-time gene, AhgFLC, in a natural population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri revealed that the regulatory system of this flowering-time gene extracts seasonal cues as if it memorizes temperatures over the past 6 wk. Time-series analysis revealed that as much as 83% of the variation in the AhgFLC expression is explained solely by the temperature for the previous 6 wk, but not by the temperatures over shorter or longer periods.

Diet, frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore snakes, respectively.

Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations.

However, few experiments have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six populations that spanned the species' geographic range in the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have differentiated across the species' range. There was some evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly variable responses to transplantation across the species' range, and only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate change that have not been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing angiosperms.",0002-9122,Population Differentiation and Countergradient Variation Throughout the Geographic Range in the Fern Gametophyte Vittaria Appalachiana.,selected,unclear,selected,y ,n ,,organismal,measuring geographical differences in temp from different locations

This has an increasing influence on crop plants. However, little is known about the physiology of high night temperature (HNT) effects and natural variation in HNT susceptibility. Twelve rice cultivars were investigated under HNT (30 degrees C day/28 degrees C night) and control (28 degrees C day/21 degrees C night) conditions. Chlorosis was observed under HNT and used to classify relative sensitivity of cultivars. The resulting mean sensitivity rank correlated significantly with seed yield under HNT (r = -0.547). Wide variability in HNT tolerance led to an increase in shoot FW and DW in tolerant, but decreased plant growth in sensitive cultivars. Growth parameters correlated negatively with HNT sensitivity. Respiration rate was significantly increased under HNT at the end of night for several cultivars 34 DAS and 41 DAS and for all cultivars 66 DAS whereas photosynthetic quantum yield was not influenced. Negative correlations of sensitivity rank with respiration rate at two time points under HNT (r = -0.305; r = -0.265) exclude higher respiration rates in sensitive cultivars as a primary cause for HNT sensitivity. Monosaccharide and starch concentrations of leaves were increased after 16 days of HNT, while sucrose was not affected. Additionally tolerant cultivars showed a higher increase of monosaccharide concentrations during the day under HNT compared with control conditions. While HNT did not lead to carbon depletion in rice leaves, tolerant cultivars coped better with HNT, enabling them to accumulate more carbohydrates than sensitive cultivars with leaves affected by chlorosis.",1445-4408,Differential Physiological Responses of Different Rice (Oryza Sativa) Cultivars to Elevated Night Temperature During Vegetative Growth.,selected,unclear,selected,y ,n ,,organismal,no constant treatment

However, many abiotic environmental stresses, including temperature, fluctuate within an organism's lifespan. Given that organisms may trade-off survival at the cost of future reproduction, we investigated the effects of multiple cold exposures on survival and fertility in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We found that multiple cold exposures significantly decreased mortality compared with the same length of exposure in a single sustained bout, but significantly decreased fecundity (as measured by r, the intrinsic rate of increase) as well, owing to a shift in sex ratio. This change was reflected in a long-term decrease in glycogen stores in multiply exposed flies, while a brief effect on triglyceride stores was observed, suggesting flies are reallocating energy stores. Given that many environments are not static, this trade-off indicates that investigating the effects of repeated stress exposure is important for understanding and predicting physiological responses in the wild.",0962-8452,Repeated Stress Exposure Results in a Survival-Reproduction Trade-Off in Drosophila Melanogaster.,selected,unclear,selected,y ,n ,,organismal,"multiple cold exposures, pulse press?"

We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals, PPFD, R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations, appear to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent species diversity.

Accordingly, the chemical compounds present in the material wasps use to build their nests can both facilitate communication and repel predators. It is herein hypothesized that different wasp species build their nests with different structure and substrate materials and that such materials consist of chemical compounds related to unique wasp behavior and outside temperature variation. To test this hypothesis, nests were collected from three species of social wasps, the samples of which were subjected to temperature variation under laboratory conditions. The compounds present in the substrate were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Chemical compounds identified in the nest material of the three species responded differently to temperature variation. Chemical compounds from Polybia nests were altered significantly when subjected to temperature variation, whereas the nests of Polistes versicolor did not significantly change in relation to the control. The differences found between Polistes and Polybia nests may be related to genetic factors, but also to the type of nest they construct. It is possible that divergent evolutionary strategies for maintaining colony temperature, as a function of the chemical composition of the nests, may have appeared between wasps that have open and closed nests. In relatively small colonies, nest substrate is more resistant to temperature variation because it is composed of a greater diversity of elements and thus capable of holding heavier, longer carbon chains. Our results suggest that chemical compounds in the nest material of the three wasp species analysed responded differently to fluctuating ambient temperatures and that such variation could result from the biochemical differences of unique wasp species or from thermoregulation strategies of colonies.",0306-4565,Effect of Temperature on the Chemical Profiles of Nest Materials of Social Wasps.,selected,"unclear, unlikely to be extractable",selected,y ,n ,,,"how organic chemistry composition changes with temperature flux, not relevant "

Plasticity in Daphnia DVM behavior optimizes fitness via trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migration behavior is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light, predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difficult to determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically significant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations; (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia vertical migration; and (3) defining how two anthropogenic stressors (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior. Simulated natural lake stratification were constructed in 8 L (0.5 m tall, 14.5 cm wide) water columns to monitor under controlled laboratory conditions the individual effects of temperature gradients, depth, and metal stressors on Daphnia vertical migration. Three major findings are reported. First, while no difference in thermal preference was found among the four populations studied, within lake populations variability among isolates was high. Second, decoupling temperature and depth revealed that depth was a better predictor of Daphnia migratory patterns over temperature. Third, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper or nickel inhibited classic DVM behavior. These findings revealed the high variability in thermal preference found within Daphnia populations, elucidated the individual roles that depth and temperature have on migratory behavior, and showed how copper and nickel can interfere with the natural response of Daphnia to fish predator cues. Thus contributing to the body of knowledge necessary to predict how natural populations of Daphnia will be affected by climate related changes in lake temperatures and increased presence of anthropogenic stressors.
