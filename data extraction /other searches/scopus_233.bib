abstract={Adaptation and/or acclimatization through various mechanisms have been suggested to help some tropical coral species to overcome temperature-induced bleaching that is intensifying with climate change; however, while much research has been done on the physiological responses of tropical and subtropical corals to stress, little is known about these responses in corals in marginal environments—e.g., high-latitude and non-reefal communities. In this study, we examined the thermal-tolerant physiology of the flowerpot coral, Alveopora japonica, endemic to the high-latitude Jeju Island (33.39°N), South Korea and Oulastrea crispata and Coelastrea aspera from the subtropical non-reefal coral community on the Penghu Islands (23.34°N), Taiwan. Analysis of physiological parameters; photochemical efficiency, Chlorophyll pigment, Symbiodiniaceae cell number and host soluble proteins - showed that A. japonica can survive through a wide range of temperature stresses (10–32 °C) over a period of 8 days without showing signs of bleaching. In addition, corals O. crispata and C. aspera withstood temperature stresses of up to 33 °C and repeated temperature fluctuations without bleaching. Our results indicate that, under large seasonal variations and asymmetrical daily fluctuations in temperature, corals currently living in marginal environments could have thermal plasticity, allowing them to survive in the future climate change scenarios. This study reiterates the importance of studying the eco-physiology of corals that are generally ignored because of their neutral or positive responses to stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Evergreen conifers in boreal forests can survive extremely cold (freezing) temperatures during long dark winter and fully recover during summer. A phenomenon called “sustained quenching” putatively provides photoprotection and enables their survival, but its precise molecular and physiological mechanisms are not understood. To unveil them, here we have analyzed seasonal adjustment of the photosynthetic machinery of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees by monitoring multi-year changes in weather, chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplast ultrastructure, and changes in pigment-protein composition. Analysis of Photosystem II and Photosystem I performance parameters indicate that highly dynamic structural and functional seasonal rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus occur. Although several mechanisms might contribute to ‘sustained quenching’ of winter/early spring pine needles, time-resolved fluorescence analysis shows that extreme down-regulation of photosystem II activity along with direct energy transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I play a major role. This mechanism is enabled by extensive thylakoid destacking allowing for the mixing of PSII with PSI complexes. These two linked phenomena play crucial roles in winter acclimation and protection. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Climate change will increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves. This thermal volatility will challenge to the oxidative homeostasis of aquatic ectotherms through many temperature-dependent environmental factors. In this study, we examined the effects of chronic exposure of sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) to multiple thermal regimes on the oxidative physiology of white muscle in these eurytolerant fish. The thermal treatments included stable (15 °C and 30 °C) and cycling regimes (between 21 and 29 °C at 6, 8 and 10-h intervals). The effect of these thermal treatments on oxidative stress during an acute thermal challenge (12 h at 32 °C) was also examined. Enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), scavenging capacities of hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage were quantified. We found no differences between or across treatments in any of the enzymatic antioxidants or LPO damage. We found that peroxyl radical scavenging was greatest at the peak of the 8- and 10-h thermal cycles. Peroxyl scavenging after an acute thermal challenge was greater than before the challenge for the steady 15 °C and 8-h cycle treatments, greater before the acute challenge for the steady 30 °C and 6-h cycle, and equivalent in the 10-h cycle. These findings demonstrate that even the most tolerant of marine ectotherms must engage oxidative defenses when presented with thermal variability and heighten concerns about the impact of climate change on less tolerant species. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Movement provides a link between individual behavioral ecology and the spatial and temporal variation in an individual’s landscape. Individual variation in movement traits is an important axis of animal personality, particularly in the context of foraging ecology. We tested whether individual caribou (Rangifer tarandus) displayed plasticity in movement and space-use behavior across a gradient of resource aggregation. We quantified first-passage time and range-use ratio as proxies for movement-related foraging behavior and examined how these traits varied at the individual level across a foraging resource gradient. Our results suggest that individuals adjusted first-passage time but not range-use ratio to maximize access to high-quality foraging resources. First-passage time was repeatable, and intercepts for first-passage time and range-use ratio were negatively correlated. Individuals matched first-passage time but not range-use ratio to the expectations of our patch-use model that maximized access to foraging resources, a result that suggests that individuals acclimated their movement patterns to accommodate both intra-and interannual variation in foraging resources on the landscape. Collectively, we highlight repeatable movement and space-use tactics and provide insight into how individual plasticity in movement interacts with landscape processes to affect the distribution of behavioral phenotypes and potentially fitness and population dynamics. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Estimates of lower thermal limits are widely used to infer sensitivity to climate variability, local adaptation and adaptive acclimation responses in ectotherms. These inferences build on the ecological relevance of the tolerance estimates and assume that estimates can be extrapolated to relevant conditions. Methodological effects for upper thermal limits have been extensively investigated, with different ramping rates and acclimation regimes giving rise to varying, and even disparate, conclusions. However, methodological effects have received much less attention for lower thermal limits. In this study, we explicitly test whether methodology could affect estimates of lower thermal limits in interaction with acclimation temperature and thermal variability, by acclimating adult Drosophila melanogaster to different constant and fluctuating temperature regimes and generating reaction norms at different ramping rates. We find that ramping rates have no significant effect on the lower thermal limits. Constant temperature acclimation resulted in non-linear reaction norms, while the introduction of thermal variability during adult life result in linear reaction norms. Thus, applying ecologically relevant conditions (here thermal variability) potentially impacts the results and conclusions of insect low temperature tolerance and acclimation capacity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Stem water storage capacity and hydraulic capacitance (CS) play a crucial role in tree survival under drought-stress. To investigate whether CS adjusts to increasing water deficit, variation in stem water content (StWC) was monitored in vivo for 2 years and related to periodical measurements of tree water potential in Mediterranean Quercus ilex trees subjected either to permanent throughfall exclusion (TE) or to control conditions. Seasonal reductions in StWC were larger in TE trees relative to control ones, resulting in greater seasonal CS (154 and 80 kg m−3 MPa−1, respectively), but only during the first phase of the desorption curve, when predawn water potential was above −1.1 MPa. Below this point, CS decreased substantially and did not differ between treatments (&lt;20 kg m−3 MPa−1). The allometric relationship between tree diameter and sapwood area, measured via electrical resistivity tomography, was not affected by TE. Our results suggest that (a) CS response to water deficit in the drought-tolerant Q. ilex might be more important to optimize carbon gain during well-hydrated periods than to prevent drought-induced embolism formation during severe drought stress, and (b) enhanced CS during early summer does not result from proportional increases in sapwood volume, but mostly from increased elastic water. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Variable, changing climates may affect each participant in a biotic interaction differently. We explored the effects of temperature and plasticity on the outcome of a host-pathogen interaction to try to predict the outcomes of infection under fluctuating temperatures. We infected Gryllus veletis crickets with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum under constant (67, 127, 187, or 257C) or fluctuating (from 67 to 187C or from 67 to 257C) temperatures. We also acclimated crickets and fungi to constant or fluctuating conditions. Crickets acclimated to fluctuating conditions survived best under constant conditions if paired with warm-acclimated fungus. Overall, matches and mismatches in thermal performance, driven by acclimation, determined host survival. Mismatched performance also determined differences in survival under different fluctuating thermal regimes: crickets survived best when fluctuating temperatures favored their performance (from 67 to 257C), compared with fluctuations that favored fungus performance (from 67 to 187C). Thus, we could predict the outcome of infection under fluctuating temperatures by averaging relative host-pathogen performance under constant temperatures, suggesting that it may be possible to predict responses to fluctuating temperatures for at least some biotic interactions. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Wild relatives of crops thrive in habitats where environmental conditions can be restrictive for productivity and survival of cultivated species. The genetic basis of this variability, particularly for tolerance to high temperatures, is not well understood. We examined the capacity of wild and cultivated accessions to acclimate to rapid temperature elevations that cause heat stress (HS). We investigated genotypic variation in thermotolerance of seedlings of wild and cultivated accessions. The contribution of polymorphisms associated with thermotolerance variation was examined regarding alterations in function of the identified gene. We show that tomato germplasm underwent a progressive loss of acclimation to strong temperature elevations. Sensitivity is associated with intronic polymorphisms in the HS transcription factor HsfA2 which affect the splicing efficiency of its pre-mRNA. Intron splicing in wild species results in increased synthesis of isoform HsfA2-II, implicated in the early stress response, at the expense of HsfA2-I which is involved in establishing short-term acclimation and thermotolerance. We propose that the selection for modern HsfA2 haplotypes reduced the ability of cultivated tomatoes to rapidly acclimate to temperature elevations, but enhanced their short-term acclimation capacity. Hence, we provide evidence that alternative splicing has a central role in the definition of plant fitness plasticity to stressful conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Accelerating shifts in global climate have focused the attention of ecologists and physiologists on extreme environmental events. However, the dynamic process of physiological acclimatization complicates study of these events' consequences. Depending on the range of plasticity and the amplitude and speed of environmental variation, physiology can be either in tune with the surroundings or dangerously out of synch. We implement a modified quantitative approach to identifying extreme events in environmental records, proposing that organisms are stressed by deviations of the environment from the current level of acclimatization, rather than by the environment's absolute state. This approach facilitates an unambiguous null model for the consequences of environmental variation, identifying a unique subset of events as 'extremes'. Specifically, it allows one to examine how both the temporal extent (the acclimatization window) and type of an environmental signal affect the magnitude and timing of extreme environmental events. For example, if physiology responds to the moving average of past conditions, a longer acclimatization window generally results in greater imposed stress. If instead physiology responds to historical maxima, longer acclimatization windows reduce imposed stress, albeit perhaps at greater constitutive cost. This approach should be further informed and tested with empirical experiments addressing the history-dependent nature of acclimatization. © 2020 Massachussetts Medical Society.

abstract={To mitigate the impacts of heat exposure, animals can take some actions to maintain their core body temperature, such as heat acclimation; however, the effect of heat acclimation on anxiety-like behavior in an open field is still not understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the anxiety-like behavior of heat acclimated rats in a temperate or heated open field. After being raised in a 23 °C environment for one week, male Wistar rats were exposed to a heated environment (32 °C) for 3 h (3H), 14 days (14D), or 28 days (28D), with free access to food and water, and compared with rats reared in a temperate environment (23 °C; Cont). After heat exposure, behavioral changes were monitored using an open field test (OFT) in a heated (32 °C) or temperate environment (23 °C). Compared with those in the Cont group, the body weights of rats in the 14D and 28D groups were lower. The OFT in the heated environment showed that grooming time was longer in 3H and 14D rats. In the temperate environment, grooming time was longer in all the heated groups. Rats from the 3H and 28D groups spent longer time in the center square when tested in the temperate environment. Rearing activity increased in 28D rats in the temperate environment, while the number of line crossings did not differ significantly between the heated groups and the two open fields. These results suggest that heat acclimation affected not only the physiological index such as core body temperature but also the anxiety-like behavior, mainly in the temperate open field. These changes might be beneficial when rats are faced with an open field. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mitochondria provide the vast majority of cellular energy available to eukaryotes. Therefore, adjustments in mitochondrial function through genetic changes in mitochondrial or nuclear-encoded genes might underlie environmental adaptation. Environmentally induced plasticity in mitochondrial function is also common, especially in response to thermal acclimation in aquatic systems. Here, we examined mitochondrial function in mayfly larvae (Baetis and Drunella spp.) from high and low elevation mountain streams during thermal acclimation to ecologically relevant temperatures. A multi-substrate titration protocol was used to evaluate different respiratory states in isolated mitochondria, along with cytochrome oxidase and citrate synthase activities. In general, maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency decreased during acclimation to higher temperatures, suggesting montane insects may be especially vulnerable to rapid climate change. Consistent with predictions of the climate variability hypothesis, mitochondria from Baetis collected at a low elevation site with highly variable daily and seasonal temperatures exhibited greater thermal tolerance than Baetis from a high elevation site with comparatively stable temperatures. However, mitochondrial phenotypes were more resilient than whole-organism phenotypes in the face of thermal stress. These results highlight the complex relationships between mitochondrial and organismal genotypes, phenotypes and environmental adaptation. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

N fertilization increased A in warm weather as soil moisture increased, and assimilation became saturated when the environment was sufficiently favorable, and excess soil N significantly restrained A in cold weather. The plants were much more sensitive to soil water availability than N content and terpene emissions increased synergistically due to heat and drought stress in hot weather. N fertilization did not significantly affect isoprene emission but significantly increased total terpene emissions and decreased the diversity of terpenes. Our results suggest a successful acclimation of plants by emitting more isoprenoids under environmental stress and that N deposition will further stimulate emissions as the Mediterranean region becomes warmer and drier. The results highlight the necessity for predicting the most realistic future of ecosystems under global environmental change and for assessing the impacts of multiple factors acting in concert on plant physiological and ecosystem functioning including biogenic VOC emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There is increasing evidence for considerable phenotypic flexibility in endotherm thermal physiology, a phenomenon with far-reaching implications for the evolution of traits related to heat tolerance. Numerous studies have documented intraspecific variation in avian thermoregulatory traits, but few have revealed the shapes of thermoregulatory reaction norms or how these might vary among populations. We investigated phenotypic flexibility in the ability of a model Afrotropical passerine bird (the white-browed sparrow-weaver, Plocepasser mahali) to handle high air temperatures (Ta). We allocated birds from three sites varying by ~ 11 °C in mean daily summer maximum Ta to three acclimation temperature (Taccl) treatments (daytime Taccl ≈ 30 °C, 36 °C or 42 °C respectively; n ≈ 10 per site per Taccl). After an acclimation period of 30 days, heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity was quantified by exposing birds to progressively higher Ta until they approached severe hyperthermia (body temperature [Tb] = 44.5 °C; Ta range: 38–54 °C). We measured metabolic rate and evaporative water loss using open flow-through respirometry, and Tb using temperature-sensitive passive-integrated transponder tags. Hyperthermia threshold Ta (Ta,HT) was significantly higher and Tb significantly lower in birds acclimated to the hottest Taccl compared to those from milder acclimation treatments. Population (i.e., site of capture) was not a significant predictor of any thermoregulatory variables or hyperthermia threshold Ta (Ta,HT) after acclimation, revealing that the shape of reaction norms for heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity does not vary among these three populations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A fitness benefit of phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to survive short-term, deleterious environmental fluctuations. Yet the influence of selection on plasticity in modulating shifts in phenotypic traits remains unclear. Short-term phenotypic plasticity in thermal tolerance traits is attained by exposure to sublethal hot or cold temperatures (i.e., the hardening response). Heat hardening is expected to buffer organisms from the unpredictability of extreme thermal fluctuations in the environment so as to minimize interruptions in activity and enhance survival. However, exposure to sublethal temperatures might entail other phenotypic costs that constrain or inhibit the prolonged use of hardening responses across longer timescales. Here we estimated the onset of the heat hardening response, physiological and behavioral shifts during heat hardening, and geographic variation in heat hardening using tree lizards (Uro-saurus ornatus). Peak heat hardening occurred 6 h after exposure to sublethal temperatures. We found that both preferred body temperatures and locomotor performance diminished following exposure to sublethal temperatures, and performance levels did not approach preexposure levels until after the peak hardening response. We also found support for intraspecific variation in the hardening response along an environmental gradient, where populations in more thermally variable environments exhibited stronger plastic responses and populations with higher baseline heat tolerances exhibited weaker plastic responses. Sublethal temperature exposure might induce adaptive plasticity in thermal tolerance; however, we find that these responses entail other phenotypic shifts that might curtail chronic reliance on plasticity in thermal traits as a mechanism of responding to changes in thermal environments induced by climate warming. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Background: Low temperature restricts the planting range of all crops, but cold acclimation induces adaption to cold stress in many plants. Camellia sinensis, a perennial evergreen tree that is the source of tea, is mainly grown in warm areas. Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS) has greater cold tolerance than Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA). To gain deep insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation, we investigated the physiological responses and transcriptome profiles by RNA-Seq in two tea varieties, cold resistant SCZ (classified as CSS) and cold susceptible YH9 (classified as CSA), during cold acclimation. Results: Under freezing stress, lower relative electrical conductivity and higher chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) values were detected in SCZ than in YH9 when subjected to freezing acclimation. During cold treatment, 6072 and 7749 DEGs were observed for SCZ and YH9, respectively. A total of 978 DEGs were common for both SCZ and YH9 during the entire cold acclimation process. DEGs were enriched in pathways of photosynthesis, hormone signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation of plant-pathogen interactions. Further analyses indicated that decreased expression of Lhca2 and higher expression of SnRK2.8 are correlated with cold tolerance in SCZ. Conclusions: Compared with CSA, CSS was significantly more resistant to freezing after cold acclimation, and this increased resistance was associated with an earlier expression of cold-induced genes. Because the greater transcriptional differentiation during cold acclimation in SCZ may contribute to its greater cold tolerance, our studies identify specific genes involved in photoinhibition, ABA signal conduction, and plant immunity that should be studied for understanding the processes involved in cold tolerance. Marker-assisted breeding focused on the allelic variation at these loci provides an avenue for the possible generation of CSA cultivars that have CSS-level cold tolerance. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Concomitant to the decline of tropical corals caused by increasing global sea temperatures is the potential removal of barriers to species range expansions into subtropical and temperate habitats. In these habitats, species must tolerate lower annual mean temperature, wider annual temperature ranges and lower minimum temperatures. To understand ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries, we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4 - 68C lower than tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity. This constraint on rapid reef accretion within subtropical environments provides insight into the global distribution of future coral reefs and their ecosystem services. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Ectotherms utilise a complex array of behavioural and physiological mechanisms to cope with variation in suboptimal thermal environments. However, these mechanisms may be insufficient for population persistence under contemporary climate change, resulting in a greater need to understand how local populations respond to geographic variation in climate. In this study, we explored the potential for local adaptation and acclimation in thermal traits and behaviours using wild and captive populations of a small agamid lizard (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus). We predicted that wild lizards from a high elevation site would have cooler thermal preferences compared to those at low elevation sites to match the more restricted thermal resources at higher, cooler elevations. We additionally explored whether variation in thermal traits was due to recent acclimation or fixed population differences, such as due to developmental plasticity or local adaptation. In contrast to our predictions, we found high-elevation lizards began panting at higher temperatures and had higher thermal preferences relative to lower elevation lizards. When allowed to bask freely, there was no difference in the intensity of basking or daily duration of time spent basking between lizards from different elevations. Although the high-elevation lizards appeared to show stronger acclimation to recent air temperatures compared to low-elevation lizards, this difference was not significant. Similarly, captive lizards acclimated under long and short basking regimes showed no major differences in thermal traits or basking behaviour. Our results are consistent with the presence of counter-gradient variation in thermal phenotypes of lizards, and suggest that these are driven by local adaptive responses or developmental effects rather than recent acclimation. © 2019},

abstract={Under future climates, leaf temperature (Tl) will be higher and more variable. This will affect plant carbon (C) balance because photosynthesis and respiration both respond to short-term (subdaily) fluctuations in Tl and acclimate in the longer term (days to months). This study asks the question: To what extent can the potential and speed of photosynthetic acclimation buffer leaf C gain from rising and increasing variable Tl? We quantified how increases in the mean and variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO2 assimilation rates, Anet; its variability; and time under near-optimal photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this aim, the probability distribution of Anet was obtained by combining a probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in Tl with data on Anet responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and 111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a) expected increases in Tl variability will decrease mean Anet and increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean Tl depend on species and initial Tl, and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of leaf warming, maintaining Anet at &gt;80% of its maximum under most thermal regimes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Extant deep-sea fauna, including hydrothermal vent endemics such as bresiliid shrimp, are descended from shallow-water ancestors. Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of shallow-water shrimp to acclimate to hydrostatic pressure representative of the vent environment. It has been proposed that this hyperbaric acclimation depends in part on shifts in phospholipid fatty acid composition to maintain biomembrane function. These shifts are also predicted to reduce critical temperature tolerance, potentially limiting the possibility of direct colonisation of the hydrothermal vent environment. Here, we present evidence that acclimation to high hydrostatic pressure (10 MPa ≈ 1000 m water depth) decreases acute temperature tolerance from 30.2 °C to 27.1 °C in the shallow-water shrimp Palaemon varians acclimated to 10 °C. Statistically significant shifts in phospholipid fatty acid composition occurred during exposure to high hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that homeoviscous modifications support shifts in environmental tolerances during hyperbaric acclimation. Despite the reduction in temperature tolerance, P. varians retains sufficient thermal scope to tolerate the thermal regime in the hydrothermal vent environment, allowing for the possibility of direct deep-sea hydrothermal vent colonisation by shallow-water shrimp. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In seasonal environments, natural selection should favor genotypes that acclimate to slow and predictable changes in temperature. Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16° or 26 °C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14° to 36°C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 °C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 °C, instead of 26 °C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 °C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 °C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 °C or 26 °C after developing at this temperature. Overall, these data provide only weak support for the models of optimal acclimation in seasonal environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Environmental adaptability is essential for plant survival. Though it is well known that a simple cooling or cold shock leads to Ca 2+ signals, direct evidence has not been provided that plants use Ca 2+ signals as a second messenger in the cold acclimation (CA) process in the field. By developing a technique to analyze Ca 2+ signals using confocal cryomicroscopy, we investigated Ca 2+ signals under several temperature conditions by combining the start temperature, cooling rate and cooling time duration. In both root and leaf cells, Ca 2+ signals rapidly disappeared after cooling stopped, and thereafter under a constant low temperature no Ca 2+ signal was observed. Interestingly, under the cooling regime from 2°C to â '2°C, non-acclimated plants grown at 23°C hardly showed Ca 2+ signals, but cold-acclimated plants at 2°C were able to form Ca 2+ signals in root cells. These findings suggest that plants sense temperature decreases with Ca 2+ signals while adjusting the temperature sensitivity to their own temperature environment. Furthermore, if the temperature is constant, no Ca 2+ signal is induced even during CA. Then, we also focused on the CA under field conditions, rich in temperature fluctuations. In CA under field conditions, the expression patterns of CBF/DREB1 genes were distinctly different from those in artificial CA. Pharmacological studies with Ca 2+ channel blockers showed that the Ca 2+ -induced expression of CBF/DREB1 genes was closely correlated with the amplitude of temperature fluctuation, suggesting that Ca 2+ signals regulate CBF/DREB1 gene expression during CA under natural conditions. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Background: Phenotypic plasticity is a pervasive property of all organisms and considered to be of key importance for dealing with environmental variation. Plastic responses to temperature, which is one of the most important ecological factors, have received much attention over recent decades. A recurrent pattern of temperature-induced adaptive plasticity includes increased heat tolerance after exposure to warmer temperatures and increased cold tolerance after exposure to cooler temperatures. However, the mechanisms underlying these plastic responses are hitherto not well understood. Therefore, we here investigate effects of adult acclimation on gene expression in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana, using an RNAseq approach. Results: We show that several antioxidant markers (e.g. peroxidase, cytochrome P450) were up-regulated at a higher temperature compared with a lower adult temperature, which might play an important role in the acclamatory responses subsequently providing increased heat tolerance. Furthermore, several metabolic pathways were up-regulated at the higher temperature, likely reflecting increased metabolic rates. In contrast, we found no evidence for a decisive role of the heat shock response. Conclusions: Although the important role of antioxidant defence mechanisms in alleviating detrimental effects of oxidative stress is firmly established, we speculate that its potentially important role in mediating heat tolerance and survival under stress has been underestimated thus far and thus deserves more attention. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={We studied acclimation of leaf gas exchange to differing seasonal climate and soil water availability in slow-growing date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) seedlings. We used an extended Arrhenius equation to describe instantaneous temperature responses of leaf net photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (G), and derived physiological parameters suitable for characterization of acclimation (Topt, Aopt and Tequ). Optimum temperature of A (Topt) ranged between 20–33°C in winter and 28–45°C in summer. Growth temperature (Tgrowth) explained c. 50% of the variation in Topt, which additionally depended on leaf water status at the time of measurement. During water stress, light-saturated rates of A at Topt (i.e. Aopt) were reduced to 30–80% of control levels, albeit not limited by CO2 supply per se. Equilibrium temperature (Tequ), around which A/G and substomatal [CO2] are constant, remained tightly coupled with Topt. Our results suggest that acclimatory shifts in Topt and Aopt reflect a balance between maximization of photosynthesis and minimization of the risk of metabolic perturbations caused by imbalances in cellular [CO2]. This novel perspective on acclimation of leaf gas exchange is compatible with optimization theory, and might help to elucidate other acclimation and growth strategies in species adapted to differing climates. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Vitis vinifera is mainly cultivated in temperate areas, where seasons are well defined and winter conditions might be severe. To survive under these conditions during the dormant season, grapevines sense environmental parameters to trigger different protective mechanisms that lead to cold hardiness (CH). Crop yield and sustainability will be determined according to the level of CH reached in each organ. Moreover, different cultivars of V. vinifera exhibit different behavior throughout the dormant season, attaining a different status of CH. However, there is scarce information concerning how the same cultivar behaves under contrasting thermal environments. The aim of our research was to unveil how CH varies in trunks of the same cultivar under two contrasting environments and define which are the main thermal and biochemical parameters involved in this process. We submitted 2-year old plants of the same clone of cv. Malbec to two different thermal conditions: natural winter (control) and artificially warm winter (treatment). CH status, thermal and biochemical parameters in trunks were measured periodically over the dormant season, and this experiment was repeated for three years. Our results suggest that grapevine trunks subjected to a different environment reach dissimilar CH status, except at the end of winter. In addition, we determined that daily minimum temperature is the main thermal parameter that drives changes in CH. Also, we found that the total soluble sugars have the greatest relative weight in determining the CH compared with the other compounds evaluated. These results have practical implications in the establishment of vineyards for new growing regions. Moreover, with rising minimum temperature predicted by climate change scenarios, grapevines may be more vulnerable to cold events during the dormant season. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Because of their sessile lifestyle, plants cannot escape from heat stress and are forced to alter their cellular state to prevent damage. Plants, therefore, evolved complex mechanisms to adapt to irregular increases in temperature in the natural environment. In addition to the ability to adapt to an abrupt increase in temperature, plants possess strategies to reprogram their cellular state during pre-exposure to sublethal heat stress so that they are able to survive under subsequent severe heat stress. Such an acclimatory response to heat, i.e., acquired thermotolerance, might depend on the maintenance of heat memory and propagation of long-distance signaling. In addition, plants are able to tailor their specific cellular state to adapt to heat stress combined with other abiotic stresses. Many studies revealed significant roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulatory systems in the regulation of these various heat responses in plants. However, the mode of coordination between ROS regulatory systems and other pathways is still largely unknown. In this review, we address how ROS regulatory systems are integrated with other signaling networks to control various types of heat responses in plants. In addition, differences and similarities in heat response signals between different growth stages are also addressed. © 2018, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Global warming is emerging as one of the most critical threats to terrestrial and marine species worldwide. This study assessed the effects of simulated warming events in culture on two seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, which play a key role in coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea. Changes in fatty acids as key metabolic indicators were assessed in specimens from two geographical populations of each species adapted to different in situ temperature regimes. Total fatty acid (TFA) content and composition were compared in C. nodosa and P. oceanica from natural populations and following exposure to heat stress in culture. After heat exposure, individuals of C. nodosa and P. oceanica adapted to colder temperatures in situ accumulated significantly more TFA than controls. For both species, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased, and the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) increased significantly after the heat treatment. These results highlight that populations of both species living at warmest temperatures in situ were more thermo-tolerant and exhibited a greater capacity to cope with heat stress by readjusting their lipid composition faster. Finally, exposure of seagrasses to warmer conditions may induce a decrease in PUFA/SFA ratio which could negatively affect their nutritional value and generate important consequences in the healthy state of next trophic levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Human-induced thermal variability can disrupt energy balance and performance in ectotherms; however, phenotypic plasticity may play a pivotal protective role. Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 ± 0.5 °C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13–17 °C day−1 or widely variable 11–21 °C day−1) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 ± 0.5 °C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where Ucrit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum Ucrit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 ± 0.44 BL s−1 at 15 °C; narrowly variable: 4.52 ± 0.23 BL s−1 at 21 °C; widely variable: 3.90 ± 0.24 BL s−1 at 11 °C, mean ± s.e.m.). In combination, these findings suggest juvenile A. medirostris are resilient to daily fluctuations in temperature, within the temperature range tested here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity, broadly defined as the capacity of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype, is a key mechanism for how animals adapt to environmental (including thermal) variation. Vertebrate glucocorticoid hormones exert broadscale regulation of physiological, behavioral, and morphological traits that influence fitness under many life-history or environmental contexts. Yet the capacity for vertebrates to demonstrate different types of thermal plasticity, including rapid compensation or longer acclimation in glucocorticoid hormone function, when subject to different environmental temperature regimes remains poorly addressed. Here, we explore whether patterns of urinary corticosterone metabolites respond (i.e., evidence of acclimation) to repeated short-term and sustained long-term temperature exposures in an amphibian, the cane toad (Rhinella marina). In response to three repeated short (30-min) hightemperature (37°C) exposures (at 10-d intervals), toads produced urinary corticosterone metabolite responses of sequentially greater magnitude, relative to controls. However, toads subjected to 4 wk of acclimation to either cool (18°C)- or warm (30°C)- temperature environments did not differ significantly in their urinary corticosterone metabolite responses during exposure to a thermal ramp (18°–36°C). Together, these results indicate that adult toads had different, including limited, capacities for their glucocorticoid responses to demonstrate plasticity to different regimes of environmental temperature variation. We advocate further research as necessary to identify plasticity, or lack thereof, in glucocorticoid physiology, to better understand how vertebrates can regulate organismal responses to environmental variation. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Plant temperature responses vary geographically, reflecting thermally contrasting habitats and long-term species adaptations to their climate of origin. Plants also can acclimate to fast temporal changes in temperature regime to mitigate stress. Although plant photosynthetic responses are known to acclimate to temperature, many global models used to predict future vegetation and climate–carbon interactions do not include this process. We quantify the global and regional impacts of biogeographical variability and thermal acclimation of temperature response of photosynthetic capacity on the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle between 1860 and 2100 within a coupled climate–carbon cycle model, that emulates 22 global climate models. Results indicate that inclusion of biogeographical variation in photosynthetic temperature response is most important for present-day and future C uptake, with increasing importance of thermal acclimation under future warming. Accounting for both effects narrows the range of predictions of the simulated global land C storage in 2100 across climate projections (29% and 43% globally and in the tropics, respectively). Contrary to earlier studies, our results suggest that thermal acclimation of photosynthetic capacity makes tropical and temperate C less vulnerable to warming, but reduces the warming-induced C uptake in the boreal region under elevated CO2. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={High latitude forests will experience large changes in temperature and CO2 concentrations this century. We evaluated the effects of future climate conditions on 2 dominant boreal tree species, Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst, exposing seedlings to 3 seasons of ambient (430 ppm) or elevated CO2 (750 ppm) and ambient temperatures, a + 4 °C warming or a + 8 °C warming. Pinus sylvestris responded positively to warming: seedlings developed a larger canopy, maintained high net CO2 assimilation rates (Anet), and acclimated dark respiration (Rdark). In contrast, carbon fluxes in Picea abies were negatively impacted by warming: maximum rates of Anet decreased, electron transport was redirected to alternative electron acceptors, and thermal acclimation of Rdark was weak. Elevated CO2 tended to exacerbate these effects in warm-grown Picea abies, and by the end of the experiment Picea abies from the +8 °C, high CO2 treatment produced fewer buds than they had 3 years earlier. Treatments had little effect on leaf and wood anatomy. Our results highlight that species within the same plant functional type may show opposite responses to warming and imply that Picea abies may be particularly vulnerable to warming due to low plasticity in photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={We used instantaneous temperature responses of CO2-respiration to explore temperature acclimation dynamics for Eucalyptus grandis grown with differing nitrogen supply. A reduction in ambient temperature from 23 to 19 °C reduced light-saturated photosynthesis by 25% but increased respiratory capacity by 30%. Changes in respiratory capacity were not reversed after temperatures were subsequently increased to 27 °C. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured at prevalent ambient temperature varied little between temperature treatments but was significantly reduced from ~105 kJ mol−1 when supply of N was weak, to ~70 kJ mol−1 when it was strong. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured across a broader temperature range (20–40 °C) could be fully described by 2 exponent parameters of an Arrhenius-type model (i.e., activation energy of respiration at low reference temperature and a parameter describing the temperature dependence of activation energy). These 2 parameters were strongly correlated, statistically explaining 74% of observed variation. Residual variation was linked to treatment-induced changes in respiration at low reference temperature or respiratory capacity. Leaf contents of starch and soluble sugars suggest that respiratory capacity varies with source-sink imbalances in carbohydrate utilization, which in combination with shifts in carbon-flux mode, serve to maintain homeostasis of respiratory temperature sensitivity at prevalent growth temperature. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Thermal tolerance has a major effect on individual fitness and species distributions and can be determined by genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity. We investigate the effects of developmental and adult thermal conditions on cold tolerance, measured as chill coma recovery (CCR) time, during the early and late adult stage in the Glanville fritillary butterfly. We also investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance by associating CCR variation with polymorphisms in candidate genes that have a known role in insect physiology. Our results demonstrate that a cooler developmental temperature leads to reduced cold tolerance in the early adult stage, whereas cooler conditions during the adult stage lead to increased cold tolerance. This suggests that adult acclimation, but not developmental plasticity, of adult cold tolerance is adaptive. This could be explained by the ecological conditions the Glanville fritillary experiences in the field, where temperature during early summer, but not spring, is predictive of thermal conditions during the butterfly's flight season. In addition, an amino acid polymorphism (Ala-Glu) in the gene flightin, which has a known function in insect flight and locomotion, was associated with CCR. These amino acids have distinct biochemical properties and may thus affect protein function and/or structure. To our knowledge, our study is the first to link genetic variation in flightin to cold tolerance, or thermal adaptation in general. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Seasonal temperature changes may take organisms to the upper and lower limit of their thermal range, with respective variations in their biochemical and metabolic profile. To elucidate these traits, we investigated metabolic and antioxidant patterns in tissues of sea bream Sparus aurata during seasonal acclimatization for 1 yr in the field. Metabolic patternswere assessed by determining lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activities, their kinetic properties and plasma levels of glucose, lactate, and triglycerides and tissue succinate levels. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities and levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Xanthine oxidase (XO) activity was determined as another source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, we studied the antiapoptotic protein indicator Bcl-2 and the apoptotic protein indicators Bax, Bad, ubiquitin, and caspase as well as indexes of autophagy (LC3B II/LC3B I and SQSTM1/p62) in the liver and the heart to identify possible relationships between oxidative stress and cell death. The results indicate clear seasonal metabolic patterns involving oxidative stress during summer as well as winter. During cold acclimatization, lipid oxidation is induced, while during increased temperatures, warm-induced metabolic activation and carbohydrate oxidation are observed. Thus, oxidative stress seems to be more prominent during warming because of the increased aerobic metabolism. The seasonal profile of apoptosis and XO as another source of ROS matches the results obtained in the laboratory and are interpreted within the framework of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.},

To understand the strategies enabling survival of evergreens in these environments, we monitored seasonal changes in foliar gas exchange and photosynthetic traits of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen broadleaved shrub native to the cold desert of northwestern China. We found that photosynthesis was relatively higher in spring and summer and lower in fall and winter. Transitioning from spring to summer, A. mongolicus maintained high photosynthetic capacity (Amax). Transitioning into fall, the Amaxand maximum stomatal conductance (gsmax) decreased, while the relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (Ls) increased. In winter, A. mongolicus decreased Amax, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), maximum RuBisCo carboxylation rates (Vcmax), maximum RuBP regeneration rates (Jmax), and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) relative to other seasons. Collectively, these results suggest that A. mongolicus adapts physiologically to maximize carbon assimilation during spring and summer, and to maximize foliar resistance to cold stress at the expense of photosynthesis in winter. Foliage was protected against photo-oxidative damage during temperature extremes in winter by dark-sustained thermal energy dissipation. Overall, our study reveals that multiple photosynthetic adjustments, varying among the seasons, enable the survival of cold desert evergreens. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Local adaptation is common, but the traits and genes involved are often unknown. Physiological responses to cold probably contribute to local adaptation in wide-ranging species, but the genetic basis underlying natural variation in these traits has rarely been studied. Using a recombinant inbred (495 lines) mapping population from locally adapted populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from Sweden and Italy, we grew plants at low temperature and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for traits related to photosynthesis: maximal quantum efficiency (F v /F m), rapidly reversible photoprotection (NPQ fast), and photoinhibition of PSII (NPQ slow) using high-Throughput, whole-plant measures of chlorophyll fluorescence. In response to cold, the Swedish line had greater values for all traits, and for every trait, large effect QTLs contributed to parental differences. We found one major QTL affecting all traits, as well as unique major QTLs for each trait. Six trait QTLs overlapped with previously published locally adaptive QTLs based on fitness measured in the native environments over 3 years. Our results demonstrate that photosynthetic responses to cold can vary dramatically within a species, and may predominantly be caused by a few QTLs of large effect. Some photosynthesis traits and QTLs probably contribute to local adaptation in this system. © The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={Environmental variability is ubiquitous, but its effects on populations are not fully understood or predictable. Recent attention has focused on how rapid evolution can impact ecological dynamics via adaptive trait change. However, the impact of trait change arising fromplastic responses has received less attention, and is often assumed to optimize performance and unfold on a separate, faster timescale than ecological dynamics. Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as it acclimates to temperature changes. First, we show that C. reinhardtii’s gradual acclimation responses can both enhance and suppress its performance after a perturbation, depending on its prior thermal history. Second, we demonstrate that where conventional approaches fail to predict the population dynamics of C. reinhardtii exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasticity’s interactions with ecological dynamics. Amidst the current emphasis on rapid evolution, it is critical that we also develop predictive methods accounting for plasticity. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Boreal trees possess very high freezing resistance, which is induced by short-day length and low temperatures, in order to survive severe subzero temperatures in winter. During autumn, cooperation of photoreceptors and circadian clock system perceiving photoperiod shortening results in growth cessation, dormancy development, and first induction of freezing resistance. The freezing resistance is further enhanced by subsequent low temperature during seasonal cold acclimation with concomitant changes in various morphological and physiological features including accumulation of sugars and late embryogenesis abundant proteins. The mechanism of adaptation to freezing temperatures differs depending on the type of tissue in boreal trees. For example, bark, cambium, and leaf cells tolerate freezing-induced dehydration by extracellular freezing, whereas xylem parenchyma cells avoid intracellular freezing by deep supercooling. In addition, dormant buds in some trees respond by extraorgan freezing. Boreal trees have evolved overwintering mechanisms such as dormancy and high freezing resistance in order to survive freezing temperatures in winter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Light and temperature are major drivers in the ecology and biogeography of symbiotic dinoflagellates living in corals and other cnidarians. We examined variations in physiology among 11 strains comprising five species of clade A Symbiodinium. We grew cultures at 26oC (control) and 32oC (high temperature) over a duration of 18 days while measuring growth and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm). Responses to thermal stress ranged from susceptible to tolerant across species and strains. Most strains exhibited a decrease in cell densities and Fv/Fm when grown at 32oC. Tolerance to high temperature (T32) was calculated for all strains, ranging from 0 (unable to survive at high temperature) to 1 (able survive at high temperature). There was substantial variation in thermotolerance across species and among strains. One strain had a T32 close to 1, indicating that growth was not reduced at 32oC for only this one strain. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and light on physiological stress, we selected three strains with different levels of thermotolerance (tolerant, intermediate and susceptible) and grew them under five different light intensities (65, 80, 100, 240 and 443 μmol quanta m-2 s-1) at 26 and 32oC. High irradiance exacerbated the effect of high temperature, particularly in strains from thermally sensitive species. This work further supports the recognition that broad physiological differences exist not only among species within Symbiodinium clades, but also among strains within species demonstrating that thermotolerance varies widely between species and among strains within species. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={1. Population differences in physiological responses are examined in Thorectes lusitanicus, an endemic Iberian dung beetle species, by submitting individuals of different populations to the same experimental and acclimation conditions. 2. An infrared thermography protocol was used, consisting of three assays: start of activity, cold response, and heat response. Individuals of 12 populations were studied and the comparative explanatory capacities of several environmental factors in relation to the observed inter-population differences were examined. 3. The heating rate from chill coma to the beginning of activity was the variable with the highest discrimination power among the studied populations, accounting for 94% of the observed variance. Regarding the heat response, only six of the 16 thermal variables reached significance (inter-population differences accounted for 52–74% in these six thermal parameters). 4. From the three considered environmental factors (Mediterranean climate, land cover, and trophic characteristics) only land cover characteristics remain statistically significant, affecting the cold response of individuals. 5. Thorectes lusitanicus is a species characterised by a high diversity of thermotolerance and recovery traits across populations with a low degree of association with broad environmental factors. Finally, it is suggested that the apterous character of this species could be a determinant factor explaining the high diversity of ecophysiological traits related to thermal stress tolerance and the recovery time. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={Most research in physiological ecology has focused on the effects of mean changes in temperature under the classic “hot vs cold” acclimation treatment; however, current evidence suggests that an increment in both the mean and variance of temperature could act synergistically to amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 °C ± 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 °C ± 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Zmax), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the “vertical shift or faster-slower” hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={How the ability to acclimate will impact individual performance and ecological interactions under climate change remains poorly understood. Theory predicts that the benefit an organism can gain from acclimating depends on the rate at which temperatures change relative to the time it takes to induce beneficial acclimation. Here, we present a conceptual model showing how slower seasonal changes under climate change can alter species’ relative performance when they differ in acclimation rate and magnitude. To test predictions from theory, we performed a microcosm experiment where we reared a mid- and a high-latitude damselfly species alone or together under the rapid seasonality currently experienced at 62°N and the slower seasonality predicted for this latitude under climate change and measured larval growth and survival. To separate acclimation effects from fixed thermal responses, we simulated growth trajectories based on species’ growth rates at constant temperatures and quantified how much and how fast species needed to acclimate to match the observed growth trajectories. Consistent with our predictions, the results showed that the midlatitude species had a greater capacity for acclimation than the high-latitude species. Furthermore, since acclimation occurred at a slower rate than seasonal temperature changes, the midlatitude species had a small growth advantage over the highlatitude species under the current seasonality but a greater growth advantage under the slower seasonality predicted for this latitude under climate change. In addition, the two species did not differ in survival under the current seasonality, but the midlatitude species had higher survival under the predicted climate change scenario, possibly because rates of cannibalism were lower when smaller heterospecifics were present. These findings highlight the need to incorporate acclimation rates in ecological models. © 2017 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Energy expenditure and ambient temperature (Ta) are intrinsically linked through changes in an animal’s metabolic rate.While the nature of this relationship is stable, the breadth of change in thermoregulatory cost varies with body size and physiological acclimatization to season. To explore seasonal metabolic changes of small mammals, we studied a population of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in a seminatural environment with a year-round supply of natural and supplemented food. In each season we measured the metabolic rate of wildcaught red squirrels, using open-flow respirometry, and hypothesized that individuals would make adjustments to contend with seasonal weather conditions. In comparison to summer animals, we predicted that winter squirrels would show (1) an increase in metabolic rate within the thermoneutral zone, (2) a decrease in the lower critical temperature of the thermoneutral zone, (3) a shallower slope of restingmetabolic rate with decreasing Ta, and (4) lower thermal conductance. Surprisingly, we observed only minor changes in resting metabolic rate, and energetic modeling suggested that the scope of change was unlikely to be of ecological consequence. Hair area density was higher in winter than in summer, corresponding to a slightly elevated thermal conductance in summer, while body mass was reasonably constant year-round. We conclude that the scope of physiological seasonal adaptation is minimal when food is abundant and that squirrels instead rely on adjustments in activity to reduce exposure to low Ta. We suggest that thismay explain the squirrel’s success in a wide range of habitats, including urban areas, which require a rapid and flexible response to environmental changes and may indicate the capacity of other small mammal species to cope with environmental disturbance. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={The wintering strategy of the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) includes a naturally occurring decrease in food intake and body mass. Our aim was to investigate the conceivable role of the metabolic regulators, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), in the seasonal adaptation of the Djungarian hamster. In addition, a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), was studied. Relative protein expressions and phosphorylated forms (pAMPK and pACC) were determined by Western blot from subcutaneous white adipose tissues (sWAT), abdominal white adipose tissues (aWAT), interscapular brown adipose tissues (iBAT), skeletal muscle, and hypothalamus of winter-and summer-acclimatized hamsters. The winter group had higher AMPK expression in sWAT, aWAT, and iBAT, but the relative amount of phosphorylated protein (pAMPK/AMPK ratio) was lower in these tissues. Furthermore, ACC expression was higher in sWAT and iBAT of the winter animals. pACC (inactive form) levels were higher in all adipose tissues, yet a lower pACC/ACC ratio was detected in iBAT of the winter hamsters. Muscle AMPK expression was lower but pAMPK/AMPK ratio higher in the winter group. SIRT1 expression was higher in muscle and all adipose tissues of the winter hamsters. Hypothalamic protein expressions did not differ between the groups. Higher expressions of AMPK, ACC, and SIRT1 in WAT and iBAT of the winter hamsters suggest a role in the regulation of lipid reserves and increased thermogenic capacity characteristic to the winter-adapted Djungarian hamsters. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Leaf respiration (R) is a major component of carbon balance in forest ecosystems. Clarifying the variability of leaf R within a canopy is essential for predicting the impact of global warming on forest productivity and the potential future function of the forest ecosystem as a carbon sink. We examined vertical and seasonal variations in short-term temperature responses of leaf R as well as environmental factors (light and mean air temperature) and physiological factors [leaf nitrogen (N), leaf mass per area (LMA), and shoot growth] in the canopy of a 10-year-old stand of hinoki cypress [Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. et Zucc.) Endl.] in Kyushu, Japan. Leaf respiration rate adjusted to 20°C (R20) exhibited evident vertical gradients in each season and was correlated with light, LMA and leaf N. In contrast, the temperature sensitivity of leaf R (Q10) did not vary vertically throughout the seasons. Seasonally, Q10 was higher in winter than in summer and was strongly negatively correlated to mean air temperature. A negative correlation of R20 with mean air temperature was also observed for each of the three canopy layers. These results clearly indicate that leaf R was able to adjust to seasonal changes in ambient temperature under field conditions and down-regulate during warmer periods. We also found that the degree of thermal acclimation did not vary with canopy position. Overall, our results suggest that vertical and seasonal variations in temperature responses of leaf R within a hinoki cypress canopy could be predicted by relatively simple parameters (light and temperature). There was an exception of extremely high R20 values in April that may have been due to the onset of shoot growth in spring. Understanding thermal acclimation and variations in leaf R within forest canopies will improve global terrestrial carbon cycle models.},

abstract={Predation is a strong driver of population dynamics and community structure and it is essential to reliably quantify and predict predation impacts on prey populations in a changing thermal landscape. Here, we used comparative functional response analyses to assess how predator-prey interactions between dogfish and invertebrate prey change under different warming scenarios. The Functional Response Type, attack rate, handling time and maximum feeding rate estimates were calculated for Scyliorhinus canicula preying upon Echinogammarus marinus under temperatures of 11.3 °C and 16.3 °C, which represent both the potential daily variation and predicted higher summer temperatures within Strangford Lough, N. Ireland. A two x two design of “Predator Acclimated”, “Prey Acclimated”, “Both Acclimated”, and “Both Unacclimated” was implemented to test functional responses to temperature rise. Attack rate was higher at 11.3 °C than at 16.3 °C, but handling time was lower and maximum feeding rates were higher at 16.3 °C. Non-acclimated predators had similar maximum feeding rate towards non-acclimated and acclimated prey, whereas acclimated predators had significantly higher maximum feeding rates towards acclimated prey as compared to non-acclimated prey. Results suggests that the predator attack rate is decreased by increasing temperature but when both predator and prey are acclimated the shorter handling times considerably increase predator impact. The functional response of the fish changed from Type II to Type III with an increase in temperature, except when only the prey were acclimated. This change from population destabilizing Type II to more stabilizing Type III could confer protection to prey at low densities but increase the maximum feeding rate by Scyliorhinus canicula in the future. However, predator movement between different thermal regimes may maintain a Type II response, albeit with a lower maximum feeding rate. This has implications for the way the increasing population Scyliorhinus canicula in the Irish Sea may exploit valuable fisheries stocks in the future. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Temperature affects the physiology and life-history of ectothermic animals, often increasing metabolic rate and decreasing body size. Oxygen limitation has been put forward as a mechanism to explain thermal responses of body size and the ability to survive stress. However the time-scales involved in growth performance and heat tolerance differ radically. In order to increase our understanding of oxygen and temperature effects on body size and heat tolerance and the time scale involved, we reared Lymnaea stagnalis under six combinations of temperature and oxygen tension from hatching up to an age of 300 days and recorded shell length during this whole period. At the end of this period, we determined scope for growth by measuring food intake rate, assimilation efficiency, respiration rate and ammonium excretion rate at two different temperatures. We also measured the snails’ ability to survive heat stress (CTmax), both at normoxia and hypoxia. We found that scope for growth and long term growth performance were much more affected by interactions of chronic oxygen and temperature conditions during rearing than by acute conditions during testing. Furthermore, our study shows that individual variation in growth performance can be traced back to individual differences in rates of food and oxygen consumption. Developmental acclimation also gave rise to differences in CTmax, but these were relatively small and were only expressed when CTmax was tested under hypoxia. The large effects of rearing oxygen conditions on growth and other physiological rates compared to modest effects of test oxygen conditions on CTmax suggest that small effects of hypoxia on the short term (e.g. heat tolerance) may nevertheless have large repercussions on the long term (e.g. growth and reproduction), even in a pulmonate snail that can compensate for hypoxia to some extent by aerial respiration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Gap formation increases the light intensity in the forest understorey. The growth responses of seedlings to the increase in light availability show interspecific variation, which is considered to promote biodiversity in forests. At the leaf level, some species increase their photosynthetic capacity in response to gap formation, whereas others do not. Here we address the question of whether the interspecific difference in the photosynthetic response results in the interspecific variation in the growth response. If so, the interspecific difference in photosynthetic response would also contribute to species coexistence in forests. We also address the further relevant question of why some species do not increase their photosynthetic capacity. We assumed that some cost of photosynthetic plasticity may constrain acquisition of the plasticity in some species, and hypothesized that species with larger photosynthetic plasticity exhibit better growth after gap formation and lower survivorship in the shade understorey of a cool-temperate deciduous forest. We created gaps by felling canopy trees and studied the relationship between the photosynthetic response and the subsequent growth rate of seedlings. Naturally growing seedlings of six deciduous woody species were used and their mortality was examined for 8 years. The lightsaturated rate of photosynthesis (Pmax) and the relative growth rate (RGR) of the seedlings of all study species increased at gap plots. The extent of these increases varied among the species. The stimulation of RGR over 4 years after gap formation was strongly correlated with change in photosynthetic capacity of newly expanded leaves. The increase in RGR and Pmax correlated with the 8-year mortality at control plots. These results suggest a trade-off between photosynthetic plasticity and the understorey shade tolerance. Gap-demanding species may acquire photosynthetic plasticity, sacrificing shade tolerances, whereas gap-independent species may acquire shade tolerances, sacrificing photosynthetic plasticity. This strategic difference among species would contribute to species coexistence in cool-temperate deciduous forests. © 2017 The Author.},

abstract={Quantifying the adjustments of leaf respiration in response to seasonal temperature variation and climate warming is crucial because carbon loss from vegetation is a large but uncertain part of the global carbon cycle. We grew fast-growing Eucalyptus globulus Labill. trees exposed to +3 °C warming and elevated CO2 in 10-m tall whole-tree chambers and measured the temperature responses of leaf mitochondrial respiration, both in light (RLight) and in darkness (RDark), over a 20-40 °C temperature range and during two different seasons. RLight was assessed using the Laisk method. Respiration rates measured at a standard temperature (25 °C -R25) were higher in warm-grown trees and in the warm season, related to higher total leaf nitrogen (N) investment with higher temperatures (both experimental and seasonal), indicating that leaf N concentrations modulated the respiratory capacity to changes in temperature. Once differences in leaf N were accounted for, there were no differences in R25 but the Q10 (i.e., short-term temperature sensitivity) was higher in late summer compared with early spring. The variation in RLight between experimental treatments and seasons was positively correlated with carboxylation capacity and photorespiration. RLight was less responsive to short-term changes in temperature than RDark, as shown by a lower Q10 in RLight compared with RDark. The overall light inhibition of R was ∼40%. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of leaf respiration to temperature variation and that the responses of RLight do not simply mirror those of RDark. Therefore, it is important not to assume that RLight is the same as RDark in ecosystem models, as doing so may lead to large errors in predicting plant CO2 release and productivity. © 2017 The Author.},

abstract={Plasticity is a near-ubiquitous feature of the thermal physiology of ectothermic organisms. Understanding the significance of plasticity in evolutionary and ecological contexts requires determining whether observed plasticity is beneficial, and, if so, to what extent plasticity can compensate for environmental change (i.e. is plasticity ‘complete’ or ‘incomplete’). Using site-specific daily temperature records spanning several decades, we test the ‘beneficial acclimation hypothesis’ by calculating the number of days predicted to exceed the heat tolerance limits of 103 terrestrial ectotherm populations when incorporating observed taxon-specific plasticity and when plasticity is ignored. We find that heat tolerance plasticity can reduce the predicted number of overheating events, although the effects are clade specific with plasticity providing greater benefits to amphibians than to reptiles or arthropods. Despite these benefits, heat tolerance plasticity is incomplete; as temperatures rise, plasticity cannot prevent an increase in the risk of overheating. Specifically, we find that a one degree increase in mean maximum temperature leads to approximately one additional day of predicted overheating during the warmest months of the year, on average. We conducted a broad-scale analysis of the degree to which plasticity in heat tolerance reduces the probability that ectotherms experience temperatures beyond their physiological heat limits. Our results indicate that plasticity in heat tolerance benefits ectotherms, but, consistent with previous studies, those benefits are inadequate to provide complete compensation for global climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={We investigated the ability of juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) to acclimate to temperature with respect to growth rate. We hypothesized that alligators would acclimate to cold temperature by increasing the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscles and the heart. Additionally, we hypothesized that lipid membranes in the thigh muscle and liver would respond to low temperature, either to maintain fluidity (via increased unsaturation) or to maintain enzyme reaction rates (via increased docosahexaenoic acid). Alligators were assigned to one of 3 temperature regimes beginning at 9 mo of age: constant warm (30 °C), constant cold (20 °C), and daily cycling for 12 h at each temperature. Growth rate over the following 7 mo was highest in the cycling group, which we suggest occurred via high digestive function or feeding activity during warm periods and energy-saving during cold periods. The warm group also grew faster than the cold group. Heart and liver masses were proportional to body mass, while kidney was proportionately larger in the cold group compared to the warm animals. Whole-animal metabolic rate was higher in the warm and cycling groups compared to the cold group – even when controlling for body mass – when assayed at 30 °C, but not at 20 °C. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity in permeabilized fibers of thigh muscle and heart did not differ among treatments. Membrane fatty acid composition of the brain was largely unaffected by temperature treatment, but adjustments were made in the phospholipid headgroup composition that are consistent with homeoviscous adaptation. Thigh muscle cell membranes had elevated polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cold group relative to the cycling group, but this was not the case for thigh muscle mitochondrial membranes. Liver mitochondria from cold alligators had elevated docosahexaenoic acid, which might be important for maintenance of reaction rates of membrane-bound enzymes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Organisms possess a range of thermoregulatory strategies that may vary in response to sickness, thereby driving important life-history consequences. Because the immune system is vital to maintaining organism function, understanding the suite of immune responses to infection indicates basic costs and benefits of physiological strategies. Here, we assessed consequences of thermoregulation and seasonality on immune function in both immunologically stimulated and nonstimulated gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). An ectothermic vertebrate was used as an experimental model because the effects of thermoregulation on immunity remain understudied and are of increasing importance in light of anthropogenic alterations to thermal environments. We found that G. polyphemus increased body temperature (Tb) at 1 h after injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when compared with saline controls (P = 0.04), consistent with behavioral fever. LPS increased plasma bactericidal ability (BA; P = 0.006), reduced plasma iron concentration (P = 0.041), and increased heterophil∶lymphocyte ratios (P &lt; 0.001). In nonstimulated animals, thermoregulatory strategy had a strong effect on innate immunity, which demonstrated that individuals have the ability to facultatively adjust immune function when infection burden is low; this relationship was not present in LPS-injected animals, which suggested that animals stimulated with LPS maximize bactericidal ability independently of temperature. Seasonal acclimation state did not influence responses to LPS, although baseline plasma iron was significantly lower in animals acclimated to winter. These results support that a trade-off exists between immunity and other conflicting physiological interests. Moreover, these results clearly demonstrate the ability of indi viduals to modulate immune function as a direct result of thermoregulatory decisions. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Some insect taxa from polar or temperate habitats have shown cross-tolerance for multiple stressors but tropical insect taxa have received less attention. Accordingly, we considered adult flies of a tropical drosophilid-Zaprionus indianus for testing direct as well as cross-tolerance effects of rapid heat hardening (HH), desiccation acclimation (DA) and starvation acclimation (SA) after rearing under warmer and drier season specific simulated conditions. We observed significant direct acclimation effects of HH, DA and SA; and four cases of cross-tolerance effects but no cross-tolerance between desiccation and starvation. Cross-tolerance due to heat hardening on desiccation showed 20% higher effect than its reciprocal effect. There is greater reduction of water loss in heat hardened flies (due to increase in amount of cuticular lipids) as compared with desiccation acclimated flies. However, cross-tolerance effect of SA on heat knockdown was two times higher than its reciprocal. Heat hardened and desiccation acclimated adult flies showed substantial increase in the level of trehalose and proline while body lipids increased due to heat hardening or starvation acclimation. However, maximum increase in energy metabolites was stressor specific i.e. trehalose due to DA; proline due to HH and total body lipids due to SA. Rapid changes in energy metabolites due to heat hardening seem compensatory for possible depletion of trehalose and proline due to desiccation stress; and body lipids due to starvation stress. Thus, observed cross-tolerance effects in Z. indianus represent physiological changes to cope with multiple stressors related to warmer and drier subtropical habitats. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Climate change is increasing drought frequency, which may affect symbiotic N2 fixation (SNF), a process that facilitates ecosystem recovery from disturbance. Here, we assessed the effect of drought frequency on the ecophysiology and SNF rate of a common N2-fixing tree in eastern US forests. We grew Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings under the same mean soil moisture, but with different drought frequency caused by wet–dry cycles of varying periodicity. We found no effect of drought frequency on final biomass or mean SNF rate. However, seedlings responded differently to wet and dry phases depending on drought frequency. Under low-frequency droughts, plants fixed carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at similar rates during wet and dry phases. Conversely, under high-frequency droughts, plants fixed C and N at low rates during dry phases and at high rates during wet phases. Our findings suggest that R. pseudoacacia growth is resistant to increased drought frequency because it employs two strategies – drought tolerance or drought avoidance, followed by compensation. SNF may play a role in both by supplying N to leaf tissues for acclimation and by facilitating compensatory growth following drought. Our findings point to SNF as a mechanism for plants and ecosystems to cope with drought. © 2017 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2017 New Phytologist Trust},

Here we examined the relationship between thermal acclimation, thyroid hormones and oxidative metabolism in juvenile lake whitefish. Impacts of thermal acclimation above (19 °C) or below (8 °C) the thermal optimum (13 °C) and exposure to exogenous thyroid hormone (60 µg T4/g body weight) were assessed by quantifying citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities in liver, red muscle, white muscle and heart. Warm acclimation decreased citrate synthase activity in liver and elevated both citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities in red muscle. In contrast, induction of hyperthyroidism in warm-acclimated fish stimulated a significant increase in liver citrate synthase and heart cytochrome c oxidase activities, and a decrease in the activity of both enzymes in red muscle. No change in citrate synthase or cytochrome c oxidase activities was observed following cold acclimation in either the presence or absence of exogenous thyroid hormones. Collectively, our results indicate that thyroid hormones influence the activity of oxidative enzymes more strongly in warm-acclimated than in cold-acclimated lake whitefish, and they may play a role in mediating metabolic adjustments observed during thermal acclimation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

This distinction was most likely attributed to differences in the depletion of available carbon between constant high and varying high-temperature treatments, resulting in significantly higher rates of heterotrophic respiration in the varying high-temperature regime. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using Illumina, the varying high-temperature regime harbored higher prokaryotic alpha-diversity, was more dominated by the copiotrophic strategists and sustained a distinct community composition, in comparison to the constant-high treatment. We found a tightly coupled relationship between Q10 and microbial trophic guilds: the copiotrophic prokaryotes responded positively with high Q10 values, while the oligotrophs showed a negative response. Effects of vegetation stand and soil horizon consistently supported that the copiotrophic vs oligotrophic strategists determine the thermal sensitivity of CO2 flux. Our observations suggest that incorporating prokaryotic functional traits, such as shifts between copiotrophy and oligotrophy, is fundamental to our understanding of thermal acclimation of microbially mediated soil organic carbon cycling. Inclusion of microbial functional shifts may provide the potential to improve our projections of responses in microbial community and CO2 efflux to a changing environment in forest ecosystems. © FEMS 2017.

abstract={Physiological ecologists have long assumed that thermoregulatory behaviour will evolve to optimise physiological performance. The coadaptation hypothesis predicts that an animal's preferred body temperature will correspond to the temperature at which its performance is optimal. Here we use a strong inference approach to examine the relationship between thermal preference and locomotor performance in the caterpillars of a wingless sub-Antarctic moth, Pringleophaga marioni Viette (Tineidae). The coadaptation hypothesis and its alternatives (suboptimal is optimal, thermodynamic effect, trait variation) are tested. Compared to the optimal movement temperature (22.5 °C for field-fresh caterpillars and 25, 20, 22.5, 25 and 20 °C following seven day acclimations to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 5–15 °C respectively), caterpillar thermal preference was significantly lower (9.2 °C for field-fresh individuals and 9.4, 8.8, 8.1, 5.2 and 4.6 °C following acclimation to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 5–15 °C, respectively). Together with the low degree of asymmetry observed in the performance curves, and the finding that acclimation to high temperatures did not result in maximal performance, all, but one of the above hypotheses (i.e. ‘trait variation’) was rejected. The thermal preference of P. marioni caterpillars more closely resembles temperatures at which survival is high (5–10 °C), or where feeding is optimal (10 °C), than where locomotion speed is maximal, suggesting that thermal preference may be optimised for overall fitness rather than for a given trait. © 2016},

abstract={Basal metabolic rate (BMR) correlates with the cost of life in endothermic animals. It usually differs consistently among individuals in a population, but it may be adjusted in response to predictable or unpredictable changes in the environment. The phenotypic flexibility of BMR is considered an adaptation to living in a stochastic environment; however, whether it is also repeatable it is still unexplored. Assuming that variations in phenotypic flexibility are evolutionarily important, we hypothesized that they are consistently different among individuals. We predicted that not only BMR but also its flexibility in response to changes in ambient temperature (Ta) are repeatable on short- and long-term timescales. To examine this, we acclimated Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) for 100 d to winterlike and then to summerlike conditions, and after each acclimation we exposed them interchangeably to 10° and 28°C for 14 d. The difference in BMR measured after each exposure defined an individual’s phenotypic flexibility (ΔBMR). BMR was repeatable within and among seasons. It was also flexible in both seasons, but in winter this flexibility was lower in individuals responding to seasonal changes than in nonresponding ones. When we accounted for individual responsiveness, the repeatability of ΔBMR was significant in winter (τ = 0.48, P = 0.01) and in summer (τ = 0.55, P = 0.005). Finally, the flexibility of BMR in response to changes in Ta was also repeatable on a long-term timescale, that is, among seasons (τ = 0.31, P = 0.008). Our results indicate the evolutionary importance of the phenotypic flexibility of energy metabolism and suggest that it may be subject to selection. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Avian metabolic responses demonstrate considerable diversity under fluctuating environmental conditions, a well-studied example being the seasonal upregulation of basal metabolic rate (BMR) and summit metabolism (Msum) in temperate species experiencing harsh winters. Fewer studies have examined seasonal metabolic acclimatization in subtropical or tropical species. We investigated seasonal metabolic variation in an Afrotropical plo-ceid passerine, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali; ∼47 g), at three sites along a climatic gradient of approximately 7°C in winter minimum air temperature (Ta). We measured Msum (n ≥ 10 per site per season) in a helox atmosphere, BMR of the same birds at thermoneutrality (Ta ≈ 30°C), and resting metabolic rates at 5°C ≤ Ta ≤ 20°C. Patterns of seasonal adjustments in BMR varied among populations in a manner not solely related to variation in seasonal Ta extremes, ranging from BMR ∼52% higher in winter than in summer to no seasonal difference. Greater cold tolerance was found in a population at a colder desert site, manifested as higher Msum (∼25% higher) and lower helox temperature at cold limit values compared with a milder, mesic site. Our results lend support to the idea that greater variance in the pattern of seasonal metabolic responses occurs in subtropical and tropical species compared with their temperate-zone counterparts and that factors other than Ta extremes (e.g., food availability) may be important in determining the magnitude and direction of seasonal metabolic adjustments in subtropical birds. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Most vascular plants acclimate respiration to changes in ambient temperature, but explicit tests of these responses in field settings are rare, and how acclimation responses vary in space and time is relatively unstudied, hindering our ability to predict respiratory release of carbon under future climatic conditions. We measured temperature response curves of leaf respiration for three deciduous tree species from 2009 to 2012 in a field warming experiment (+3.4 °C above ambient) in both open and understory conditions at two sites in the southern boreal forest in Minnesota, USA. We analyzed the effects of warming on leaf respiration, and how the effects varied among species, times of season (early, middle and late parts of the growing season), sites, habitats (understory, open) and years. We hypothesized that the respiration exponent (Q10) of the short-Term temperature response curve and the degree of acclimation would be smaller under conditions where plants were more likely to be substrate limited, such as in the understory or the margins of the growing season. However, in contrast to these predictions, stable Q10 and strong respiratory acclimation were consistently observed. For each species, the Q10 did not vary with experimental warming, nor was its response to warming influenced by time of season, year, site or habitat. Strong leaf respiratory acclimation to warming occurred in each species and was consistent across most sources of variation. Most of the leaf traits studied were not affected by warming, while the Q10-leaf nitrogen and R25-soluble carbohydrate relationships were observed, and shifted with warming, implying that acclimation may be associated with the adjustment in respiratory capacity and its relation to leaf nitrogen and soluble carbohydrate content. Consistent Q10 and acclimation across habitats, sites, times of season and years suggest that modelingof temperature acclimation may be possible with relatively simple functions. © The Author 2017.},

abstract={Monitoring responses of plants to stresses in situ using the chlorophyll-fluorescence (ChlF) technique has been of growing interest, but challenged by lack of stable daytime indicators, limiting the method's application. Seasonal changes in diurnal responses of effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (ΦPSII) to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) have been assumed to reflect changes in physiological status of plants in changing environments. We examined the responses of diurnal ΦPSII to PAR in relation to environmental factors through continuous season-long monitoring of ChlF of PSII in a desert shrub species, Artemisia ordosica. Response data were analysed with a modification of the diurnal regression method by Durako (2012). Diurnal variation in ΦPSII for A. ordosica was largely controlled by PAR, decreasing with increasing PAR. The rates of the response of diurnal ФPSII to PAR (slopes) were down-regulated by seasonal changes in environmental factors, in particular, high values for daily mean air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and up-regulated with increases in soil water content (SWC). The y-intercepts of diurnal ФPSII-PAR regressions were linearly related to maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) during the growing season, increasing with increasing SWC. Our results confirm the suggestion by Durako (2012) that the y-intercept of diurnal ФPSII-PAR relationship serves as a good proxy for Fv/Fm in non-invasive monitoring of the physiological status of plants with the ChlF technique. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Warming oceans menace reef ecosystems by disrupting symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodinium zooxanthellae, thus triggering bleach episodes. Temperature fluctuations promote adjustments in physiological variables and symbiont composition, which can cause stress responses, but can also yield adaptation if fitter host–symbiont homeostasis are achieved. To understand such processes manipulative studies are required, but many reef-building cnidarians pose limitations to experimental prospects. We exposed Exaiptasia anemones to Gradual Thermal Stress (GTS) and Heat Shock (HS) exposures and monitored chlorophyll and symbiont dynamics to test the phenotypic plasticity of these photosynthetic holobionts. GTS enhanced chlorophyll concentrations and decreased Symbiodinium proliferation. A recovery period after GTS returned chlorophyll to lower concentrations and symbiont divisions to higher rates. HS triggered a stress response characterized by intense symbiont declines through degradation and expulsion, algal compensatory proliferation, and chlorophyll accumulation. Anemones pre-exposed to GTS displayed more acute signs of symbiont paucity after HS, demonstrating that recurrent stress does not always induce bleaching-resistance. Our study is the first documenting Symbiodinium C and D, along with the predominant Clade B1 in Exaiptasia anemones. C subclades found in outdoor specimens faded under laboratory exposures. Clade D emerged after HS treatments, and especially after GTS pre-exposure. This highlights the thermotolerance of D subclades found in E. pallida and shows that bleaching-recovery can involve shifts of background symbiont phylotypes. This study enlightens the capability of Exaiptasia anemones to acclimate to gradually increased temperatures, and explores into how thermal history influences in subsequent stress tolerance in symbiotic cnidarians. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Here however, we have investigated the impact of sex, rearing conditions, hardening, population, and laboratory rearing period on adult heat resistance in stocks of Drosophila hydei, a cosmopolitan species that occurs across a range of climatic zones. We show that population and putative laboratory adaptation effects are larger than those associated with rearing temperature and hardening, although there was also a notable interaction between hardening and sex, in that females showed a cost of hardening that was not present in males. In separate experiments, we found that environmental effects across a generation were small and similar in magnitude to those within a generation.

abstract={Temperature is critical for the survival and proliferation of animals, which must be adapted to cope with environmental temperature changes. In this study, we demonstrated natural variations in the phenotypes of temperature tolerance and temperature acclimation of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and we decoded whole genome sequence of six natural variations, which enabled us to map responsible gene polymorphisms onto specific chromosomal regions. The C. elegans laboratory strain, N2, survives at 2 °C after cultivation at 15 °C but is unable to survive at 2 °C after cultivation at 20 or 25 °C. This cultivation-temperature-dependent cold tolerance occurs within a few hours after the temperature shift and is termed cold acclimation. We measured the cold tolerance and cold acclimation phenotypes of many natural variants isolated from various areas. CB4854 showed weaker cold tolerance associated with gene polymorphisms on the sex chromosome decoded by whole genome sequencing. Variable cold acclimation phenotypes were exhibited in twelve natural isolates and the large difference was seen between CB4856 and AB1 strains. CB4856, isolated from Hawaii, acclimated slowly to a new temperature, whereas AB1, isolated from Australia, acclimated rapidly. By the whole genome sequencing analysis, two different polymorphisms responsible for the accelerated cold acclimation in AB1 were mapped to specific chromosomal regions. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Gill proteomes were analyzed by 2DE and 96 differentially expressed proteoforms were identified. Our results show that cell integrity appears to be maintained by the rise in molecular protective systems (i.e. Heat Shock Proteins), and by the reallocation of energy production via a switch to anaerobic metabolism and the setting up of alternative energy pathways. Finally, our results indicate that the response of mussels to acute thermal stress is conditioned by the acclimation temperature with an improved response in organisms acclimated to higher temperatures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The effects of warming on the temperature response of leaf photosynthesis have become an area of major concern in recent decades. Although growth temperature (GT) and day length (DL) affect leaf gas exchange characteristics, the way in which these factors influence the temperature dependence of photosynthesis remains uncertain. We established open-Top canopy chambers at the canopy top of a deciduous forest, in which average daytime leaf temperature was increased by 1.0-°C. We conducted gas exchange measurements for the canopy leaves of deciduous trees exposed to artificial warming during different seasons. The carbon dioxide assimilation rate at 20-°C (A20) was not affected by warming, whereas that at °C (A25) tended to be higher in leaves exposed to warming. Warming increased the optimal temperature of photosynthesis by increasing the activation energy for the maximum rate of carboxylation. Regression analysis indicated that both GT and DL strongly influenced gas exchange characteristics. Sensitivity analysis revealed that DL affected A without obvious effects on the temperature dependence of A, whereas GT almost maintained constant A20 and strongly influenced the temperature dependence. These results indicate that GT and DL have different influences on photosynthesis; GT and DL affect the 'slope' and intercept' of the temperature dependence of photosynthesis, respectively. © 2016 The Author 2016.

We measured light- and CO2 -saturated net photosynthesis (Amax ) and night-time dark respiration (R) each month at 25°C to quantify acclimation. Tree growth was measured, and leaf nitrogen (N) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations were determined to investigate mechanisms of acclimation. Warming reduced Amax and R measured at 25°C compared to ambient-grown trees. Both traits also declined as mean daily Tair increased, and did so in a similar way across temperature treatments. Amax and R (at 25°C) both increased as TNC concentrations increased seasonally; these relationships appeared to arise from source-sink imbalances, suggesting potential substrate regulation of thermal acclimation. We found that photosynthesis and respiration each acclimated equivalently to experimental warming and seasonal temperature change of a similar magnitude, reflecting a common, nearly homeostatic constraint on leaf carbon exchange that will be important in governing tree responses to climate warming. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Understanding how ticks survive the multitude of stresses experienced during winter is integral to predicting population dynamics and transmission of tick-borne pathogens. The American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), a predominant vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, overwinters in any of its post-egg life stages. In this study, we characterized the cold tolerance of larval D. variabilis and examined the effect of various acclimatory conditions on cold hardiness. Cold-shock survival during 2 h exposure to various subzero temperatures was assessed and a lower lethal temperature of −20 °C and a 50% mortality temperature near −16 °C was established. Larvae exposed to −5 °C showed high survival (∼70%) after 14 d and near 50% for up to 56 d at −5 °C. Larvae cycled between supra- and subzero temperatures showed better long-term survival than at constant −5 °C. The temperature of crystallization (Tc) was ∼−23 °C and no larvae survived freezing after reaching their Tc. Larvae exposed to inoculative freezing survived brief, mild treatments (70% survival of −5 °C for 2 h) but survival was reduced compared to larvae cooled in the absence of ice. Reduced photophase, rapid cold hardening, dehydration, and long-term thermal acclimation all improved larval cold hardiness to varying degrees. Survival data were compared to measurements of hibernacula conditions, and we conclude that larvae face little threat from cold-induced mortality but inoculative freezing does pose a risk, and the geographic distribution of D. variabilis is only minimally influenced by the ability of larvae to survive low temperature exposure. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={This study aimed to examine thermoregulatory responses in birds facing two commonly experienced stressors, cold and fasting. Logging devices allowing long-term and precise access to internal body temperature were placed within the gizzards of ducklings acclimated to cold (CA) (5°C) or thermoneutrality (TN) (25°C). The animals were then examined under three equal 4-day periods: ad libitum feeding, fasting and re-feeding. Through the analysis of daily as well as short-term, or ultradian, variations of body temperature, we showed that while ducklings at TN show only a modest decline in daily thermoregulatory parameters when fasted, they exhibit reduced surface temperatures from key sites of vascular heat exchange during fasting. The CA birds, on the other hand, significantly reduced their short-term variations of body temperature while increasing long-term variability when fasting. This phenomenon would allow the CA birds to reduce the energetic cost of body temperature maintenance under fasting. By analysing ultradian regulation of body temperature, we describe a means by which an endotherm appears to lower thermoregulatory costs in response to the combined stressors of cold and fasting. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Leaf functional traits are used in modeling forest canopy photosynthesis (Ac) due to strong correlations between photosynthetic capacity, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen per area (Narea). Vertical distributions of these traits may change over time in temperate deciduous forests as a result of acclimation to light, which may result in seasonal changes in Ac. To assess both spatial and temporal variations in key traits, we measured vertical profiles of Narea and LMA from leaf expansion through leaf senescence in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) forest. To investigate mechanisms behind coordinated changes in leaf morphology and function, we also measured vertical variation in leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C), predawn turgor pressure, leaf water potential and osmotic potential. Finally, we assessed potential biases in Ac estimations by parameterizing models with and without vertical and seasonal Narea variations following leaf expansion. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrostatic constraints on leaf morphology drive the vertical increase in LMA with height early in the growing season; however, LMA in the upper canopy continued to increase over time during light acclimation, indicating that light is primarily driving gradients in LMA later in the growing season. Models with no seasonal variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 11% early in the growing season, while models with no vertical variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 60% throughout the season. According to the multilayer model, the upper 25% of leaf area contributed to over 50% of Ac, but when gradients of intercellular CO2, as estimated from δ13C, were accounted for, the upper 25% of leaf area contributed to 26% of total Ac. Our results suggest that ignoring vertical variation of key traits can lead to considerable overestimation of Ac. © 2016 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Given the contrasting short-term temperature dependences of gross primary production (GPP) and autotrophic respiration, the fraction of GPP respired by trees is predicted to increase with warming, providing a positive feedback to climate change. However, physiological acclimation may dampen or eliminate this response. We measured the fluxes of aboveground respiration (Ra), GPP and their ratio (Ra/GPP) in large, field-grown Eucalyptus tereticornis trees exposed to ambient or warmed air temperatures (+3°C). We report continuous measurements of whole-canopy CO2 exchange, direct temperature response curves of leaf and canopy respiration, leaf and branch wood respiration, and diurnal photosynthetic measurements. Warming reduced photosynthesis, whereas physiological acclimation prevented a coincident increase in Ra. Ambient and warmed trees had a common nonlinear relationship between the fraction of GPP that was respired above ground (Ra/GPP) and the mean daily temperature. Thus, warming significantly increased Ra/GPP by moving plants to higher positions on the shared Ra/GPP vs daily temperature relationship, but this effect was modest and only notable during hot conditions. Despite the physiological acclimation of autotrophic respiration to warming, increases in temperature and the frequency of heat waves may modestly increase tree Ra/GPP, contributing to a positive feedback between climate warming and atmospheric CO2 accumulation. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Climate change and biological invasions pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Most analyses of the potential biological impacts have focused on changes in mean temperature, but changes in thermal variance may also impact native and invasive organisms, although differentially. We assessed the combined effects of the mean and the variance of temperature on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp90) in adults of the invasive fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the native Drosophila gaucha in Mediterranean habitats of central Chile. We observed that, under these experimental conditions, hsp90 mRNA expression was higher in the invasive species but absent in the native one. Apparently, the biogeographic origin and niche conservatisms are playing a role in the heat shock response of these species under different putative scenarios of climate change. We suggest that in order to develop more realistic predictions about the biological impact of climate change and biological invasions, one must consider the interactions between the mean and variance of climatic variables, as well as the evolutionary original conditions of the native and invasive species. © 2016 Boher, Trefault, Estay and Bozinovic.},

abstract={Isoprene is the most abundant type of nonmethane, biogenic volatile organic compound in the atmosphere, and it is produced mainly by terrestrial plants. The tropical tree species Ficus septica Burm. F. (Rosales: Moraceae) has been shown to cease isoprene emissions when exposed to temperatures of 12 °C or lower and to re-induce isoprene synthesis upon subsequent exposure to temperatures of 30 °C or higher for 24 h. To elucidate the regulation of genes underlying the disabling and then induction of isoprene emission during acclimatization to ambient temperature, we conducted gene expression analyses of F. septica plants under changing temperature using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Transcription levels were analyzed for 17 genes that are involved in metabolic pathways potentially associated with isoprene biosynthesis, including isoprene synthase (ispS). The protein levels of ispS were also measured. Changes in transcription and protein levels of the ispS gene, but not in the other assessed genes, showed identical temporal patterns to isoprene emission capacity under the changing temperature regime. The ispS protein levels strongly and positively correlated with isoprene emission capacity (R2 = 0.92). These results suggest that transcriptional regulation of ispS gave rise to the temporal variation in isoprene emission capacity in response to changing temperature. © 2016 The Author.

abstract={Corals are acclimatized to populate dynamic habitats that neighbour coral reefs. Habitats such as seagrass beds exhibit broad diel changes in temperature and pH that routinely expose corals to conditions predicted for reefs over the next 50-100 years. However, whether such acclimatization effectively enhances physiological tolerance to, and hence provides refuge against, future climate scenarios remains unknown. Also, whether corals living in low-variance habitats can tolerate present-day high-variance conditions remains untested. We experimentally examined how pH and temperature predicted for the year 2100 affects the growth and physiology of two dominant Caribbean corals (Acropora palmata and Porites astreoides) native to habitats with intrinsically low (outer-reef terrace, LV) and/or high (neighbouring seagrass, HV) environmental variance. Under present-day temperature and pH, growth and metabolic rates (calcification, respiration and photosynthesis) were unchanged for HV versus LV populations. Superimposing future climate scenarios onto the HV and LV conditions did not result in any enhanced tolerance to colonies native to HV. Calcification rates were always lower for elevated temperature and/or reduced pH. Together, these results suggest that seagrass habitats may not serve as refugia against climate change if the magnitude of future temperature and pH changes is equivalent to neighbouring reef habitats. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={There is interest in pinpointing genes and physiological mechanisms explaining intra- and interspecific variations in cold tolerance, because thermal tolerance phenotypes strongly impact the distribution and abundance of wild animals. Laboratory studies have highlighted that the capacity to preserve water and ion homeostasis is linked to low temperature survival in insects. It remains unknown, however, whether adaptive seasonal acclimatization in free-ranging insects is governed by the same physiological mechanisms. Here, we test whether cold tolerance in field-caught Drosophila subobscura is high in early spring and lower during summer and whether this transition is associated with seasonal changes in the capacity of flies to preserve water and ion balance during cold stress. Indeed, flies caught during summer were less cold tolerant, and exposure of these flies to sub-zero temperatures caused a loss of haemolymph water and increased the concentration of K+ in the haemolymph (as in laboratory-reared insects). This pattern of ion and water balance disruption was not observed in more cold-tolerant flies caught in early spring. Thus, we here provide a field verification of hypotheses based on laboratory studies and conclude that the ability to maintain ion homeostasis is important for the ability of free-ranging insects to cope with chilling. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål), is native to eastern Asia and is presently invading North America. Little is known about the exposure to and effects of winter temperatures in newly invaded regions on H. halys. The overwintering habitats that this species utilizes vary greatly in their thermal buffering capacity. They naturally overwinter in aggregations beneath loose bark on trees and in cliff outcroppings, but will also commonly aggregate in buildings. Effects of cold temperatures such as mortality and freezing have yet to be quantified in the invading population. We report that H. halys is chill intolerant (i.e., dies before reaching its freezing point), and that the degree of cold tolerance of populations in North America differs by season, sex, and acclimation location. The mean winter supercooling point (± SEM) of individuals acclimated in Minnesota was -17.06°C ± 0.13 and in Virginia was -13.90°C ± 0.09. By using laboratory assays of lower lethal temperatures and ambient air temperature records, we accurately forecasted mortality for field experiments in Minnesota and Virginia. Temperature refugia provided by human-built structures are likely crucial for overwintering survival during atypically cold winters and possibly contribute to the northern geographic range expansion of this economically damaging insect in the temperate climates of North America. © 2016, Entomological Society of America.

abstract={Understanding susceptibility to bleaching may indicate how corals cope with increasing seawater temperatures resulting from climate change. In Belle Mare lagoon, Mauritius, Acropora muricata colonies at reef sites but not near the coast exhibited bleaching. We compared seawater temperatures and light intensity both on a summer day and a winter day at a reef station and a near-coast station. The total phenolic contents, non-enzymatic antioxidant activities of the coral holobiont, in situ photophysiological parameters of in hospite Symbiodinium as well as their cladal diversity were assessed. Both sites had comparable maximum temperatures but fluctuations were higher in the near-coast station (2–3 °C) compared to the reef station (1–1.5 °C) on both days. Light intensity was higher on the summer day than the winter day at both stations. Higher total phenolic contents and ferrous reducing antioxidant potential were observed in near-coast colonies than in reef colonies on the summer day. Only Clade A-like Symbiodinium sp. variants were detected at both locations, but higher maximum relative electron transport rates and maximum non-photochemical quenching were measured in near-coast colonies. Our data show that the near-coast colonies exhibited enhanced photophysiological responses, antioxidant activities and increased total phenolic contents in response to higher thermal and light fluctuations. This acclimatization may explain the variability in bleaching along a coast-reef scale. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Furthermore, birds acclimated to 15°C increased the dry mass of their liver and kidneys, but not their heart and pectoral muscles, and displayed higher state-4 respiration in the liver, kidneys, heart, and pectoral muscles, and higher cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity in liver, kidney, and pectoral muscle, compared with those kept at 35°C. There was a positive correlation between BMR and state-4 respiration in all of the above organs except the liver, and between BMR and COX activity in all of the above organs. Taken together, these data illustrate the morphological, physiological, and enzymatic changes associated with cold acclimation, and support the notion that the hwamei is a bird species from temperate climates that exhibits high phenotypic flexibility of thermogenic capacity. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity may buffer the selection pressures on organisms that inhabit novel or rapidly-changing environments. We investigated plasticity of thermal tolerance, energetic and water loss traits and their interaction with behaviour in a small-bodied, arboreal anuran (Hyperolius marmoratus Rapp, Hyperoliidae) undergoing rapid range expansion into the winter rainfall region of South Africa. After short-term exposure to three temperatures (acclimation treatments) commonly encountered in their historical and novel ranges, frogs exhibited a broad thermal tolerance range (mean±s.d.: 42.1±2.9°C) and higher plasticity in CTmax than in CTmin. Resting metabolic rate was lowest in cold-acclimated animals, while active metabolic rates were lowest in warm-acclimated frogs, likely reflecting compensation towards energy conservation. Evaporative water loss was not significantly altered by the acclimation treatments in either resting or active animals, indicating limited plasticity in this trait compared to metabolism. Our results suggest that plasticity of temperature limits and metabolism may benefit this species in variable environments such as those encountered in its expanded range. Lack of plasticity in water loss during resting and activity suggests that these frogs rely on their high cutaneous resistance and behavioural means to buffer climate variation. This study highlights the importance of synergistic interactions between physiology and behaviour in determining amphibian responses to temperature variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Insect performance is limited by the temperature of the environment, and in temperate, polar, and alpine regions, the majority of insects must face the challenge of exposure to low temperatures. The physiological response to cold exposure shapes the ability of insects to survive and thrive in these environments, and can be measured, without great technical difficulty, for both basic and applied research. For example, understanding insect cold tolerance allows us to predict the establishment and spread of insect pests and biological control agents. Additionally, the discipline provides the tools for drawing physiological comparisons among groups in wider studies that may not be focused primarily on the ability of insects to survive the cold. Thus, the study of insect cold tolerance is of a broad interest, and several reviews have addressed the theories and advances in the field. Here, however, we aim to clarify and provide rationale for common practices used to study cold tolerance, as a guide for newcomers to the field, students, and those wishing to incorporate cold tolerance into a broader study. We cover the 'tried and true' measures of insect cold tolerance, the equipment necessary for these measurement, and summarize the ecological and biological significance of each. Finally, we suggest a framework and workflow for measuring cold tolerance and low temperature performance in insects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: In the short-term, organisms acclimate to stress through phenotypic plasticity, but in the longer term they adapt to stress genetically. The mutations that accrue during adaptation may contribute to completely novel phenotypes, or they may instead act to restore the phenotype from a stressed to a pre-stress condition. To better understand the influence of evolution on the diversity and direction of phenotypic change, we used Biolog microarrays to assay 94 phenotypes of 115 Escherichia coli clones that had adapted to high temperature (42.2 °C). We also assayed these same phenotypes in the clones' ancestor under non-stress (37.0 °C) and stress (42.2 °C) conditions. We explored associations between Biolog phenotypes and genotypes, and we also investigated phenotypic differences between clones that have one of two adaptive genetic trajectories: one that is typified by mutations in the RNA polymerase β-subunit (rpoB) and another that is defined by mutations in the rho termination factor. Results: Most (54 %) phenotypic variation was restorative, shifting the phenotype from the acclimated state back toward the unstressed state. Novel phenotypes were more rare, comprising between 5 and 18 % of informative phenotypic variation. Phenotypic variation associated statistically with genetic variation, demonstrating a genetic basis for phenotypic change. Finally, clones with rpoB mutations differed in phenotype from those with rho mutations, largely due to differences in chemical sensitivity. Conclusions: Our results contribute to previous observations showing that a major component of adaptation in microbial evolution experiments is toward restoration to the unstressed state. In addition, we found that a large deletion strongly affected phenotypic variation. Finally, we demonstrated that the two genetic trajectories leading to thermal adaptation encompass different phenotypes. © 2015 Hug and Gaut.},

abstract={Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is a worldwide emerging pest of soft fruits, but its cold tolerance has not been thoroughly explored. We determined the cold tolerance strategy, low temperature thermal limits, and plasticity of cold tolerance in both male and female adult D. suzukii. We reared flies under common conditions (long days, 21°C; control) and induced plasticity by rapid cold-hardening (RCH, 1h at 0°C followed by 1h recovery), cold acclimation (CA, 5days at 6°C) or acclimation under fluctuating temperatures (FA). D. suzukii had supercooling points (SCPs) between -16 and -23°C, and were chill-susceptible. 80% of control flies were killed after 1h at -7.2°C (males) or -7.5°C (females); CA and FA improved survival of this temperature in both sexes, but RCH did not. 80% of control flies were killed after 70h (male) or 92h (female) at 0°C, and FA shifted this to 112h (males) and 165h (females). FA flies entered chill coma (CTmin) at approximately -1.7°C, which was ca. 0.5°C colder than control flies; RCH and CA increased the CTmin compared to controls. Control and RCH flies exposed to 0°C for 8h took 30-40min to recover movement, but this was reduced to <10min in CA and FA. Flies placed outside in a field cage in London, Ontario, were all killed by a transient cold snap in December. We conclude that adult phenotypic plasticity is not sufficient to allow D. suzukii to overwinter in temperate habitats, and suggest that flies could overwinter in association with built structures, or that there may be additional cold tolerance imparted by developmental plasticity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={For many terrestrial species, habitat associations and range size are dependent on physiological limits, which in turn may influence large-scale patterns of species diversity. The temperature range experienced by individuals is considered to shape the breadth of the thermal niche, with species occupying temporally and/or geographically stable climates tolerating a narrow temperature range. High-elevation environments experience large temperature fluctuations, with frequent periods below 0. °C, but Grylloblatta (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae) occupy climatically stable microhabitats within this region. Here we test critical thermal limits and supercooling points for five Grylloblatta populations from across a large geographic area, to examine whether the stable microhabitats of this group are associated with a narrow thermal niche and assess their capacity to tolerate cold conditions. Thermal limits are highly conserved in Grylloblatta, despite substantial genetic divergence among populations spanning 1500. m elevation and being separated by over 500. km. Further, Grylloblatta show exceptionally narrow thermal limits compared to other insect taxa with little capacity to improve cold tolerance via plasticity. In contrast, upper thermal limits were significantly depressed by cold acclimation. Grylloblatta maintain coordinated movement until they freeze, and they die upon freezing. Convergence of the critical thermal minima, supercooling point and lower lethal limits point to adaptation to a cold but, importantly, constant thermal environment. These physiological data provide an explanation for the high endemism and patchy distribution of Grylloblatta, which relies on subterranean retreats to accommodate narrow thermal limits. These retreats are currently buffered from temperature fluctuations by snow cover, and a declining snowpack thus places Grylloblatta at risk of exposure to temperatures beyond its tolerance capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Coping with cold winter conditions is a major challenge for many insects. In early spring we observed newly emerged Drosophila subobscura, which had overwintered as larvae and pupae. As temperatures increase during spring these flies are faced with higher minimum and maximum temperatures in their natural microhabitat. Thus, there is a potential costly mismatch between winter and early spring acclimatization and the increased ambient temperatures later in adult life. We obtained individuals from a natural Danish population of D. subobscura and acclimated them in the laboratory to 20. °C for one generation, and compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) to that of individuals collected directly from their natural microhabitat. The two populations (laboratory and field) were subsequently both held in the laboratory at 20. °C and tested for their CTmax and CTmin every third day for 28. days. At the first day of testing, field acclimatized D. subobscura had both higher heat and cold resistance compared to laboratory flies, and thereby a considerable larger thermal scope. Following transfer to the laboratory, cold and heat resistance of the field flies decreased over time relative to the laboratory flies. Despite the substantial decrease in thermal tolerances the thermal scope remained larger for field acclimatized individuals for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that flies acclimatized to their natural microhabitat had increased cold resistance, without a loss in heat tolerance. Thus while a negative correlation between cold and heat tolerance is typically observed in laboratory studies in Drosophila sp., this was not observed for field acclimatized D. subobscura in this study. We suggest that this is an adaptation to juvenile overwintering in temperate cold environments, where developmental (winter) temperatures can be much lower than temperatures experienced by reproducing adults after emergence (spring). The ability to gain cold tolerance through acclimatization without a parallel loss of heat tolerance affects thermal scope and suggests that high and low thermal tolerance act through mechanisms with different dynamics and reversibility. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Climate-related variations in functional traits of boreal tree species can result both from physiological acclimation and genetic adaptation of local populations to their biophysical environment. To improve our understanding and prediction of the physiological and growth responses of populations to climate change, we studied the role of climate of seed origin in determining variations in functional traits and its implications for tree improvement programs for a commonly reforested boreal conifer, white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). We evaluated growth, root-To-shoot ratio (R/S), specific leaf area (SLA), needle nitrogen (Nmass), total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and photosynthetic traits of 3-year-old seedlings in a greenhouse experiment using seed from six seed orchards (SO) representing the different regions where white spruce is reforested in QuCrossed D signbec. Height and total dry mass (TDM) were positively correlated with photosynthetic capacity (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs) and mesophyll conductance (gm). Total dry mass, but not height growth, was strongly correlated with latitude of seed origin (SO) and associated climate variables. Amax, gs, gm and more marginally, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) were positively associated with the mean July temperature of the SO, while water use efficiency (WUE) was negatively associated. Maximum rates of carboxylation (Vcmax), maximum rates of electron transport (Jmax), SLA, Nmass, NSC and R/S showed no pattern. Our results did not demonstrate a higher Amax for northern seed orchards, although this has been previously hypothesized as an adaptation mechanism for maintaining carbon uptake in northern regions. We suggest that gs, gm, WUE and PNUE are the functional traits most associated with fine-scale geographic clines and with the degree of local adaptation of white spruce populations to their biophysical environments. These geographic patterns may reflect in situ adaptive genetic differences in photosynthetic efficiency along the cline. © 2015 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract={Respiration from vegetation is a substantial part of the global carbon cycle and the responses of plant respiration to daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and light must be incorporated in models of terrestrial respiration to accurately predict these CO2 fluxes. We investigated how leaf respiration (R) responded to changes in leaf temperature (Tleaf) and irradiance in field-grown saplings of an evergreen tree (Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb. ex Spreng). Seasonal shifts in the thermal sensitivity of leaf R in the dark (Rdark) and in the light (Rlight) were assessed by allowing Tleaf to vary over the day in field-grown leaves over a year. The Q10 of R (i.e., the relative increase in R for a 10 °C increase in Tleaf) was similar for Rlight and Rdark and had a value of ∼2.5; there was little seasonal change in the Q10 of either Rlight or Rdark, indicating that we may be able to use similar functions to model short-Term temperature responses of R in the dark and in the light. Overall, rates of Rlight were lower than those of Rdark, and the ratio of Rlight/Rdark tended to increase with rising Tleaf, such that light suppression of R was reduced at high Tleaf values, in contrast to earlier work with this species. Our results suggest we cannot assume that Rlight/Rdark decreases with increasing Tleaf on daily timescales, and highlights the need for a better mechanistic understanding of what regulates light suppression of R in leaves. © 2015 The Author 2015.

abstract={Differences in the response to adverse environmental conditions among genotypes within local populations are important in determining the ability of local populations to cope with such conditions, especially for long-lived organisms like trees. Nevertheless, such differences and their relevance for acclimation have not been addressed to date, representing a gap in our understanding of tree growth and acclimation. Focussing on temperature and soil moisture we address this issue, evaluating 13 relevant physiological (i.e. gas exchange, leaf pigments) and leaf morphological traits (e.g. specific leaf area) and three traits related to growth partitioning for two growing seasons in 10 genotypes of the ecologically and economically important tree species silver birch (. Betula pendula Roth). Complex trait syndromes - a consistent association of plant traits characterising differences among genotypes - including physiological, leaf morphological and growth partitioning traits were identified. The relative investment in leaf mass, shoot-to-root ratio and net assimilation rate were most important for good growth. With regard to acclimation to adverse environmental conditions genotypes mostly acclimated in a similar way, but changes in allocation patterns may depend on genotype, even within a local population. Trees with a high net assimilation rate and a low leaf mass fraction and shoot-to-root ratio produced most biomass after two years of growth. Information on these traits could, in addition to growth, be useful in identifying material for forest regeneration that is robust with regards to expected climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Seasonal and daily thermal variation can limit species distributions because of physiological tolerances. Low temperatures are particularly challenging for ectotherms, which use both basal thermotolerance and acclimation, an adaptive plastic response, to mitigate thermal stress. Both basal thermotolerance and acclimation are thought to be important for local adaptation and persistence in the face of climate change. However, the evolutionary independence of basal and plastic tolerances remains unclear. Acclimation can occur over longer (seasonal) or shorter (hours to days) time scales, and the degree of mechanistic overlap is unresolved. Using a midlatitude population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show substantial heritable variation in both short- and long-term acclimation. Rapid cold hardening (short-term plasticity) and developmental acclimation (long-term plasticity) are positively correlated, suggesting shared mechanisms. However, there are independent components of these traits, because developmentally acclimated flies respond positively to short-term acclimation. A strong negative correlation between basal cold tolerance and developmental acclimation suggests that basal cold tolerance may constrain developmental acclimation, whereas a weaker negative correlation between basal cold tolerance and short-term acclimation suggests less constraint. Using genome-wide association mapping, we show the genetic architecture of rapid cold hardening and developmental acclimation responses are nonoverlapping at the SNP and corresponding gene level. However, genes associated with each trait share functional similarities, including genes involved in apoptosis and autophagy, cytoskeletal and membrane structural components, and ion binding and transport. These results indicate substantial opportunity for short-term and long-term acclimation responses to evolve separately from each other and for short-term acclimation to evolve separately from basal thermotolerance.},

During heating, AMPK activity increased as water temperature increased to a point, and maximum AMPK activity was detected at high, but sublethal, water temperatures. This pattern varied with season, suggesting that cellular mechanisms of seasonal thermal acclimatization affect basic metabolic processes during sublethal heat stress. There was a greater seasonal variation in the water temperature at which maximum AMPK activity was measured than in lethal water temperature. Furthermore, baseline AMPK activity varied significantly across seasons, most likely reflecting altered metabolic states during times of growth and reproduction. In addition, when summer-collected mussels were lab-acclimated to winter and spring water temperatures, patterns of heat stress mirrored those of field-collected animals. These data suggest that water temperature is the main driver of the seasonal variation in physiology. This study concluded that AMPK activity, which reflects changes in energy supply and demand during heat stress, can serve as a sensitive and early indicator of temperature stress in mussels. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The success of conifers over much of the world's terrestrial surface is largely attributable to their tolerance to cold stress (i.e., cold hardiness). Due to an increase in climate variability, climate change may reduce conifer cold hardiness, which in turn could impact ecosystem functioning and productivity in conifer-dominated forests. The expression of cold hardiness is a product of environmental cues (E), genetic differentiation (G), and their interaction (G × E), although few studies have considered all components together. To better understand and manage for the impacts of climate change on conifer cold hardiness, we conducted a common garden experiment replicated in three test environments (cool, moderate, and warm) using 35 populations of coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) to test the hypotheses: (i) cool-temperature cues in fall are necessary to trigger cold hardening, (ii) there is large genetic variation among populations in cold hardiness that can be predicted from seed-source climate variables, (iii) observed differences among populations in cold hardiness in situ are dependent on effective environmental cues, and (iv) movement of seed sources from warmer to cooler climates will increase risk to cold injury. During fall 2012, we visually assessed cold damage of bud, needle, and stem tissues following artificial freeze tests. Cool-temperature cues (e.g., degree hours below 2 °C) at the test sites were associated with cold hardening, which were minimal at the moderate test site owing to mild fall temperatures. Populations differed 3-fold in cold hardiness, with winter minimum temperatures and fall frost dates as strong seed-source climate predictors of cold hardiness, and with summer temperatures and aridity as secondary predictors. Seed-source movement resulted in only modest increases in cold damage. Our findings indicate that increased fall temperatures delay cold hardening, warmer/drier summers confer a degree of cold hardiness, and seed-source movement from warmer to cooler climates may be a viable option for adapting coniferous forest to future climate. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Many temperate ectotherms undergo thermal acclimation to remain functional over a wide range of body temperatures, but few studies have investigated whether populations of a single species have evolved differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance. Therefore, we asked whether the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance has diverged between northern and southern populations of eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens). We acclimated eastern newts from Florida and Maine to cold (6 °C) or warm (28 °C) conditions for 12 weeks. Following acclimation, we measured the burst speed of newts at 6, 11.5, 17, 22.5, 28, and 33.5 °C. We also measured the activities of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in skeletal muscle of newts. The newts from Maine were better able to acclimate to low temperature compared to newts from Florida. Regardless of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity of burst speed was higher in the Florida compared to the Maine population. In general, newts from Maine performed better at low temperatures, whereas newts from Florida performed better at high temperatures. The activities of CK and LDH were lower in cold compared to warm-acclimated newts in the Florida population, but acclimation did not affect the activities of these enzymes in the Maine population. The activities of CK and LDH do not explain differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance between populations. Our results demonstrate that the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of locomotor performance differ between northern and southern populations of eastern newts, suggesting that these traits readily adapt to the thermal environment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In plants from temperate climates such as Arabidopsis thaliana, low, non-freezing temperatures lead to increased freezing tolerance in a process termed cold acclimation. During cold acclimation, massive changes in gene expression and in the content of primary metabolites and lipids have been observed. Here, we have analysed the influence of cold acclimation on flavonol and anthocyanin content and on the expression of genes related to flavonoid metabolism in 54 Arabidopsis accessions covering a wide range of freezing tolerance. Most flavonols and anthocyanins accumulated upon cold exposure, but the extent of accumulation varied strongly among the accessions. This was also true for most of the investigated transcripts. Correlation analyses revealed a high degree of coordination among metabolites and among transcripts, but only little correlation between metabolites and transcripts, indicating an important role of post-transcriptional regulation in flavonoid metabolism. Similarly, levels of many flavonoid biosynthesis genes were correlated with freezing tolerance after cold acclimation, but only the pool sizes of a few flavonols and anthocyanins. Collectively, our data provide evidence for an important role of flavonoid metabolism in Arabidopsis freezing tolerance and point to the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of flavonoid metabolism in response to cold. It is well known that acclimation of plants to low temperatures elicits massive changes in gene expression and in the content of primary metabolites and lipids, but changes in secondary metabolites have not been characterized previously. We have analyzed the effect of cold on flavonol and anthocyanin content and on the expression of genes related to flavonoid metabolism in 54 Arabidopsis accessions covering a wide range of freezing tolerance.

abstract={For many organisms the ability to cold acclimate with the onset of seasonal cold has major implications for their fitness. In insects, where this ability is widespread, the physiological changes associated with increased cold tolerance have been well studied. Despite this, little work has been done to trace changes in gene expression during cold acclimation that lead to an increase in cold tolerance. We used an RNA-Seq approach to investigate this in two species of the Drosophila virilis group. We found that the majority of genes that are differentially expressed during cold acclimation differ between the two species. Despite this, the biological processes associated with the differentially expressed genes were broadly similar in the two species. These included: metabolism, cell membrane composition, and circadian rhythms, which are largely consistent with previous work on cold acclimation/cold tolerance. In addition, we also found evidence of the involvement of the rhodopsin pathway in cold acclimation, a pathway that has been recently linked to thermotaxis. Interestingly, we found no evidence of differential expression of stress genes implying that long-term cold acclimation and short-term stress response may have a different physiological basis. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={• Premise of the study: Cold tolerance is a critically important factor determining how plants will be influenced by climate change, including changes in snowcover and extreme weather events. Although a great deal is known about cold tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, it is not highly cold tolerant. This study examined cold tolerance and its genetic diversity in an herbaceous subarctic relative, Arabidopsis kamchatica, which generally occurs in much colder climates. • Methods: Thermal analysis and electrolyte leakage were used to estimate supercooling points and lethal temperatures (LT 50) in cold-acclimated and nonacclimated families from three populations of A. kamchatica. • Key results: Arabidopsis kamchatica was highly cold tolerant, with a mean LT 50 of −10.8 ° C when actively growing, and −21.8 ° C when cold acclimated. It also was able to supercool to very low temperatures. Surprisingly, actively growing plants supercooled more than acclimated plants (−14.7 vs. −12.7 ° C). There was significant genetic variation for cold tolerance both within and among populations. However, both cold tolerance and genetic diversity were highest in the midlatitude population rather than in the far north, indicating that adaptations to climate change are most likely to arise in the center of the species range rather than at the edges. • Conclusions: Arabidopsis kamchatica is highly cold tolerant throughout its range. It is far more freeze tolerant than A. thaliana, and supercooled to lower temperatures, suggesting that A. kamchatica provides a valuable complement to A. thaliana for cold tolerance research. © 2015 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract={To avoid winter frost damage, evergreen coniferous species develop cold hardiness with suitable phenology for the local climate regime. Along the elevational gradient, a genetic cline in autumn phenology is often recognised among coniferous populations, but further quantification of evolutionary adaptation related to the local environment and its responsible signals generating the phenological variation are poorly understood. We evaluated the timing of cold hardening among populations of Abies sachalinensis, based on time series freezing tests using trees derived from four seed source populations × three planting sites. Furthermore, we constructed a model to estimate the development of hardening from field temperatures and the intraspecific variations occurring during this process. An elevational cline was detected such that high-elevation populations developed cold hardiness earlier than low-elevation populations, representing significant genetic control. Because development occurred earlier at high-elevation planting sites, the genetic trend across elevation overlapped with the environmental trend. Based on the trade-off between later hardening to lengthen the active growth period and earlier hardening to avoid frost damage, this genetic cline would be adaptive to the local climate. Our modelling approach estimated intraspecific variation in two model components: the threshold temperature, which was the criterion for determining whether the trees accumulated the thermal value, and the chilling requirement for trees to achieve adequate cold hardiness. A higher threshold temperature and a lower chilling requirement could be responsible for the earlier phenology of the high-elevation population. These thermal responses may be one of the important factors driving the elevation-dependent adaptation of A. sachalinensis. © 2014 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

abstract={An assessment of the patterns of thermal acclimation of physiological processes of the stalked sea squirt Styela clava is needed to further understand growth patterns associated with large seasonal fluctuations in ambient temperature. The effects of different exposure temperatures on physiological processes of S. clava were measured at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C. The impact of temperature on energy balance at a whole organism level was then assessed by scope for growth (SFG) and net growth efficiency (K2) measures. Physiological rates of S. clava were well correlated with its dry tissue weight (DW). Positive allometry with DW indicated that all physiological rates investigated were generally higher in the larger individuals regardless of temperature. Some allometric equations (e.g., feces production rate vs. DW and respiration rate vs. DW) exhibited identical estimates of exponents, enabling accurate comparisons of the rates across temperatures. In contrast, disparities across temperatures of the values for the weight exponent were detected in other allometric equations, revealing that thermal effects on these rates have different degrees for large and small individuals. The SFG value in S. clava of different sizes was similar at lower temperatures (5-10°C), peaking at 15°C. The SFG was positive with a relatively constant K2 in this temperature range. This positive energy balance reflects the reduction in metabolic costs at lower temperatures. In contrast, increased metabolic costs at higher temperatures (20-25°C) resulted in lowered SFG and K2 values, indicating that the feeding rate did not increase as greatly in compensation for the increased metabolic costs at higher temperatures. The lowered absorption at 25°C (compared with 20°C) resulted in negative SFG and K2 values. Finally, our results confirm that the absence of compensatory adjustment to warmer conditions leads to energetic disruption at a whole organism level at such temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As rapid climate warming creates a mismatch between forest trees and their home environment, the ability of trees to cope with warming depends on their capacity to physiologically adjust to higher temperatures. In widespread species, individual trees in cooler home climates are hypothesized to more successfully acclimate to warming than their counterparts in warmer climates that may approach thermal limits. We tested this prediction with a climate-shift experiment in widely distributed Eucalyptus tereticornis and E. grandis using provenances originating along a ~2500 km latitudinal transect (15.5-38.0°S) in eastern Australia. We grew 21 provenances in conditions approximating summer temperatures at seed origin and warmed temperatures (+3.5 °C) using a series of climate-controlled glasshouse bays. The effects of +3.5 °C warming strongly depended on home climate. Cool-origin provenances responded to warming through an increase in photosynthetic capacity and total leaf area, leading to enhanced growth of 20-60%. Warm-origin provenances, however, responded to warming through a reduction in photosynthetic capacity and total leaf area, leading to reduced growth of approximately 10%. These results suggest that there is predictable intraspecific variation in the capacity of trees to respond to warming; cool-origin taxa are likely to benefit from warming, while warm-origin taxa may be negatively affected. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Oxygen demand generally increases in ectotherms as temperature rises in order to sustain oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria. The thermal plasticity of ectotherm metabolism, such as that of fishes, dictates a species survival and is of importance to understand within an era of warming climates. Within this study the whole animal O2 consumption rate of a common New Zealand intertidal triplefin fish, Forsterygion lapillum, was investigated at different acclimation temperatures (15, 18, 21, 24 or 25 °C) as a commonly used indicator of metabolic performance. In addition, the mitochondria within permeabilised skeletal muscle fibres of fish acclimated to a moderate temperature (18 °C Cool acclimation group—CA) and a warm temperature (24 °C. Warm acclimation group—WA) were also tested at 18, 24 and 25 °C in different states of coupling and with different substrates. These two levels of analysis were carried out to test whether any peak in whole animal metabolism reflected the respiratory performance of mitochondria from skeletal muscle representing the bulk of metabolic tissue. While standard metabolic rate (SMR- an indicator of total maintenance metabolism) and maximal metabolic rate (M˙O2 max) both generally increased with temperature, aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) was maximal at 24 °C, giving the impression that whole animal (metabolic) performance was optimised at a surprisingly high temperature. Mitochondrial oxygen flux also increased with increasing assay temperature but WA fish showed a lowered response to temperature in high flux states, such as those of oxidative phosphorylation and in chemically uncoupled states of respiration. The thermal stability of mitochondria from WA fish was also noticeably greater than CA fish at 25 °C. However, the predicted contribution of respirational flux to ATP synthesis remained the same in both groups and WA fish showed higher anaerobic activity as a result of high muscle lactate loads in both rested and exhausted states. CA fish had a comparably lower level of resting lactate and took 30 % longer to fatigue than WA fish. Despite some apparent acclimation capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria, the ATP synthesis capacity of this species is constrained at high temperatures, and that a greater fraction of metabolism in skeletal muscle appears to be supported anaerobically at higher temperatures. The AMS peak at 24 °C does not therefore represent utilisation efficiency of oxygen but, rather, the temperature where scope for oxygen flow is greatest. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many photosynthetic organisms globally, including crops, forests and algae, must grow in environments where the availability of light energy fluctuates dramatically. How photosynthesis maintains high efficiency despite such fluctuations in its energy source remains poorly understood. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana K+ efflux antiporter (KEA3) is critical for high photosynthetic efficiency under fluctuating light. On a shift from dark to low light, or high to low light, kea3 mutants show prolonged dissipation of absorbed light energy as heat. KEA3 localizes to the thylakoid membrane, and allows proton efflux from the thylakoid lumen by proton/potassium antiport. KEA3's activity accelerates the downregulation of pH-dependent energy dissipation after transitions to low light, leading to faster recovery of high photosystem II quantum efficiency and increased CO2 assimilation. Our results reveal a mechanism that increases the efficiency of photosynthesis under fluctuating light. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The influence of thermal history on temperature-dependent flight performance was investigated in an invasive agricultural pest insect, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies were exposed to one of four developmental acclimation temperatures (Tacc: 15, 20, 25, 30°C) during their pupal stage and tested at these temperatures (Ttest) as adults using a full-factorial study design. Major factors influencing flight performance included sex, body mass, Ttest and the interaction between Ttest and Tacc. Successful flight performance increased with increasing Ttest across all acclimation groups (from 10% at 15°C to 77% at 30°C). Although Tacc did not affect flight performance independently, it did have a significant interaction effect with Ttest Multiple comparisons showed that flies which had been acclimated to 15°C and 20°C performed better than those acclimated to 25°C and 30°C when tested at cold temperatures, but warm-acclimated flies did not outperform cold-acclimated flies at warmer temperatures. This provides partial support for the 'colder is better' hypothesis. To explain these results, several flight-related traits were examined to determine whether Tacc influenced flight performance as a consequence of changes in body or wing morphology, whole-animal metabolic rate or cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. Although significant effects of Tacc could be detected in several of the traits examined, with an emphasis on sex-related differences, increased flight performance could not be explained solely on the basis of changes in any of these traits. Overall, these results are important for understanding dispersal physiology despite the fact that the mechanisms of acclimation-related changes in flight performance remain unresolved. © 2014.

abstract={Increases in environmental temperature predicted to result from global warming have direct effects on performance of ectotherms. Moreover, cardiac function has been observed to limit the tolerance to high temperatures. Here we show that two wild populations of Atlantic salmon originating from northern and southern extremes of its European distribution have strikingly similar cardiac responses to acute warming when acclimated to common temperatures, despite different local environments. Although cardiac collapse starts at 21-23 C with a maximum heart rate of ∼\n150 beats per min (bpm) for 12 C-acclimated fish, acclimation to 20 C considerably raises this temperature (27.5 C) and maximum heart rate (∼\n200 bpm). Only minor population differences exist and these are consistent with the warmer habitat of the southern population. We demonstrate that the considerable cardiac plasticity discovered for Atlantic salmon is largely independent of natural habitat, and we propose that observed cardiac plasticity may aid salmon to cope with global warming. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={We evaluated seasonal variation in photosynthetic temperature dependence and its contribution to annual carbon gain in an evergreen understorey shrub, Daphniphyllum humile Maxim, growing at the forest border and in the understorey of a deciduous forest. Plants at both sites exhibited similar optimal temperatures for photosynthesis (Topt). The activation energy for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation (HaV) at both sites tended to be higher in summer than in spring or autumn, suggesting that HaV may be the controlling factor in the Topt shift in D. humile. In contrast to the seasonal changes in Topt, the maximum photosynthetic rate at the optimal temperature (Popt) differed between the two sites: it was lower in autumn than in summer at the forest border, but was the same in summer and autumn in the understorey. In the understorey plants, nitrogen content (Narea) increased in autumn, but this was not the case for forest border plants. In addition, Rubisco content increased significantly in autumn in the understorey leaves but decreased distinctly in forest border leaves. Increased Narea and Rubisco in understorey leaves resulted in increased in photosynthesis in autumn. Annual carbon gain was 30.8 mol·m-2 in forest border leaves and 5.8 mol·m-2 in understorey leaves. Carbon gain in understorey leaves during the short period after overstorey leaf fall and before snow accumulation was approximately 49% of annual carbon gain. Furthermore, autumn carbon gain calculated using activation energy of summer with autumn photosynthetic parameters underestimated the autumn carbon gain by as much as 31%. In conclusion, photosynthetic temperature acclimation may be a key factor in increasing annual carbon gain in understorey D. humile. © 2013 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

abstract={In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that maintain fitness across a range of conditions. However, costs of adaptation may generate fitness trade-offs and lead to some compromise between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here, we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20 populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in constant and variable thermal environments for 3 years. We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically, genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating environments. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Many biotic and abiotic variables influence the dispersal and distribution of organisms. Temperature has a major role in determining these patterns because it changes daily, seasonally and spatially, and these fluctuations have a significant impact on an organism's behaviour and fitness. Most ecologically relevant phenotypes that are adaptive are also complex and thus they are influenced by many underlying loci that interact with the environment. In this study, we quantified the degree of thermal phenotypic plasticity within and among populations by measuring chill-coma recovery times of lines reared from egg to adult at two different environmental temperatures. We used sixty genotypes from six natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled along a latitudinal gradient in South America. We found significant variation in thermal plasticity both within and among populations. All populations exhibit a cold acclimation response, with flies reared at lower temperatures having increased resistance to cold. We tested a series of environmental parameters against the variation in population mean thermal plasticity and discovered the mean thermal plasticity was significantly correlated with altitude of origin of the population. Pairing our data with previous experiments on viability fitness assays in the same populations in fixed and variable environments suggests an adaptive role of this thermal plasticity in variable laboratory environments. Altogether, these data demonstrate abundant variation in adaptive thermal plasticity within and among populations. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={In intertidal poikilotherms with wide geographic distribution, physiological variations are ubiquitous, due to phenotypic plasticity and/or individual geographic variation. Using the grapsid crab, Cyclograpsus cinereus as a study model, acclimatization differences in respiratory physiology were evaluated among populations along the Chilean coast, covering a latitudinal gradient of about 2000A km. This species inhabits the supratidal zones and, therefore, is subject to constant immersion and emersion periods, producing physiological acidification due to CO2 retention, mainly in the branchial cavity. Individuals of six populations were collected along the coastline of Chile and were exposed to air for different time periods in the laboratory. The following parameters were measured: pH, Ca2+, Cl - and haemolymphatic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity. Populations from lower latitudes were significantly different from those from central and southern Chile, with a higher haemolymphatic pH variation and higher Ca2+ level, along with lower levels of Cl- and LDH enzyme activity. This indicates that the populations from lower latitudes, which are subject to higher air temperatures during emersion, have a higher homeostatic capacity during emersion periods than those of intermediate and higher latitudes. This response seems to be determined by genetic bases due to adaptation to the local environment. © 2013 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.},

abstract={In the Western Himalayas, Drosophila nepalensis is more abundant during the colder and drier winter than the warmer rainy season but the mechanistic bases of such adaptations are largely unknown. We tested effects of developmental plasticity on desiccation-related traits (body size, body melanization and water balance traits) that may be consistent with changes in seasonal abundance of this species. D. nepalensis grown at 15°C has shown twofold higher body size, greater melanization (∼15-fold), higher desiccation resistance (∼55 h), hemolymph as well as carbohydrate content (twofold higher) as compared with corresponding values at 25°C. Water loss before succumbing to death was much higher (∼16%) at 15°C than 25°C. Developmental plastic effects on body size are associated with changes in water balance-related traits (bulk water, hemolymph and dehydration tolerance). The role of body melanization was evident from the analysis of assorted darker and lighter flies (from a mass culture of D. nepalensis reared at 21°C) which lacked differences in dry mass but showed differences in desiccation survival hours and rate of water loss. For adult acclimation, we found a slight increase in desiccation resistance of flies reared at lower growth temperature, whereas in flies reared at 25°C such a response was lacking. In D. nepalensis, greater developmental plasticity is consistent with its contrasting levels of seasonal abundance. Finally, in the context of global climate change in the Western Himalayas, D. nepalensis seems vulnerable in the warmer season due to lower adult as well as developmental acclimation potential at higher growth temperature (25°C). © 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={There is extensive evidence that fish from waters with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)-contaminated sediments accumulate PCBs and related chemicals and that people who eat fish from contaminated waters have higher body burdens of PCBs and PCB metabolites than those who do not. PCBs and their metabolites are potentially toxic; thus, it is important to human health to understand the uptake, biotransformation, and elimination of PCBs in fish since these processes determine the extent of accumulation. The intestinal uptake of PCBs present in the diet of fish into fish tissues is a process that is influenced by the lipid composition of the diet. Biotransformation of PCBs in fish, as in mammals, facilitates elimination, although many PCB congeners are recalcitrant to biotransformation in fish and mammals. Sequential biotransformation of PCBs by cytochrome P450 and conjugation pathways is even less efficient in fish than in mammalian species, thus contributing to the retention of PCBs in fish tissues. A very important factor influencing overall PCB disposition in fish is water temperature. Seasonal changes in water temperature produce adaptive physiological and biochemical changes in fish. While uptake of PCBs from the diet is similar in fish acclimated to winter or summer temperatures, there is evidence that elimination of PCBs occurs much more slowly when the fish is acclimated at low temperatures than at warmer temperatures. Research to date suggests that the processes of elimination of PCBs are modulated by several factors in fish including seasonal changes in water temperature. Thus, the body burden of PCBs in fish from a contaminated location is likely to vary with season. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Polar terrestrial invertebrates are suggested as being vulnerable to temperature change relative to lower latitude species, and hence possibly also to climate warming. Previous studies have shown Antarctic and Arctic Collembola and Acari to possess good heat tolerance and survive temperature exposures above 30 °C. To test this feature further, the heat tolerance and physiological plasticity of heat stress were explored in the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica, from Svalbard and the Antarctic midge, Eretmoptera murphyi, from Signy Island. The data obtained demonstrate considerable heat tolerance in both species, with upper lethal temperatures ≥35 °C (1 h exposures), and tolerance of exposure to 10 and 15 °C exceeding 56 days. This tolerance is far beyond that required in their current environment. Average microhabitat temperatures in August 2011 ranged between 5.1 and 8.1 °C, and rarely rose above 10 °C, in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. Summer soil microhabitat temperatures on Signy Island have previously been shown to range between 0 and 10 °C. There was also evidence to suggest that E. murphyi can recover from high-temperature exposure and that M. arctica is capable of rapid heat hardening. M. arctica and E. murphyi therefore have the physiological capacity to tolerate current environmental conditions, as well as future warming. If the features they express are characteristically more general, such polar terrestrial invertebrates will likely fare well under climate warming scenarios. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Among-population variation in chill-coma onset temperature (CTmin) is thought to reflect natural selection for local microclimatic conditions. However, few studies have investigated the evolutionary importance of cold tolerance limits in natural populations. Here, using a common-environment approach, we show pronounced variation in CTmin (± 4 °C) across the geographic range of a nonoverwintering crop pest, Eldana saccharina. The outcomes of this study provide two notable results in the context of evolved chill-coma variation: (1) CTmin differs significantly between geographic lines and is significantly positively correlated with local climates, and (2) there is a stable genetic architecture underlying CTmin trait variation, likely representing four key genes. Crosses between the most and least cold-tolerant geographic lines confirmed a genetic component to CTmin trait variation. Slower developmental time in the most cold-tolerant population suggests that local adaptation involves fitness costs; however, it confers fitness benefits in that environment. A significant reduction in phenotypic plasticity in the laboratory population suggests that plasticity of this trait is costly to maintain but also likely necessary for field survival. These results are significant for understanding field population adaption to novel environments, whereas further work is needed to dissect the underlying mechanism and gene(s) responsible. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Temperature plays a critical role in determining the biology of ectotherms. Many animals have evolved mechanisms that allow them to compensate biological rates, i.e. adjust biological rates to overcome thermodynamic effects. For low energy-organisms, such as bivalves, the costs of thermal compensation may be greater than the benefits, and thus prohibitive. To examine this, two experiments were designed to explore thermal compensation in Unio tumidus. Experiment 1 examined seasonal changes in behaviour in U. tumidus throughout a year. Temperature had a clear effect on burrowing rate with no evidence of compensation. Valve closure duration and frequency were also strongly affected by seasonal temperature change, but there was slight evidence of partial compensation. Experiment 2 examined oxygen consumption during burrowing, immediately following valve opening and at rest in summer (24. °C), autumn (14. °C), winter (4. °C), and spring (14. °C) acclimatized U. tumidus. Again, there was little evidence of burrowing rate compensation, but some evidence of partial compensation of valve closure duration and frequency. None of the oxygen compensation rates showed any evidence of thermal compensation. Thus, in general, there was only very limited evidence of thermal compensation of behaviour and no evidence of thermal compensation of oxygen compensation rates. Based upon this evidence, we argue that there is no evolutionary pressure for these bivalves to compensate these biological rates. Any pressure may be to maintain or even lower oxygen consumption as their only defence against predation is to close their valves and wait. An increase in oxygen consumption will be detrimental in this regard so the cost of thermal compensation may outweigh the benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Drosophila leontia is native to highly humid equatorial tropical habitats but its desiccation sensitivity (~10. h) is not consistent with its abundance during the drier autumn season in the subtropical regions. We have tested the effects of developmental acclimation on desiccation resistance and water balance related traits of D. leontia collected during rainy and autumn seasons. The isofemale lines of seasonal populations were reared under ecologically relevant growth temperatures (18 or 26. °C) or humidity conditions (35 or 85% RH) but tested at different times under identical experimental conditions. The larvae as well as flies reared under two thermal conditions (18 or 26. °C) showed no effect on desiccation related traits as well as storage and utilization of energy metabolites. In contrast, for D. leontia reared under low humidity (35% RH), significant changes at larval as well adult stages include increase in the desiccation resistance as well as cuticular lipid quantity, reduced levels of rate of body water loss, higher storage of carbohydrates but lower rate of utilization of carbohydrates as compared with flies reared at high humidity (85% RH). D. leontia has responded to rearing under low humidity conditions by increasing its desiccation resistance but not due to changes in the growth temperatures. These laboratory observations on seasonal populations highlight differences due to rearing conditions but not due to seasons. Further, direct analysis of wild-caught seasonal populations has shown trends similar to developmental acclimation effects. For wild caught flies, there are significant seasonal differences i.e. higher desiccation resistance as well as cuticular lipid quantity but reduced rate of water loss for autumn than rainy season flies. Thus, our laboratory observations are relevant for understanding seasonal adaptations of natural populations of tropical D. leontia to wet-dry conditions in the wild. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The physiological status of Cystoseira compressa, Padina pavonica and Palisada tenerrima was studied by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment content, stoichiometry (C:N), accumulation of UV photoprotectors and antioxidant activity; comparing their photosynthetic response in a coastal lagoon (Mar Menor) and in Mediterranean coastal waters. In general, the specimens reached their highest ETRmax in spring in the Lagoon, but in summer in the Mediterranean, coinciding with their maximum biomass peak. The species exhibited a dynamic photoinhibition. Except C. compressa, they showed a lower decrease in Fv/Fm and higher recovery rates in the Mediterranean populations when exposed to high irradiance. The higher salinity and temperature of the lagoon could impair the photoprotection mechanisms. The acclimation to lagoon environments is species-specific and involves complex regulatory mechanisms. The results underline the importance of N in repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms. In general, Lagoon specimens showed higher pigment concentration. Although xanthophylls play important photo-protective and antioxidant roles, the observed trend is more likely to be explained by the higher temperatures reached in the lagoon compared to Mediterranean. Therefore the studied photosynthetic and biochemical mechanisms can be effective not only for high irradiance, but also for higher temperatures in a climate change scenario, but are highly dependent on nutrient availability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Thermal acclimation responses in sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus were quantified by transfer and reciprocal transfer of fish between 11.1° and 18.2°C, between 18.2° and 25.7°C, or between 25.7°and 32.8°C. Changes in thermal acclimation status were assessed by posttransfer time series determinations of thermal tolerance (i.e., critical thermal minima and maxima). In general, heat tolerance gain and loss were complete in 20 and 25 d, respectively. Cold tolerance gain was achieved ca. 24 d posttransfer, but attrition was complete after only 12-13 d. Heat tolerance was gained asymmetrically, with fish acquiring approximately one-half of their accruable tolerance at the lowest transfer temperature. Likewise, the majority of cold tolerance accruement occurred during the warmest temperature transfer. Relatively uniform losses of heat and cold tolerance were seen in reciprocal transfers. Acclimation patterns were related to initial acclimation temperature, final acclimation temperature, and acclimation time and could be accurately modeled by multiple linear regression. The results suggest that sheepshead minnow accrue a majority of their highor low-temperature tolerance early in the acclimation process well before potential damaging temperatures are likely to occur. This novel pattern of asymmetric heat and cold tolerance acquisition in sheepshead minnow may be a key adaptation for surviving rapid and unpredictable water temperature changes commonly encountered in their natural environment. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Plasma lipid metabolites triglycerides (TRIG) and glycerol (GLY) are used as indicators of fattening rate and nutritional condition in migratory birds. Requiring only one blood sample, they could also be used for studying daily and seasonal fattening rates in relation with habitat quality or weather variations in species wintering in cold climates. Using black-capped chickadees exposed to three experimental temperatures (0. °C, 15. °C, and 30. °C), the goal of this experiment was to determine the relationship between plasma levels of TRIG and GLY and fattening rate measured over periods from a few hours to the previous two days. Results showed that birds maintained in the cold had metabolite levels 39-81% higher than those at thermoneutrality, likely reflecting the size of their fat reserves, and that TRIG and total GLY were highly correlated across treatments. Fattening rate was also higher at 0. °C (+. 35%) and 30. °C (+. 24%) relative to that measured at 15. °C and, as expected, was positively correlated with metabolite levels across treatments. However, despite fattening rates similar to that observed at the other temperatures, the relationships were uncoupled at 30. °C, implying that the technique may not be easily applicable at temperatures within or close to thermoneutrality. We also found a strong individual effect in the relationships between fattening rate and TRIG levels, suggesting high individual consistency in these parameters in conditions of unrestricted food access such as in captivity. Our study confirms that plasma TRIG and GLY levels can be used as relative indexes of condition and fattening rates in wintering passerines. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Tropical regions are expected to be some of the most affected by rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) because seasonal temperature variations are minimal. As temperatures rise, less oxygen dissolves in water, but metabolic requirements of fish and thus, the demand for effective oxygen uptake, increase. Gill remodelling is an acclimation strategy well documented in freshwater cyprinids experiencing large seasonal variations in temperature and oxygen as well as an amphibious killifish upon air exposure. However, no study has investigated whether tropical reef fishes remodel their gills to allow for increased oxygen demands at elevated temperatures. We tested for gill remodelling in five coral reef species (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Chromis atripectoralis, Pomacentrus moluccensis, Dascyllus melanurus and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus) from populations in northern Papua New Guinea (2° 35.765' S; 150° 46.193' E). Fishes were acclimated for 12-14days to 29 and 31°C (representing their seasonal range) and 33 and 34°C to account for end-of-century predicted temperatures. We measured lamellar perimeter, cross-sectional area, base thickness, and length for five filaments on the 2nd gill arches and qualitatively assessed 3rd gill arches via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All species exhibited significant differences in the quantitative measurements made on the lamellae, but no consistent trends with temperature were observed. SEM only revealed alterations in gill morphology in P. moluccensis. The overall lack of changes in gill morphology with increasing temperature suggests that these near-equatorial reef fishes may fail to maintain adequate O2 uptake under future climate scenarios unless other adaptive mechanisms are employed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Several Drosophila species originating from tropical humid localities are more resistant to starvation and heat stress than populations from high latitudes but mechanistic bases of such physiological changes are largely unknown. In order to test whether humidity levels affect starvation and heat resistance, we investigated developmental acclimation effects of low to high humidity conditions on the storage and utilization of energy resources, body mass, starvation survival, heat knockdown and heat survival of D. melanogaster. Isofemale lines reared under higher humidity (85% RH) stored significantly higher level of lipids and showed greater starvation survival hours but smaller in body size. In contrast, lines reared at low humidity evidenced reduced levels of body lipids and starvation resistance. Starvation resistance and lipid storage level were higher in females than males. However, the rate of utilization of lipids under starvation stress was lower for lines reared under higher humidity. Adult flies of lines reared at 65% RH and acclimated under high or low humidity condition for 200 hours also showed changes in resistance to starvation and heat but such effects were significantly lower as compared with developmental acclimation. Isofemale lines reared under higher humidity showed greater heat knockdown time and heat-shock survival. These laboratory observations on developmental and adult acclimation effects of low versus high humidity conditions have helped in explaining seasonal changes in resistance to starvation and heat of the wild-caught flies of D. melanogaster. Thus, we may suggest that wet versus drier conditions significantly affect starvation and heat resistance of D. melanogaster. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.},

abstract={Although the term environmental stress is used across multiple fields in biology, the inherent ambiguity associated with its definition has caused confusion when attempting to understand organismal responses to environmental change. Here I provide a brief summary of existing definitions of the term stress, and the related concepts of homeostasis and allostasis, and attempt to unify them to develop a general framework for understanding how organisms respond to environmental stressors. I suggest that viewing stressors as environmental changes that cause reductions in performance or fitness provides the broadest and most useful conception of the phenomenon of stress. I examine this framework in the context of animals that have evolved in highly variable environments, using the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, as a case study. Consistent with the extreme environmental variation that they experience in their salt marsh habitats, killifish have substantial capacity for both short-term resistance and long-term plasticity in the face of changing temperature, salinity and oxygenation. There is inter-population variation in the sensitivity of killifish to environmental stressors, and in their ability to acclimate, suggesting that local adaptation can shape the stress response even in organisms that are broadly tolerant and highly plastic. Whole-organism differences between populations in stressor sensitivity and phenotypic plasticity are reflected at the biochemical and molecular levels in killifish, emphasizing the integrative nature of the response to environmental stressors. Examination of this empirical example highlights the utility of using an evolutionary perspective on stressors, stress and stress responses. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={Cold-water fishes are becoming increasingly vulnerable as changing thermal conditions threaten their future sustainability. Thermal stress and habitat loss from increasing water temperatures are expected to impact population viability, particularly for inland populations with limited adaptive resources. Although the long-term persistence of cold-adapted species will depend on their ability to cope with and adapt to changing thermal conditions, very little is known about the scope and variation of thermal tolerance within and among conspecific populations and evolutionary lineages. We studied the upper thermal tolerance and capacity for acclimation in three captive populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from different ancestral thermal environments. Populations differed in their upper thermal tolerance and capacity for acclimation, consistent with their ancestry: the northernmost strain (Lake Nipigon) had the lowest thermal tolerance, while the strain with the most southern ancestry (Hill's Lake) had the highest thermal tolerance. Standard metabolic rate increased following caclimation to warm temperatures, but the response to acclimation varied among strains, suggesting that climatic warming may have differential effects across populations. Swimming performance varied among strains and among acclimation temperatures, but strains responded in a similar way to temperature acclimation. To explore potential physiological mechanisms underlying intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance, we quantified inducible and constitutive heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSC70, respectively). HSPs were associated with variation in thermal tolerance among strains and acclimation temperatures; HSP70 in cardiac and white muscle tissues exhibited similar patterns, whereas expression in hepatic tissue varied among acclimation temperatures but not strains. Taken together, these results suggest that populations of brook trout will vary in their ability to cope with a changing climate. © 2013 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many organisms have geographical distributions extending from the tropics to near polar regions or can experience up to 30°C temperature variation within the lifespan of an individual. Two forms of evolutionary adaptation to such wide ranges in ambient temperatures are frequently discussed: local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. The freshwater planktonic crustaceanDaphnia magna, whose range extends from South Africa to near arctic sites, shows strong phenotypic and genotypic variation in response to temperature. In this study, we use D. magna clones from 22 populations (one clone per population) ranging from latitude 0° (Kenya) to 66° North (White Sea) to explore the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation to high temperature tolerance. Temperature tolerance was studied as knockout time (time until immobilization, Timm) at 37°C in clones acclimatized to either 20°C or 28°C. Acclimatization to 28°C strongly increased Timm, testifying to adaptive phenotypic plasticity. At the same time, Timm significantly correlated with average high temperature at the clones' sites of origin, suggesting local adaptation. As earlier studies have found that haemoglobin expression contributes to temperature tolerance, we also quantified haemoglobin concentration in experimental animals and found that both acclimatization temperature (AccT) and temperature at the site of origin are positively correlated with haemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, Daphnia from warmer climates upregulate haemoglobin much more strongly in response to AccT, suggesting local adaptation for plasticity in haemoglobin expression. Our results show that both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to temperature tolerance, and elucidate a possible role of haemoglobin in mediating these effects that differs along a cold-warm gradient. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={Five winter oilseed rape cultivars (Benefit, Californium, Cortes, Ladoga, Navajo) were subjected to 30 days of cold treatment (4°C) to examine the effect of cold on acquired frost tolerance (FT), dehydrin (DHN) content, and photosynthesis-related parameters. The main aim of this study was to determine whether there are relationships between FT (expressed as LT50 values) and the other parameters measured in the cultivars. While the cultivar Benefit accumulated two types of DHNs (D45 and D35), the other cultivars accumulated three additional DHNs (D97, D47, and D37). The similar-sized DHNs (D45 and D47) were the most abundant; the others exhibited significantly lower accumulations. The highest correlations were detected between LT50 and DHN accumulation (r=-0.815), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi; r=-0.643), net photosynthetic rate (r=-0.628), stomatal conductance (r=0.511), and intracellular/intercellular CO2 concentration (r=0.505). Those cultivars that exhibited higher Pn rate in cold (and further a significant increase in WUEi) had higher levels of DHNs and also higher FT. No significant correlation was observed between LT50 and E, PRI, or NDVI. Overall, we have shown the selected physiological parameters to be able to distinguish different FT cultivars of winter oilseed rape. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={In the literature, frost hardiness (FH) studies in trees have often been restricted to one organ (buds, leaves, needles or twigs). To extend our knowledge and gain a unified view, FH differences between organs and tissues or throughout the life of the tree have to be characterized in relation to physiological changes. In this study, different organs and tissues of young potted and mature orchard walnut trees (Juglans regia L.) were compared for seasonal changes in FH during different years. FH was assessed using the electrolyte leakage method. Physiological parameters were concomitantly monitored focusing on two significant traits: water content (WC) and carbohydrate content (glucose+fructose+sucrose, GFS). No seasonal variation in FH was observed in the root system, but acclimation and deacclimation were observed aboveground. Among organs and tissues, cold sensitivity levels were different in deep winter, with buds most sensitive and bark most resistant, but acclimation/deacclimation dynamics followed similar patterns. Physiological variation was also similar among organs: FH increased when WC decreased and/or soluble carbohydrates increased. Based on these results, relations between soluble carbohydrate content, WC and FH were calculated independently or in interaction. The key results were that: (i) the relationship between FH and physiological parameters (GFS and WC), which had previously been shown for branches only, could be generalized to all aboveground organs; (ii) lower WC increased the cryoprotective effect of GFS, showing a synergic effect of the two factors; (iii) the best fit was a non-linear function of WC and GFS, yielding a predictive model with an root mean square error of 5.07°C on an independent dataset and 2.59°C for the most sensitive stages; and (iv) the same parameters used for all organs yielded a unified model of FH depending on physiology, although the variability of GFS or WC was wide. The model should be of value for predicting FH in walnut independently of previous growing conditions (i.e., after sublethal stress accumulation). © 2013 The Author.},

abstract={This study examined the molecular basis of energy-related regulatory mechanisms underlying metabolic recruitment of skeletal muscle during cold acclimation and possible involvement of the L-arginine/nitric oxide-producing pathway. Rats exposed to cold (4±1°C) for periods of 1, 3, 7, 12, 21 and 45 days were divided into three groups: untreated, L-arginine treated and Nω-nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treated. Compared with controls (22±1°C), there was an initial increase in the protein level of 5'- AMP-activated protein kinase a (day 1), followed by an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1a) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): PPARa and PPARγ from day 1 and PPARδ from day 7 of cold acclimation. Activation of the PGC-1α/PPAR transcription program was accompanied by increased protein expression of the key metabolic enzymes in β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, with the exceptions in complex I (no changes) and ATP synthase (decreased at day 1). Cold did not affect hexokinase and GAPDH protein levels, but increased lactate dehydrogenase activity compared with controls (1-45 days). L-arginine sustained, accelerated and/or intensified cold-induced molecular remodeling throughout cold acclimation. L-NAME exerted phase-dependent effects: similar to L-arginine in early cold acclimation and opposite after prolonged cold exposure (from day 21). It seems that upregulation of the PGC-1α/PPAR transcription program early during cold acclimation triggers the molecular recruitment of skeletal muscle underlying the shift to more oxidative metabolism during prolonged cold acclimation. Our results suggest that nitric oxide has a role in maintaining the skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype in late cold acclimation but question its role early in cold acclimation. © 2013.

abstract={We studied polar and temperate samples of the lichen Cetraria aculeata to investigate whether genetical differences between photobionts are correlated with physiological properties of the lichen holobiont. Net photosynthesis and dark respiration (DR) at different temperatures (from 0 to 30 °C) and photon flux densities (from 0 to 1,200 μmol m-2 s-1) were studied for four populations of Cetraria aculeata. Samples were collected from maritime Antarctica, Svalbard, Germany and Spain, representing different climatic situations. Sequencing of the photobiont showed that the investigated samples fall in the polar and temperate clade described in Fernández-Mendoza et al. (Mol Ecol 20:1208-1232, 2011). Lichens with photobionts from these clades differ in their temperature optimum for photosynthesis, maximal net photosynthesis, maximal DR and chlorophyll content. Maximal net photosynthesis was much lower in Antarctica and Svalbard than in Germany and Spain. The difference was smaller when rates were expressed by chlorophyll content. The same is true for the temperature optima of polar (11 °C) and temperate (15 and 17 °C) lichens. Our results indicate that lichen mycobionts may adapt or acclimate to local environmental conditions either by selecting algae from regional pools or by regulating algal cell numbers (chlorophyll content) within the thallus. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Increased atmospheric pCO2 is expected to render future oceans warmer and more acidic than they are at present. Calcifying organisms such as coccolithophores that fix and export carbon into the deep sea provide feedbacks to increasing atmospheric pCO2. Acclimation experiments suggest negative effects of warming and acidification on coccolithophore calcification, but the ability of these organisms to adapt to future environmental conditions is not well understood. Here,we tested the combined effect of pCO2 and temperature on the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi over more than 700 generations. Cells increased inorganic carbon content and calcification rate under warm and acidified conditions compared with ambient conditions, whereas organic carbon content and primary production did not show any change. In contrast to findings from short-term experiments, our results suggest that long-term acclimation or adaptation could change, or even reverse, negative calcification responses in E. huxleyi and its feedback to the global carbon cycle. Genomewide profiles of gene expression using RNA-seq revealed that genes thought to be essential for calcification are not those that are most strongly differentially expressed under long-term exposure to future ocean conditions. Rather, differentially expressed genes observed here represent new targets to study responses to ocean acidification and warming. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Warming of sea surface temperatures and alteration of ocean chemistry associated with anthropogenic increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide will have profound consequences for a broad range of species, but the potential for seasonal variation to modify species and ecosystem responses to these stressors has received little attention. Here, using the longest experiment to date (542 days), we investigate how the interactive effects of warming and ocean acidification affect the growth, behaviour and associated levels of ecosystem functioning (nutrient release) for a functionally important non-calcifying intertidal polychaete (Alitta virens) under seasonally changing conditions.We find that the effects of warming, ocean acidification and their interactions are not detectable in the short term, but manifest over time through changes in growth, bioturbation and bioirrigation behaviour that, in turn, affect nutrient generation. These changes are intimately linked to species responses to seasonal variations in environmental conditions (temperature and photoperiod) that, depending upon timing, can either exacerbate or buffer the long-term directional effects of climatic forcing. Taken together, our observations caution against over emphasizing the conclusions from short-term experiments and highlight the necessity to consider the temporal expression of complex system dynamics established over appropriate timescales when forecasting the likely ecological consequences of climatic forcing. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Ocean acidification and greenhouse warming will interactively influence competitive success of key phytoplankton groups such as diatoms, but how long-term responses to global change will affect community structure is unknown. We incubated a mixed natural diatom community from coastal New Zealand waters in a short-term (two-week) incubation experiment using a factorial matrix of warming and/or elevated pCO2 and measured effects on community structure. We then isolated the dominant diatoms in clonal cultures and conditioned them for 1 year under the same temperature and pCO2 conditions from which they were isolated, in order to allow for extended selection or acclimation by these abiotic environmental change factors in the absence of interspecific interactions. These conditioned isolates were then recombined into 'artificial' communities modelled after the original natural assemblage and allowed to compete under conditions identical to those in the short-term natural community experiment. In general, the resulting structure of both the unconditioned natural community and conditioned 'artificial' community experiments was similar, despite differences such as the loss of two species in the latter. pCO2 and temperature had both individual and interactive effects on community structure, but temperature was more influential, as warming significantly reduced species richness. In this case, our short-term manipulative experiment with a mixed natural assemblage spanning weeks served as a reasonable proxy to predict the effects of global change forcing on diatom community structure after the component species were conditioned in isolation over an extended timescale. Future studies will be required to assess whether or not this is also the case for other types of algal communities from other marine regimes. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Development of ectotherms is highly temperature dependent. Studies using variable thermal environments can improve ecological relevance of data because organisms naturally face day-to-day stochastic temperature fluctuations as well as seasonal changes in the amplitude of such daily fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate if, and to what extent, the use of constant temperatures is justified in studies of the model species, yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria (L.). We examined the effect of temperature fluctuation on the expression of several life history traits and the effect on subsequent adult longevity. We used two fluctuating temperature treatments with the same mean but different amplitudes (15/21°C, 12/24°C; 12/12 h), and three constant temperature treatments spanning the wide temperature range faced in the wild (12, 18, and 24°C). Large temperature fluctuation was mostly detrimental (lower juvenile survival, slower growth, smaller body size, and longer development), whereas moderate temperature fluctuation usually gave responses similar to the constant regime. When developing in fluctuating temperatures, adult longevity (no effect), body size (lower), and wing shape (narrower wings) deviated from the expectations based on the constant temperature reaction norms, presumably because of acclimation responses. Contrary to some studies no obvious beneficial effects of moderate temperature fluctuation were observed. Instead, yellow dung flies seem to canalize development in the face of temperature fluctuation up to a point when detrimental effects become unavoidable. The relatively greater effects of extreme constant developmental temperatures question their biological relevance in experiments. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={There is increasing interest in comparing species of related organisms for their susceptibility to thermal extremes in order to evaluate potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparisons are typically undertaken on individuals collected from the field with or without a period of acclimation. However, this approach does not allow the potential contributions of environmental and carry-over effects across generations to be separated from inherent species differences in susceptibility. To assess the importance of these different sources of variation, we here considered heat and cold resistance in Drosophilid species from tropical and temperate sites in the field and across two laboratory generations. Resistance in field-collected individuals tended to be lower when compared with F1 and F2 laboratory generations, and species differences in field flies were only weakly correlated to differences established under controlled rearing conditions, unlike in F1-F2 comparisons. This reflected large environmental effects on resistance associated with different sites and conditions experienced within sites. For the 8 h cold recovery assay there was no strong evidence of carry-over effects, whereas for the heat knockdown and 2 h cold recovery assays there was some evidence for such effects. However, for heat these were species specific in direction. Variance components for inherent species differences were substantial for resistance to heat and 8 h cold stress, but small for 2 h cold stress, though this may be a reflection of the species being considered in the comparisons. These findings highlight that inherent differences among species are difficult to characterise accurately without controlling for environmental sources of variation and carry-over effects. Moreover, they also emphasise the complex nature of carry-over effects that vary depending on the nature of stress traits and the species being evaluated. © 2013.

This study sought to determine whether fine-root (&lt;1 mm) respiration in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)-dominated northern hardwood forest would adjust to experimentally warmed soil, reducing C return to the atmosphere at the ecosystem scale to levels lower than that would be expected using an exponential temperature response function. Infrared heating lamps were used to warm the soil (+4 to +5 °C) in a mature sugar maple forest in a fully factorial design, including water additions used to offset the effects of warming-induced dry soil. Fine-root-specific respiration rates, root biomass, root nitrogen (N) concentration, soil temperature and soil moisture were measured from 2009 to 2011, with experimental treatments conducted from late 2010 to 2011. Partial acclimation of fine-root respiration to soil warming occurred, with soil moisture deficit further constraining specific respiration rates in heated plots. Fine-root biomass and N concentration remained unchanged. Over the 2011 growing season, ecosystem root respiration was not significantly greater in warmed soil. This result would not be predicted by models that allow respiration to increase exponentially with temperature and do not directly reduce root respiration in drier soil. © 2013 The Author 2013.},

abstract={Plants show flexible acclimation of leaf photosynthesis to temperature that depends both on their prevailing growth environment and the climate where they originated. This acclimation has been shown to involve changes in the temperature responses of the apparent maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax) and apparent maximum rate of electron transport (J max), as well as changes in the ratio of these parameters. We asked whether such changes in photosynthetic biochemistry attributable to climate of origin are similar in nature and magnitude to those attributable to growth environment. To address this question, we measured temperature responses of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence on six Eucalyptus species from diverse geographical and climatic regions growing in a common garden. Measurements were made in three seasons, allowing us to compare interspecific differences with seasonal changes. We found significant interspecific differences in apparent Vcmax and Jmaxstandardized to 25 °C, but there were no significant differences in the temperature responses of these parameters among species. Comparing data across seasons, we found significant seasonal changes in apparent Vcmax25, but not in J max25, causing a change in their ratio (J/V ratio). However, there were no seasonal changes in the temperature response of either parameter. We concluded that the growth environment had a much larger effect on temperature response than climate of origin among this set of species. Mean daytime temperature increased by 15 °C from winter to summer, whereas we esti-mated that the seasonal change in J/V ratio would cause a change in the optimum temperature (Topt) for gross photosynthesis of 3.6 °C. Use of a general relationship to describe photosynthetic temperature acclimation resulted in a strong underestimation of the Topt for photosynthesis for these species. Our results indicated that variation in photosynthetic temperature responses cannot be captured in one simple relationship with growth temperature. Further comparative research on species groups will be needed to develop a basis for modelling these interspecific differences in plant temperature acclimation. © The Author 2013.

abstract={We tested whether snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) trees growing in thermally contrasting environments exhibit generalizable temperature (T) response functions of leaf respiration (R) and fluorescence (Fo). Measurements were made on pot-grown saplings and field-grown trees (growing between 1380 and 2110m a.s.l.). Using a continuous, high-resolution protocol, we quantified T response curves of R and Fo - these data were used to identify an algorithm for modelling R-T curves at subcritical T's and establish variations in heat tolerance. For the latter, we quantified Tmax [T where R is maximal] and Tcrit [T where Fo rises rapidly]. Tmax ranged from 51 to 57°C, varying with season (e.g. winter&gt;summer). Tcrit ranged from 41 to 49°C in summer and from 58 to 63°C in winter. Thus, surprisingly, leaf energy metabolism was more heat-tolerant in trees experiencing ice-encasement in winter than warmer conditions in summer. A polynomial model fitted to log-transformed R data provided the best description of the T-sensitivity of R (between 10 and 45°C); using these model fits, we found that the negative slope of the Q10-T relationship was greater in winter than in summer. Collectively, our results (1) highlight high-T limits of energy metabolism in E.pauciflora and (2) provide a framework for improving representation of T-responses of leaf R in predictive models. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The ability to increase freezing tolerance when exposed to low temperatures is a property of many plant species from temperate climates and involves a wide array of metabolic adjustments and changes in gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana, natural accessions show high variation in their acclimation capacity, and freezing tolerance correlates with natural habitat temperatures. To investigate the genetic basis of this variation, a recombinant inbred line population from reciprocal crosses between the accessions C24 and Tenela (Te), showing large variation in tolerance, was established. Over 250 recombinant inbred lines were genotyped for 69 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in a linkage map with 391.9 centimorgans (cM) and phenotyped for their freezing tolerance using the electrolyte leakage method that reports cell damage after a freeze-thaw cycle. Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for acclimated plants revealed three QTL regions on chromosomes 2, 4 and 5. Based on gene expression data, QTL regions were screened for genes differentially responding to low temperature in C24 and Te. Among the candidate genes, the Myb family transcription factor REVEILLE1 (At5g17300) on chromosome 5 was identified as a novel negative regulator of freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The ability to rapidly respond to changes in temperature is a critical adaptation for insects and other ectotherms living in thermally variable environments. In a process called rapid cold hardening (RCH), insects significantly enhance cold tolerance following brief (i.e., minutes to hours) exposure to nonlethal chilling. Although the ecological relevance of RCH is well-established, the underlying physiological mechanisms that trigger RCH are poorly understood. RCH can be elicited in isolated tissues ex vivo, suggesting coldsensing and downstream hardening pathways are governed by brain-independent signaling mechanisms. We previously provided preliminary evidence that calcium is involved in RCH, and here we firmly establish that calcium signaling mediates cold sensing in insect tissues. In tracheal cells of the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis, chilling to 0 °C evoked a 40% increase in intracellular calcium concentration as determined by live-cell confocal imaging. Downstream of calcium entry, RCH conditions significantly increased the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) while reducing phosphorylation of the inhibitory Thr306 residue. Pharmacological inhibitors of calcium entry, calmodulin activation, and CaMKII activity all prevented ex vivo RCH in midgut and salivary gland tissues, indicating that calcium signaling is required for RCH to occur. Similar results were obtained for a freeze-intolerant species, adults of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, suggesting that calcium-mediated cold sensing is a general feature of insects. Our results imply that insect tissues use calcium signaling to instantly detect decreases in temperature and trigger downstream cold-hardening mechanisms.},

abstract={Drosophila ananassae has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of D. ananassae in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000-2010). We document invasion of D. ananassae to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of D. ananassae to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low versus high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of D. ananassae. © 2013.

abstract={Given the threat of climate change towards scleractinian corals, there is an urgent need to understand their physiological mechanisms of acclimation to increasing temperatures. To gain insight into this process, two mesocosm-based experiments were conducted in Southern Taiwan with the model reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis. In the first study, temperature was gradually elevated to 32 °C, though reduced to ambient levels at night, in order to simulate a temperature profile that can characterize intertidal reefs of Southern Taiwan. All corals acclimated to such conditions over the course of the month-long experiment, as evidenced by a variety of physiological and sub-cellular responses. In the second experiment, corals were exposed continually to 31.5 °C for two weeks, and, in contrast to results from the first study, the majority of the corals died, revealing that prolonged exposure to this temperature is lethal for this dominant reef builder of many regions of the Pacific Ocean. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The cunner is a marine teleost that exhibits winter dormancy (i.e., becomes inactive and stops feeding) when seawater temperatures fall below 5°C. To examine whether this dormant state is also associated with active metabolic depression, the effect of season on routine metabolic rate (MRrout) was measured at five different times throughout the year: early spring (5°C), late spring (9°C), summer (14°C), late fall (5°C), and winter (0°C). In addition, cardiac function (cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume) was measured at the last three measurement time points, and the ability of fall- and winteracclimated cunner to adjust MRrout and cardiac function when challenged with acute temperature changes was assessed. The cunner actively depressed MRrout between fall and winter as temperature fell from 5° to 0°C (Q10 =10.4). In addition, MRrout showed a substantial but smaller Q10 (4.3) when the MRrout at 0°C (winter) was compared with the value recorded during the previous spring at ~5°C. These seasonal changes were essentially mirrored by the response of MRrout to acute 5°C increases and decreases in temperature. Similar to MRrout, cardiac output (Q) decreased dramatically as temperature fell from 5°C (fall) to 0°C (winter) in the seasonal study (Q10 = 7.9) and increased substantially when temperature was acutely increased from 0° to 5°C (Q ~ 5). However, when subjected 10 to an acute temperature decrease (from 5° to 0°C), the Q10 for Q was only approximately 2-3. These results show that (1) cunner actively depress their metabolism in the fall and winter and that this is associated with a large decrease in cardiac function and (2) there is a decoupling between Q and MRrout when 5°C seasonally acclimated cunner are exposed to an acute temperature decrease to 0°C. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Incorporation of global climate change (GCC) effects into assessments of chemical risk and injury requires integrated examinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors. Environmental variables altered by GCC (temperature, precipitation, salinity, pH) can influence the toxicokinetics of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as toxicodynamic interactions between chemicals and target molecules. In addition, GCC challenges processes critical for coping with the external environment (water balance, thermoregulation, nutrition, and the immune, endocrine, and neurological systems), leaving organisms sensitive to even slight perturbations by chemicals when pushed to the limits of their physiological tolerance range. In simplest terms, GCC can make organisms more sensitive to chemical stressors, while alternatively, exposure to chemicals can make organisms more sensitive to GCC stressors. One challenge is to identify potential interactions between nonchemical and chemical stressors affecting key physiological processes in an organism. We employed adverse outcome pathways, constructs depicting linkages between mechanism-based molecular initiating events and impacts on individuals or populations, to assess how chemical- and climate-specific variables interact to lead to adverse outcomes. Case examples are presented for prospective scenarios, hypothesizing potential chemical-GCC interactions, and retrospective scenarios, proposing mechanisms for demonstrated chemical-climate interactions in natural populations. Understanding GCC interactions along adverse outcome pathways facilitates extrapolation between species or other levels of organization, development of hypotheses and focal areas for further research, and improved inputs for risk and resource injury assessments. © 2012 SETAC.},

abstract={Freezing injury is a major factor limiting the geographical distribution of plant species and the growth and yield of crop plants. Plants from temperate climates are able to increase their freezing tolerance during exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures in a process termed cold acclimation. Damage to cellular membranes is the major cause of freezing injury in plants, and membrane lipid composition is strongly modified during cold acclimation. Forward and reverse genetic approaches have been used to probe the role of specific lipid-modifying enzymes in the freezing tolerance of plants. In the present paper we describe an alternative ecological genomics approach that relies on the natural genetic variation within a species. Arabidopsis thaliana has a wide geographical range throughout the Northern Hemisphere with significant natural variation in freezing tolerance that was used for a comparative analysis of the lipidomes of 15 Arabidopsis accessions using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Fourier-transformmass spectrometry, allowing the detection of 180 lipid species. After 14 days of cold acclimation at 4°C the plants from most accessions had accumulated massive amounts of storage lipids, with most of the changes in long-chain unsaturated triacylglycerides, while the total amount of membrane lipids was only slightly changed. Nevertheless, major changes in the relative amounts of different membrane lipids were also evident. The relative abundance of several lipid species was highly correlated with the freezing tolerance of the accessions, allowing the identification of possible marker lipids for plant freezing tolerance. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In northern Canada, lake chub (Cyprinidae: Couesius plumbeus) have colonized a variety of thermal springs that differ substantially from the ancestral environment in both mean temperature and thermal variation. To examine whether this environmental change is associated with differences in physiological traits, we compared the thermal breadth, capacity for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and metabolic enzymes in populations of lake chub from three habitats: a warm but variable hot spring, a thermally constant warm spring, and a seasonally variable temperate lake. Thermal breadth was generally lowest in fish from the constant environment, and this difference was statistically significant in fish acclimated at 10° and 25°C. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) increased with increasing acclimation temperature in all populations. CTmax was similar among populations when acclimated at high temperatures but greater in the variable-spring population acclimated to low temperature (10°C). Critical thermal minimum was also dependent on acclimation temperature in all populations but differed among populations such that fish from the stable-spring habitat were not as tolerant to cold temperature when acclimated to 25°C. Temperate- and variable-spring populations showed an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities (citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase) with decreasing acclimation temperature, but this response was absent in the stable-temperature population. Protein content did not change with acclimation temperature in the stable-temper- ature population, while it increased with decreasing acclimation temperature in both variable thermal habitat populations. Our study suggests that interpopulation variation in thermal physiology is associated with habitat thermal variability. © 2012 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the context of climate change, there is a sustained interest in understanding better the functional mechanisms by which marine ectotherms maintain their physiological scope and define their ability to cope with thermal changes in their environment. Here, we present evidence that the variable shrimp Palaemonetes varians shows genuine acclimation capacities of both the thermal limit (CTmax) and the heat shock response (hsp70 induction temperature). During cold acclimation to 10 °C, the time lag to adjust the stress gene expression to the current environmental temperature proved to exceed 1 week, thereby highlighting the importance of long-term experiments in evaluating the species' acclimation capacities. Cold and warm-acclimated specimens of P. varians can mobilise the heat shock response (HSR) at temperatures above those experienced in nature, which suggests that the species is potentially capable of expanding its upper thermal range. The shrimp also survived acute heat shock well above its thermal limit without subsequent induction of the HSR, which is discussed with regard to thermal adaptations required for life in highly variable environments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Many plants, including Arabidopsis, exhibit increased freezing tolerance after cold exposure (cold acclimation). Here we present evidence for geographical clines (both latitudinal and longitudinal) in acclimated (ACC) and non-acclimated (NA) freezing tolerance, estimated from electrolyte leakage measurements on 54 accessions. Leaf Pro contents were not correlated with freezing tolerance, while sugar contents (Glc, Fru, Suc, Raf) were in the ACC, but not the NA state. Expression levels of 14 cold-induced genes were investigated before and after 2 weeks of cold acclimation by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of the CBF1, 2 and 3 genes was not correlated with freezing tolerance. The expression of some CBF-regulated (COR) genes, however, was correlated specifically with ACC freezing tolerance. A tight correlation between CBF and COR gene expression was only observed under non-acclimating conditions, where CBF and COR expression were also correlated with the expression of PRR5, a component of the circadian clock. Collectively, this study sheds new light on the molecular determinants of plant-freezing tolerance and cold acclimation and their geographical dependence.

abstract={Low temperature plays a crucial role in seasonal development of woody plants and may directly impact crop production, more particularly in temperate fruit trees. Given its high genetic variability and adaptability to different climatic conditions, almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) is an interesting model to understand the mechanisms regulating low temperature sensing in fruit trees. In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of two genes (PdCBF1 and PdCBF2) belonging to the C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) family of transcription factors. Southern blotting analysis showed that this family is composed of at least five members. In almond shoots propagated in vitro, transcription of these genes was rapidly induced by low temperature, suggesting an involvement in cold acclimation. Transactivation assays showed that PdCBF1 and PdCBF2 could bind to dehydration responsive element/C-repeat containing sequences, as activators of gene expression. In addition, induction of both PdCBFs by cold was higher towards the end of the day, which agreed with the expression pattern of PdDehydrin1, a predicted CBF target gene. Furthermore, PdCBF1 and PdCBF2 were also transiently induced by abscisic acid and drought treatments. Considering the bin mapping analysis that correlated PdCBFs and PdDHN1 (respectively in linkage groups 5 and 7) with two different quantitative trait locicontrolling blooming time, it is relevant to perform further association studies that may validate their effect on this trait. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={The effect of temperature and irradiance during growth on photosynthetic traits of two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. Plants were grown at 10 and 22 °C, and at 50 and 300 μmol photons m-2 s-1 in a factorial design. As known from other cold-tolerant herbaceous species, growth of Arabidopsis at low temperature resulted in increases in photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area and chlorophyll. Growth at high irradiance had a similar effect. However, the growth temperature and irradiance showed interacting effects for several capacity-related variables. Temperature effects on the ratio between electron transport capacity and carboxylation capacity were also different in low compared to high irradiance grown Arabidopsis. The carboxylation capacity per unit Rubisco, a measure for the in vivo Rubisco activity, was low in low irradiance grown plants but there was no clear growth temperature effect. The limitation of photosynthesis by the utilization of triose-phosphate in high temperature grown plants was less when grown at low compared to high irradiance. Several of these traits contribute to reduced efficiency of the utilization of resources for photosynthesis of Arabidopsis at low irradiance. The two accessions from contrasting climates showed remarkably similar capabilities of developmental acclimation to the two environmental factors. Hence, no evidence was found for photosynthetic adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to specific climatic conditions. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Thellungiella has been proposed as an extremophile alternative to Arabidopsis to investigate environmental stress tolerance. However, Arabidopsis accessions show large natural variation in their freezing tolerance and here the tolerance ranges of collections of accessions in the two species were compared.Results: Leaf freezing tolerance of 16 Thellungiella accessions was assessed with an electrolyte leakage assay before and after 14 days of cold acclimation at 4°C. Soluble sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose) and free polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) were quantified by HPLC, proline photometrically. The ranges in nonacclimated freezing tolerance completely overlapped between Arabidopsis and Thellungiella. After cold acclimation, some Thellungiella accessions were more freezing tolerant than any Arabidopsis accessions. Acclimated freezing tolerance was correlated with sucrose levels in both species, but raffinose accumulation was lower in Thellungiella and only correlated with freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. The reverse was true for leaf proline contents. Polyamine levels were generally similar between the species. Only spermine content was higher in nonacclimated Thellungiella plants, but decreased during acclimation and was negatively correlated with freezing tolerance.Conclusion: Thellungiella is not an extremophile with regard to freezing tolerance, but some accessions significantly expand the range present in Arabidopsis. The metabolite data indicate different metabolic adaptation strategies between the species. © 2012 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Walking speeds were calculated for nine clones of the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae collected from three countries along a latitudinal cline of its European distribution from Sweden to Spain (Sweden, UK and Spain), and the effects of collection origin and intra and intergenerational acclimation were investigated. Walking speeds declined with decreasing temperature, with maximum performance at temperatures closest to acclimation temperature (fastest median walking speed of 5.8 cm min-1 was recorded for clone UK 3, collected from the UK, at 25°C after acclimating to 25°C for one generation). Following acclimation at both 20°C and 25°C, walking ceased (as indicated by median walking speeds of 0.0 cm min-1) at temperatures as high as 7.5°C and 12.5°C. However, acclimation at 10°C enabled mobility to occur to temperatures as low as 0°C. There was no relationship between mobility and latitude of collection, suggesting that large scale mixing of aphids may occur across Europe. However, clonal variation was suggested, with clone UK 3 outperforming the majority of other clones across all temperatures at which mobility was maintained following acclimation at 10°C for one and three generations and at 25°C for one generation. The Scandinavian clones consistently outperformed their temperate and Mediterranean counterparts at the majority of temperatures following acclimation for three generations at 25°C. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Genetic prerequisites for the evolution of sexual dimorphism, sex-specific heritabilities and low or negative genetic correlations between homologous traits in males and females are rarely found. However, sexual dimorphism is evolving rapidly following environmental change, suggesting that sexual dimorphism and its genetic background could be environmentally sensitive. Yet few studies have explored the sensitivity of the genetic background of sexual dimorphism on environmental variation. In this study, on Drosophila melanogaster, we used a large nested full-sib-half-sib breeding design where families were split into four different developmental temperatures: two constant temperature treatments of 25 and 30°C and two cycling temperatures with means of 25 and 30°C, respectively. After emergence, we tested heat shock tolerance of adult flies. We found that sexual dimorphism was strongly affected by temperature during development. Moreover, we found that female heritability was significantly lower in flies developing at hot temperature and more so under hot and cycling temperatures. Interestingly, most of the genetic variation for heat shock tolerance was orthogonal (i.e. noncorrelated) between sexes, allowing independent evolution of heat shock tolerance in males and females. These findings give support to the hypothesis that the evolution of sexual dimorphism can be influenced by the environments experienced during development. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Global change challenges forest adaptability at the distributional limit of species. We studied ring-porous Quercus canariensis Willd. xylem traits to analyze how they adjust to spatio-temporal variability in climate. Trees were sampled along altitudinal transects, and annual time series of radial growth (ring width (RW)) and several earlywood vessel (EV) traits were built to analyze their relationships with climate. The trees responded to increasing water constraints with decreasing altitude and changes in climate in the short term but the analyses showed that xylem did not acclimate in response to long-term temperature increase during the past 30 years. The plants' adjustment to climate variability was expressed in a different but complementary manner by the different xylem traits. At low elevations, trees exhibited higher correlations with water stress indices and trees acclimated to more xeric conditions at low elevations by reducing radial growth and hydraulic diameter (DH) but increasing the density of vessels (DV). Average potential conductivity (KH) was similar for trees at different altitudes. However, inter-tree differences in xylem traits were higher than those between altitudes, suggesting a strong influence of individual genetic features or micro-site conditions. Trees exhibited higher RW those years with larger DH and particularly the linear density of vessels (DVl), but partly, climatic signals expressed in RW differed from those in EVs. Trees produced larger DH after cold winters and wet years. Ring width responded positively to wet and cool weather in fall and spring, whereas the response to climate of DV and KH was generally opposite to that of RW. These relationships likely expressed the negative impact of high respiration rates in winter on the carbon pools used to produce the EVs in the next spring and the overall positive influence of water availability for trees. Our results showed that trees at different sites were able to adjust their hydraulic architecture to climatic variability and temperature increase during recent decades coordinating several complementary traits. Nonetheless, it should be monitored whether they will succeed to acclimate to future climatic scenarios of increasing water stress. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={The California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska (USA) to Baja California (Mexico) along the west coast of North America. Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33° of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={In nature, many organisms alter their developmental trajectory in response to environmental variation. However, studies of thermal acclimation have historically involved stable, unrealistic thermal treatments. In our study, we incorporated ecologically relevant treatments to examine the effects of environmental stochasticity on the thermal acclimation of the fall field cricket (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). We raised crickets for 5 weeks at either a constant temperature (25°C) or at one of three thermal regimes mimicking a seasonal decline in temperature (from 25 to 12°C). The latter three treatments differed in their level of thermal stochasticity: crickets experienced either no diel cycle, a predictable diel cycle, or an unpredictable diel cycle. Following these treatments, we measured several traits considered relevant to survival or reproduction, including growth rate, jumping velocity, feeding rate, metabolic rate, and cold tolerance. Contrary to our predictions, the acclimatory responses of crickets were unrelated to the magnitude or type of thermal variation. Furthermore, acclimation of performance was not ubiquitous among traits. We recommend additional studies of acclimation in fluctuating environments to assess the generality of these findings. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Exotic invasion is considered as the second factor influencing biodiversity after habitat lose. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides Griseb.), a perennial herb native to the South America, has established itself on almost all the surface of the earth except Africa. In China, alligator weed has invaded most temperate regions where the environmental conditions, particularly temperature, are obviously different from its origin. How can alligator weed survive through cold winters is a critical issue for its establishment in these areas. In this research, we investigated the seasonal change of soluble sugars content (SSC), which presented important physiological reaction to cold acclimation, in different parts including buds, nodes, and internodes of alligator weed from aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Results showed that accumulation of soluble sugars was regularly correlated to temperature change in environment, i.e., the highest SSC in the coldest season, and the lowest in summer. Among different parts such as nodes, buds and internodes in individuals from terrestrial and aquatic habitats, accumulation of SSC presented similar results. The accumulation of SSC and its seasonal dynamics may be a physiological acclimation to low temperature so that alligator weed could establish in these regions and survive through cold winters ecologically.},

The SCP of adults decreased significantly from October (median = -13.8°C) to January (median = -20.7°C) in first year, relatively similar results was observed in the second year. The lowest LT50 was observed in overwintering adults collected in January (-16.81°C) in the first year and December (-15.59°C) in the second year. Mortality at -15°C for 24 h was >70% in early autumn in both years whereas it decreased to lower than 45% in early winter, the highest mortality (100%) was observed in adults collected in May in both years. Cold acclimated adults (30 d, 5°C) in November 2008 exhibited significantly higher SCP ( -12.21 ± 0.64°C) than nonacclimated adults (-15.57 ± 1.35°C). A 30-d exposure to 5°C caused >20% mortality in November, while <9% mortality was observed in adults collected in December and January 2008. Overwintering adults died upon freezing and the lower lethal temperatures were within the range of SCP, indicating that X. luteola is a freeze intolerant insect. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={There is interest in discovering root traits associated with acclimation to nutrient stress. Large root systems, such as in adult maize, have proven difficult to be phenotyped comprehensively and over time, causing target traits to be missed. These challenges were overcome here using aeroponics, a system where roots grow in the air misted with a nutrient solution. Applying an agriculturally relevant degree of low nitrogen (LN) stress, 30-day-old plants responded by increasing lengths of individual crown roots (CRs) by 63%, compensated by a 40% decline in CR number. LN increased the CR elongation rate rather than lengthening the duration of CR growth. Only younger CR were significantly responsive to LN stress, a novel finding. LN shifted the root system architectural balance, increasing the lateral root (LR)-to-CR ratio, adding ∼70m to LR length. LN caused a dramatic increase in second-order LR density, not previously reported in adult maize. Despite the near-uniform aeroponics environment, LN induced increased variation in the relative lengths of opposing LR pairs. Large-scale analysis of root hairs (RHs) showed that LN decreased RH length and density. Time-course experiments suggested the RH responses may be indirect consequences of decreased biomass/demand under LN. These results identify novel root traits for genetic dissection. The fine-scale effects of low nitrogen stress on adult-stage maize roots has not been fully characterized. Aeroponics, a system where roots grow in the air misted with a nutrient solution, was used for this analysis. The results show that low nitrogen impacts the adult maize root system at all scales of development including crown roots, first and second order lateral roots and root hairs, identifying novel traits for genetic dissection. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabit salt marshes and estuaries along the eastern coast of North America from Newfoundland to northern Florida, and are thus exposed to a large range of temperatures. Previous studies have shown higher whole-organism metabolic rates in the northern subspecies (F. h. macrolepidotus) compared with the southern subspecies (F. h. heteroclitus) of these fish. Here, we examine phenotypic plasticity in the response to cold temperatures between the two subspecies by acclimating fish to 5, 15 and 25°C and comparing several mitochondrial and muscle properties. The relative area of oxidative muscle versus glycolytic muscle fibers was greater in the northern subspecies at the 5 and 15°C acclimation temperatures. However, there were no differences in capillary density between the two subspecies or at different temperatures. Mitochondrial volume and surface densities increased in response to cold temperature acclimation in red and white muscle, but only in the northern killifish. Citrate synthase activities also increased in the northern killifish at 5 and 15°C. The ratio of calculated [free ADP] to [ATP] increased in the 5°C acclimated southern killifish but not in the northern killifish at 5°C when compared with the 15°C acclimation group, suggesting that there are differences in adenylate signaling for mitochondrial respiration between subspecies at low temperature. Taken together, our data indicate that the northern subspecies have a greater ability to increase mitochondrial capacity at colder temperatures compared with the southern subspecies, providing one of the few examples of intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity in mitochondrial amount in response to cold temperatures. © 2011.

Their thermal resistance levels are determined by inherent and plastic mechanisms, which are both likely to be under selection in natural populations. Previous studies on Drosophila species have shown that inherent resistance is highly species specific, and differs among ecotypes (e.g., tropical and widespread species). Apart from being exposed to thermal stress many small and fragmented populations face genetic challenges due to, for example, inbreeding. Inbreeding has been shown to reduce inherent resistance levels toward stressful temperatures, but whether adaptation to thermal stress through plastic responses also is affected by inbreeding is so far not clear. In this study, we test inherent cold resistance and the ability to respond plastically to temperature changes through developmental cold acclimation in inbred and outbred lines of five tropical and five widespread Drosophila species. Our results confirm that tropical species have lower cold resistance compared to widespread species, and show that (1) inbreeding reduces inherent cold resistance in both tropical and widespread species, (2) inbreeding does not affect the ability to respond adaptively to temperature acclimation, and (3) tropical species with low basal resistance show stronger adaptive plastic responses to developmental acclimation compared to widespread species. © 2011 The Author(s).

abstract={1.Urban-rural transects can be utilized as natural gradients of temperature and also as a tool to predict how plant ecology and physiology might respond to expected global change variables such as elevated temperatures, CO2 and inorganic nitrogen deposition. 2.We investigated differences in respiration (R) and the balance of electron partitioning through the cytochrome (CP) and alternative (AP) pathways in leaves of mature Quercus rubra L. trees along a transect from New York City to the Catskill Mountains over the course of one growing season. In addition, we investigated the effects of elevated temperature on Q. rubra seedlings in a controlled environment study. 3.In the field study, we found that urban-grown leaves often respired at greater rates than leaves grown at other sites and that this was likely due to higher leaf nitrogen. At each site, R at the prevailing growth temperature declined steadily throughout the growing season despite higher temperatures at the end of the summer. Differences in R were associated with changes in the relative abundances of cytochrome and alternative oxidase proteins. Oxygen isotope discrimination (D), which reflects relative changes in AP and CP partitioning, was negatively correlated with daily minimum temperature in trees grown at the colder rural sites, but not at the warmer urban sites. 4.In the growth cabinet study, we found that R acclimated to elevated temperatures and that this was accompanied by a steady increase in D. 5.These findings that AP partitioning increases with both high and low temperatures show that the AP may play an important role in plant responses to environmental conditions that elicit stress, and not simply to specific conditions such as low temperature. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity can contribute to the process of adaptive radiation by facilitating population persistence in novel environments. West Indian Anolis lizards provide a classic example of an adaptive radiation, in which divergence has occurred along two primary ecological axes: structural microhabitat and climate. Adaptive plasticity in limb morphology is hypothesized to have facilitated divergence along the structural niche axis in Anolis, but very little work has explored plasticity in physiological traits. Here, we experimentally ask whether Puerto Rican Anolis cristatellus from mesic and xeric habitats differ in desiccation rates, and whether these lizards exhibit an acclimation response to changes in relative humidity. We first present microclimatic data collected at lizard perch sites that demonstrate that abiotic conditions experienced by lizards differ between mesic and xeric habitat types. In Experiment 1, we measured desiccation rates of lizards from both habitats maintained under identical laboratory conditions. This experiment demonstrated that desiccation rates differ between populations; xeric lizards lose water more slowly than mesic lizards. In Experiment 2, lizards from each habitat were either maintained under the conditions of Experiment 1, or under extremely low relative humidity. Desiccation rates did not differ between lizards from the same habitat maintained under different treatments and xeric lizards maintained lower desiccation rates than mesic lizards within each treatment. Our results demonstrate that A. cristatellus does not exhibit an acclimation response to abrupt changes of hydric conditions, and suggest that tropical Anolis lizards might be unable to exhibit physiological plasticity in desiccation rates in response to varying climatic conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Oligosaccharide synthesis is an important cryoprotection strategy used by woody plants during winter dormancy. At the onset of autumn, starch stored in the stem and buds is broken down in response to the shorter days and lower temperatures resulting in the buildup of oligosaccharides. Given that the enzyme DSP4 is necessary for diurnal starch degradation in Arabidopsis leaves, this study was designed to address the role of DSP4 in this seasonal process in Castanea sativa Mill. The expression pattern of the CsDSP4 gene in cells of the chestnut stem was found to parallel starch catabolism. In this organ, DSP4 protein levels started to rise at the start of autumn and elevated levels persisted until the onset of spring. In addition, exposure of chestnut plantlets to 4°C induced the expression of the CsDSP4 gene. In dormant trees or cold-stressed plantlets, the CsDSP4 protein was immunolocalized both in the amyloplast stroma and nucleus of stem cells, whereas in the conditions of vegetative growth, immunofluorescence was only detected in the nucleus. The studies indicate a potential role for DSP4 in starch degradation and cold acclimation following low temperature exposure during activity-dormancy transition. In Arabidopsis leaves, the enzyme DSP4 is needed for diurnal starch degradation. Here, we examine the part played by DSP4 in this seasonal process in chestnut stems. Our findings point to a potential role for DSP4 in starch degradation and cold acclimation following low temperature exposure during activity-dormancy transition.

abstract={In the context of global environmental change much of the focus has been on changing temperatures. However, patterns of rainfall and water availability have also been changing and are expected to continue doing so. In consequence, understanding the responses of insects to water availability is important, especially because it has a pronounced influence on insect activity, distribution patterns, and species richness. Here we therefore provide a critical review of key questions that either are being or need to be addressed in this field. First, an overview of insect behavioural responses to changing humidity conditions and the mechanisms underlying sensing of humidity variation is provided. The primary sensors in insects belong to the temperature receptor protein superfamily of cation channels. Temperature-activated transient receptor potential ion channels, or thermoTRPs, respond to a diverse range of stimuli and may be a primary integrator of sensory information, such as environmental temperature and moisture. Next we touch briefly on the components of water loss, drawing attention to a new, universal model of the water costs of gas exchange and its implications for responses to a warming, and in places drying, world. We also provide an overview of new understanding of the role of the sub-elytral chamber for water conservation, and developments in understanding of the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in preventing water loss. Because of an increasing focus on the molecular basis of responses to dehydration stress we touch briefly on this area, drawing attention to the role of sugars, heat shock proteins, aquaporins, and LEA proteins. Next we consider phenotypic plasticity or acclimation responses in insect water balance after initial exposures to altered humidity, temperature or nutrition. Although beneficial acclimation has been demonstrated in several instances, this is not always the case. Laboratory studies show that responses to selection for enhanced ability to survive water stress do evolve and that genetic variation for traits underlying such responses does exist in many species. However, in others, especially tropical, typically narrowly distributed species, this appears not to be the case. Using the above information we then demonstrate that habitat alteration, climate change, biological invasions, pollution and overexploitation are likely to be having considerable effects on insect populations mediated through physiological responses (or the lack thereof) to water stress, and that these effects may often be non-intuitive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bud set, the cornerstone delimiting the seasonal growth period in trees, is the dynamic net result of the often photoperiod-controlled growth cessation and the subsequent bud formation. Here, we show that in hybrid poplar, the critical day length for growth cessation and the duration of bud formation each vary with local climatic conditions in identical genotypes. The detailed dissection of bud set suggests temperature as one additional environmental factor that modifies the sensitivity to day-length signals at growth cessation and influences the duration of bud formation in poplar. The ability of perennial plants to integrate additional environmental signals with photoperiod signaling may add to short-term acclimatization to the predicted longer growing seasons in future climates. © The Author 2011.

abstract={Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of temperature in the population dynamics and distribution of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caeruleus), few studies have examined the species' physiological response to temperature under controlled conditions. The effect of fluctuating thermal regimes on blood plasma cortisol, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (AST) and red blood cell (RBC) counts of Pacific sardine was evaluated to monitor physiological response. Sardines from the southern subpopulation that inhabits waters off Baja California, Mexico, were collected during fall 2008. Acclimation to four fluctuating temperature regimes (two symmetric and two asymmetric) and a constant, optimal temperature occurred over 20 d. Symmetric and asymmetric regimes were designed to simulate regional summer (18-23°C) and winter (13-18°C) temperature ranges within 24 h. In the optimal regime (OR), sardines were acclimated to 18°C. In symmetric regimes, sardines were exposed for 7 h to the high and low temperatures, while in asymmetric regimes exposure to the high temperature was shorter (4 vs. 10 h). Blood sampling took place during the low and high temperature exposure, and we tested for differences in blood parameters compared to OR. Plasma cortisol and glucose concentration of sardines from summer regimes were only significantly higher at 23°C. AST activities were significantly higher than OR during the high and low temperatures of both summer treatments. No differences were found in individuals exposed to the winter regimes. ALT activities were significantly higher than OR only during the high and low temperature of the symmetric summer regime. RBC were significantly higher than OR for both summer regimes. Sardines from southern subpopulation exhibit a negative physiological response to high temperatures, yet they can acclimate to the lower (≤18°C) temperatures typical of the California Current System. Temperatures ≥23°C may be considered a detrimental sublethal temperature, particularly for long exposure periods. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

First published February 10, 2011; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol. 01193.2010.-We examined whether enhanced cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses during exercise after short-term aerobic training in a warm environment were reversed when plasma volume (PV) expansion was reversed by acute isotonic hypohydration. Seven young men performed aerobic training at the 70% peak oxygen consumption rate (VO2peak) at 30°C atmospheric temperature and 50% relative humidity, 30 min/day for 5 days. Before and after training, we performed the thermoregulatory response test while measuring esophageal temperature (Tes), forearm skin vascular conductance, sweat rate (SR), and PV during 30 min exercise at the metabolic rate equivalent to pretraining 65%VO2peak in euhydration under the same environment as during training in four trials (euhydration and hypohydration, respectively). Hypohydration targeting 3% body mass was attained by combined treatment with low-salt meals to subjects from ̃48 h before the test and administration of a diuretic ̃4 h before the test. After training, the Tes thresholds for cutaneous vasodilation and sweating decreased by 0.3 and 0.2°C (P = 0.008 and 0.012, respectively) when PV increased by ̃10%. When PV before and after training was reduced to a similar level, ̃10% reduction from that in euhydration before training, the training-induced reduction in the threshold for cutaneous vasodilation increased to a level similar to hypohydration before training (P = 0.093) while that for sweating remained significantly lower than that before training (P = 0.004). Thus the enhanced cutaneous vasodilation response after aerobic training in a warm environment was reversed when PV expansion was reversed while the enhanced SR response remained partially.

abstract={Seasonal acclimation and thermoregulation represent major components of complex thermal strategies by which ectotherms cope with the heterogeneity of their thermal environment. Some ectotherms possess the acclimatory capacity to shift seasonally their thermoregulatory behavior, but the frequent use of constant acclimation temperatures during experiments and the lack of information about thermal heterogeneity in the field obscures the ecological relevance of this plastic response. We examined the experimentally induced seasonal acclimation of preferred body temperatures (Tp) in alpine newts Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris subjected to a gradual increase in acclimation temperature from 5°C during the winter to a constant 15°C or diel fluctuations between 10° and 20°C during the spring/summer. Both the mean and range of Tp followed the increase in mean acclimation temperature without the influence of diel temperature fluctuations. The direction and magnitude of this acclimatory capacity has the potential to increase the time window available for thermoregulation. Although thermoregulation and thermal acclimation are often considered as separate but coadapted adjustments to thermal heterogeneity, their combined response is employed by newts to tackle seasonal variation in a thermoregulatory-challenging aquatic environment. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={The responses of organisms to temperature variations may be via short term responses of the phenotype (phenotypic plasticity), or they could involve long-term evolutionary change and adaptation (via selection) to the genotype. These could involve changes to the mean size of the animal or to the thermal reaction norm. We examined the effects of various temperatures (of 22, 25, 28, and 31°C) on development time, adult body size and preadult survivorship in three populations of the cockroach, Eupolyphaga sinensis (Walker), collected at different latitudes. We found substantial temperature-induced plasticity in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship, indicating that developmental temperatures have strong impacts on growth and life history traits of E. sinensis. Genetic differences for development time, body size, and preadult survivorship were detected among populations, and the three traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions, indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms. We also found that two populations seem to support the beneficial acclimation hypothesis whereas the third mid-latitude population does not. The results are likely because of differences in season length and voltinism, indicating that not only temperature regime but also its interactions with generation time (and development time), voltinism, and season length are likely to have considerable effects on insect development time and body size. Overall, changes in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship in E. sinensis can all be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Temperature is a primary determinant of insect and other ectotherm distribution and activity. Physiological and behavioral adaptations allow many insects to survive at subzero temperatures, yet the evolutionary influences on insect cold tolerance are unclear. Supercooling points, basal cold tolerance, coldtolerance strategy, and inducible cold tolerance from rapid coldhardening or acclimation were measured in a phylogenetically independent context in larvae of 27 phylogenetically diverse Drosophila species acquired from stock collections. Supercooling capacity is attributed primarily to physical factors, such as dry mass and water mass. Species of the obscura group were more resistant to acute cold tolerance than species of other groups within the genus, and plasticity in cold tolerance is constrained by phylogeny rather than by basal cold tolerance.The more cold-tolerant freeze-avoiding species appear to have arisen multiple times in Drosophila and are distinct from chillsusceptible species, which likely indicate the ancestral state. A phylogenetic influence is apparent on several measures of cold tolerance, which show considerable interspecific variation and indicate varying physiological mechanisms among Drosophila species when temperature limits are met. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Many organisms modify their physiological functions by acclimating to changes in their environment. Recent studies of thermal physiology have been influenced by verbal models that fail to consider the selective advantage of acclimation and thus make no predictions about variation in acclimation capacity. We used a quantitative model of optimal plasticity to generate predictions about the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to acclimate to developmental temperature. This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations. Based on the model, we expected that flies from the highly seasonal environment of New Jersey would acclimate thermal sensitivity more than would flies from the less seasonal environment of Florida. When raised at constant and fluctuating temperatures, flies from these populations failed to adjust their thermal optima in the way predicted by the model, suggesting that current assumptions about functional and genetic constraints should be reconsidered. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={We examined spatial and temporal dynamics of foliage respiration in canopies of dominant and suppressed Eucalyptus globulus trees to better understand processes regulating foliage respiration in a young fast-growing stand. Temperature response functions and seasonal measures of respiration (measured at a reference temperature of 15 °C, R15) were studied for ∼1 year to (i) examine controls on respiration as a function of canopy position, foliar nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations and (ii) assess the capacity for thermal acclimation within E. globulus canopies. The short-term temperature response of respiration varied both with canopy position and seasonally. Area-based R15 measurements declined with increasing canopy depth and were strongly related to foliar N concentrations, especially in upper-canopy positions. R15 was negatively correlated with the average temperature of the preceding 14 days, a pattern consistent with thermal acclimation. In suppressed canopies, R15 was higher than that at similar canopy heights in dominant trees. Similarly, foliar concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates were also relatively higher in suppressed canopies than dominant canopies, providing support for a substrate-based model of leaf respiration. Our data highlight the dynamic nature of foliar respiration within E. globulus canopies, which contrasts with the generally simplistic representation of respiration within most process-based models. © The Author 2010.

abstract={To evaluate the effects of heat acclimation on sweat rate redistribution and thermodynamic parameters, 9 tropical native volunteers were submitted to 11 days of exercise-heat exposures (40±0°C and 45.1±0.2% relative humidity). Sudomotor function was evaluated by measuring total and local (forehead, chest, arm, forearm, and thigh) sweat rates, local sweat sodium concentration, and mean skin and rectal temperatures. We also calculated heat production (H), heat storage (S), heat exchange by radiation (R) and by convection (C), evaporated sweat (Esw), sweating efficiency (ηsw), skin wettedness (wsk), and the ratio between the heat storage and the sum of heat production and heat gains by radiation and convection (S/(H+R+C)). The heat acclimation increased the whole-body sweat rate and reduced the mean skin temperature. There were changes in the local sweat rate patterns: on the arm, forearm, and thigh it increased significantly from day 1 to day 11 (all p&lt;0.05) and the sweat rates from the forehead and the chest showed a small nonsignificant increase (p=0.34 and 0.17, respectively). The relative increase of local sweat rates on day 11 was not different among the sites; however, when comparing the limbs (arm, forearm, and thigh) with the trunk (forehead and chest), there was a significant higher increase in the limbs (32±5%) in comparison to the trunk (11±2%, p=0.001). After the heat acclimation period we observed higher wsk and Esw and reduced S/(H+R+C), meaning greater thermoregulatory efficiency. The increase in the limb sweat rate, but not the increase in the trunk sweat rate, correlated with the increased wsk, Esw, and reduced S/(H+R+C) (p&lt;0.05 to all). Altogether, it can be concluded that heat acclimation increased the limbs' sweat rates in tropical natives and that this increase led to increased loss of heat through evaporation of sweat and this higher sweat evaporation was related to higher thermoregulatory efficiency.},

abstract={The effects of acclimation temperature on insect thermal performance curves are generally poorly understood but significant for understanding responses to future climate variation and the evolution of these reaction norms. Here, in Acheta domesticus, we examine the physiological effects of 7-9 days acclimation to temperatures 4°C above and below optimum growth temperature of 29°C (i.e. 25, 29, 33°C) for traits of resistance to thermal extremes, temperature-dependence of locomotion performance (jumping distance and running speed) and temperature-dependence of respiratory metabolism. We also examine the effects of acclimation on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) enzyme activity. Chill coma recovery time (CRRT) was significantly reduced from 38 to 13min with acclimation at 33-25°C, respectively. Heat knockdown resistance was less responsive than CCRT to acclimation, with no significant effects of acclimation detected for heat knockdown times (25°C: 18.25, 29°C: 18.07, 33°C: 25.5min). Thermal optima for running speed were higher (39.4-40.6°C) than those for jumping performance (25.6-30.9°C). Acclimation temperature affected jumping distance but not running speed (general linear model, p=0.0075) although maximum performance (UMAX) and optimum temperature (TOPT) of the performance curves showed small or insignificant effects of acclimation temperature. However, these effects were sensitive to the method of analysis since analyses of TOPT, UMAX and the temperature breadth (TBR) derived from non-linear curve-fitting approaches produced high inter-individual variation within acclimation groups and reduced variation between acclimation groups. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) was positively related to body mass and test temperature. Acclimation temperature significantly influenced the slope of the SMR-temperature reaction norms, whereas no variation in the intercept was found. The CCO enzyme activity remained unaffected by thermal acclimation. Finally, high temperature acclimation resulted in significant increases in mortality (60-70% at 33°C vs. 20-30% at 25 and 29°C). These results suggest that although A. domesticus may be able to cope with low temperature extremes to some degree through phenotypic plasticity, population declines with warmer mean temperatures of only a few degrees are likely owing to the limited plasticity of their performance curves. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The accumulation of cryoprotectants and the redistribution of water between body compartments play central roles in the capacity of insects to survive freezing. Aquaporins (AQPs) allow for rapid redistribution of water and small solutes (e.g. glycerol) across the cell membrane and were recently implicated in promoting freeze tolerance. Here, we examined whether aquaporin-like protein abundance correlated with the seasonal acquisition of freezing tolerance in the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). Through the autumn, larvae became tolerant of freezing at progressively lower temperatures and accumulated the cryoprotectant glycerol. Furthermore, larvae significantly increased the abundance of membrane-bound aquaporin and aquaglyceroporin-like proteins from July through January. Acute exposure of larvae to cold and desiccation resulted in upregulation of the AQP3-like proteins in October, suggesting that their abundance is regulated by environmental cues. The seasonal increase in abundance of both putative aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins supports the hypothesis that these proteins are closely tied to the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance, functioning to permit cells to quickly lose water and take-up glycerol during extracellular ice formation, as well as reestablish water and glycerol concentrations upon thawing. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Since most conifer species are commonly distributed in low-temperature regions, information of the photosynthetic response to temperature of conifers growing in high-temperature regions is little known. In order to obtain information on the photosynthetic response of conifers to global warming, the photosynthetic responses of 7 conifers grown from low to high elevations in subtropical Taiwan to both growth and measurement temperatures were studied. The results indicated that plants, except Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana, grown at high temperatures (30/23°C, day/ night), exhibited lower inhibition of the light-saturated photosynthetic rate (PN) at high temperature and an increase in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (Topt). The Topt values of conifers with low- and high-elevational distributions grown at low temperatures (20/10°C) were 20∼23 and 16∼21°C, respectively; and Topt values of these conifers grown at high temperatures were 23∼27 and 21°C, respectively. Differences in T opt values for 3 conifers (Nageia nagi, Podocarpus macrophyllus, and Calocedrus macrolepis var. formosana) with low-elevation (&lt; 1000∼1900 m) distributions, and 1 conifer (Pinus taiwanensis) with a broad-elevational (750∼3000 m) distribution with low- and high-temperature acclimation were 2.2∼7.7°C; those for 2 conifers with high-elevational distributions (Cha. formosensis and Cha. obtusa var. formosana, 1000∼2900 m) were -0.7∼2.3°C. In addition, 1 species with a high-elevational distribution (Tsuga chinensis var. formosana, 2000∼3500 m) grown at low temperatures, and 1 species (P. taiwanensis) with a broad elevational distribution grown at high-temperatures both maintained relatively high PN values (≥ 90% of the maximum) at wide temperature ranges (8∼24 and 18∼34°C, respectively). From the above results it was concluded that, just like broadleaf evergreen trees, the photosynthesis of conifer plants distributed at low and high elevations in Taiwan adapts to the temperature of their habitat through both genetic variations and thermal acclimation. Conifers with low- and broad-elevational distributions generally exhibited a higher potentiality for thermal acclimation of the Topt when growth temperatures shifted from low to high.},

abstract={Patterns of clinal genetic variation in Drosophila are often characterized after rearing at constant temperatures. However, clinal patterns might change after acclimation if populations differ in their plastic response to fluctuating environments. We studied longevity, starvation and heat knock-down resistance after development at either constant or fluctuating temperatures in nine Drosophila buzzatii populations collected along an altitudinal gradient in Tenerife, Spain. Flies that developed at fluctuating temperatures had higher stress resistance despite experiencing a slightly lower average temperature than those at constant temperatures. Genetic variation along the gradient was found in both stress-resistance traits. Because QST values greatly exceeded FST values, genetic drift could not explain this diversification. In general, differences among populations were larger after rearing at fluctuating temperatures, especially in heat knock-down, for which clinal patterns disappeared when flies were reared at constant temperatures. This result emphasizes the importance of determining whether populations originating from different environments differ in their plastic responses to stress. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in thermally sensitive traits, that is, thermal acclimation, generally increases with increasing latitude and altitude. The presumed explanation is that high-latitude/ altitude organisms have evolved greater acclimation ability because of exposure to greater temperature fluctuations. Using a conceptual model of the thermal environment during the reproductive season, we tested this hypothesis against an alternative that plasticity is greater because of increased exposure to specific temperatures that strongly select for thermal acclimation. We examined geographic variation in floral reflectance/color plasticity among 29 European populations of a widespread perennial herb, Plantago lanceolata. Individuals partially thermoregulate reproduction through temperature-sensitive plasticity in floral reflectance/color. Plasticity was positively correlated with latitude and altitude. Path analyses support the hypothesis that the thermal environment mediates these geographic effects. Plasticity declined as seasonal temperature range increased, and it increased as duration of the growing season shortened and as the proportion of time exposed to temperatures favoring thermoregulation increased. Data provide evidence that floral re-flectance/color plasticity is adaptive and that it has evolved in response not to the magnitude of temperature variation during the reproductive season but rather to the relative exposure to low temperatures, which favor thermoregulation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Behavioral thermoregulation can allow ectotherms to buffer the effects of changes in environmental temperature, and thus an organism's preferred temperature is thought to be under strong selection. However, this contention has seldom been tested. We used common killifish Fundulus heteroclitus from high-latitude (northern) and low-latitude (southern) populations to investigate intraspecific variation in thermal preference and its relationship to habitat temperature. We quantified the preferred temperatures of northern and southern killifish populations acclimated to three temperatures (5°, 15°, and 25°C) to evaluate two alternative hypotheses for the evolution of differences in thermal preference among latitudinally separated populations: local thermal adaptation, which predicts that organisms from high latitudes should prefer lower temperatures than individuals from lower latitudes, versus countergradient variation, which predicts that high-latitude organisms should prefer higher temperatures to compensate for shorter growing seasons. All killifish selected their final thermal preferendum within 4 h. Southern killifish and killifish acclimated to warmer temperatures had greater variability in selected temperature. This increase in variability was the result of an increase in interindividual variation in preferred temperature rather than a reduction in the precision of temperature selection in these groups. Northern killifish preferred significantly higher temperatures than southern fish (30.6° vs. 29.0°C, respectively, when calculated on the basis of the temperature selected consistently for at least 30 min; 28.4° vs. 26.5°C, respectively, when calculated on the basis of the mean temperature occupied), regardless of acclimation temperature. These data are not consistent with local adaptation in thermal preference but instead can be better explained by countergradient variation in thermal preference in killifish. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={In the present study, various body size scaling relationships describing the physiological performance of plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L.) were derived using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model and compared with allometric relationships derived from a static energy budget (SEB) model. Results indicated that DEB models can correctly predict the physiological performance of plaice within variable environments. Dynamic energy budgets are preferred over static energy budgets because they are not descriptive but based on first principles, they are not species-specific, and they can be used for extrapolations beyond the range of experimental data. Nevertheless, some aspects of the DEB model can still be improved. These include: [1] processes underlying the temperature tolerance range, temperature acclimation and the relationship between optimal temperature and body size; [2] the contribution of various processes to metabolism; and [3] the incorporation and quantification of Fry's scheme of the environment, especially of masking factors (e.g., sub-optimal salinity conditions which load the minimum metabolism) and limiting factors (e.g., low oxygen conditions that constrain the maximum metabolic rate).

abstract={Our understanding of leaf acclimation in relation to temperature of fully grown or juvenile tree crowns is mainly based on research involving spatially uncontrolled growth temperature. In this study, we test the hypothesis that leaf morphology and chemical elements are modulated by within-crown growth temperature differences. We ask whether within-species variation can influence acclimation to elevated temperatures. Within-crown temperature dependence of leaf morphology, carbon and nitrogen was examined in two genotypes of Acer rubrum L. (red maple) from different latitudes, where the mean annual temperature varies between 7.2 and 19.4 °C. Crown sections were grown in temperature-controlled chambers at three daytime growth temperatures (25, 33 and 38 °C). Leaf growth and resource acquisition were measured at regular intervals over long-term (50 days) controlled daytime growth temperatures. We found significant intraspecific variation in temperature dependence of leaf carbon and nitrogen accumulation between genotypes. Additionally, there was evidence that leaf morphology depended on inherited adaptation. Leaf dry matter and nitrogen content decreased as growth temperature was elevated above 25 °C in the genotype native to the cooler climate, whereas they remained fairly constant in response to temperature in the genotype native to the warmer climate. Specific leaf area (SLA) was correlated positively to leaf nitrogen content in both genotypes. The SLA and the relative leaf dry matter content (LM), on the other hand, were correlated negatively to leaf thickness. However, intraspecific variation in SLA and LM versus leaf thickness was highly significant. Intraspecific differences in leaf temperature response between climatically divergent genotypes yielded important implications for convergent evolution of leaf adaptation. Comparison of our results with those of previous studies showed that leaf carbon allocation along a vertical temperature gradient was modulated by growth temperature in the genotype native to the cooler climate. This indicates that within-crown temperature-induced variations in leaf morphology and chemical content should be accounted for in forest ecosystem models.},

abstract={To increase yield in pea (Pisum sativum L.), autumn sowing would be preferable. Hence, frost tolerance of pea became a major trait of interest for breeders. In order to better understand the cold acclimation in pea, Champagne a frost tolerant line and Terese, a frost sensitive line, and their recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were studied. RIL frost tolerance was evaluated by a frost damage scale under field as well as controlled conditions. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach was used to identify chromosomal regions linked to frost tolerance. The detected QTL explained from 6.5 to 46.5% of the phenotypic variance. Amongst them, those located on linkage groups 5 and 6 were consistent with over all experiments, in field as well as in controlled environments. In order to improve the understanding of the frost tolerance mechanisms, several cold acclimation key characters such as concentration of sugars, electrolyte leakage, osmotic pressure, and activity of RuBisCO were assessed. Some of these physiological QTL colocalised with QTL for frost damage, in particular two raffinose QTL on LG5 and LG6 and one RuBisCO activity QTL on LG6, explaining 8.8 to 27.0% of the phenotypic variance. In addition, protein quantitative loci were mapped; some of them colocalised with frost damage and physiological QTL on LG5 and LG6, explaining 16.0-43.6% of the phenotypic variance. Raffinose metabolism and RuBisCO activity and its effect on photosynthesis might play a major role in cold acclimation of pea. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={It has been argued that species living under unpredictable thermal conditions need to have more flexible physiological capabilities to meet with thermal stress than species living in thermally stable environments. Here we investigate if the ability to rapidly cold-harden in Collembola is influenced by thermal conditions of the habitat. 2. Collembola exploit diverse habitats and are therefore exposed to different thermal environments: soil dwelling (euedaphic) species occupy relatively stable environments, whereas surface dwelling (epedaphic) species can be exposed to more fluctuating thermal environments, but a single species can also be found in diverse thermal habitats within its geographic distribution. 3. We compared the inherent cold shock tolerance and ability to rapidly cold-harden in three epedaphic, two near surface dwelling (hemiedaphic) and four euedaphic species of Collembola using a similar experimental approach for all species. Additionally we compared three populations of the epedaphic species, Orchesella cincta, sampled along a climatic gradient (Norway, Denmark, Italy). 4. Inherent cold shock tolerance was estimated as LT50 by assaying cold shock survival following a 2 h exposure to a range of temperatures from 1 °C to -12 °C. Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) was induced by cooling individuals from 20 °C to a temperature 7 °C above the LT50 during 80 min, followed by 1 h at the specific cold shock temperature, which was close to the LT50 of the particular species. 5. There was large variation in cold shock survival among species. The capacity to rapidly cold-harden was found in all three ecotypes. 6. Genetic difference in the ability to rapidly cold-harden was seen in O. cincta from different climatic regions, consistent with the predictability of the thermal environment of their habitat. Population differences matched the daily fluctuations in temperature (CV) recorded at the site of collection as well as the day-to-day predictability (autocorrelation). The role of phylogenetic inertia was tested using sequence data from the cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene and no signal of phylogeny was detected that could explain these population differences. 7. Our results show that genetic differences in RCH ability exist, consistent with latitudinal gradients in thermal fluctuations and predictability; thus comparative studies can provide important insight when exploring the role of acclimation in the geographical distribution of species. © 2008 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Even though molt involves both endocrine and energetic changes in bird bodies, this study is among the first to combine assessments of energy costs together with thyroid hormone variations in molting birds. Individual shorebirds (red knots Calidris canutus islandica) were measured while in full summer and winter plumage as well as during peak of molt. Molt was associated with a 9.8% increase in average mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR) above nonmolting levels. Individual plasma levels of thyroxine (T4) were correlated with individual rate of body feather renewal, confirming that T4 is related to body molt but also showing that it is potentially regulating its rate. Across seasons, mass-independent average heat loss measured as conductance gradually declined with conductance during molt falling between measured values for summer and winter. During the molting period, however, body molting rate was positively correlated with thermal conductance, indicating that for a given ambient temperature below thermoneutrality, the fastest molting birds were losing more body heat. Across seasons, triiodothyronine (T3), a hormone typically upregulated in response to a cold stimulus, was correlated with individual thermal conductance and BMR. We suggest that the increased heat loss of fast-molting birds leads to a cold-acclimatization response that may be partly responsible for the elevated BMR measured during molt. This could be mediated through a stimulatory effect of T3 on BMR in response to increased heat loss. Our interpretation is supported by a positive relationship between the individual changes in conductance and the change in BMR from summer to the molting period. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Winter acclimatization in small birds overwintering in cold climates, including house sparrows (Passer domesticus), is associated with improved cold tolerance, elevated summit metabolic rates (Msum = maximum cold-induced metabolic rate), and increased pectoralis muscle mass compared to summer birds. Myostatin is a potent autocrine/paracrine inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth in mammals and birds and is a potential candidate for regulation of seasonal phenotypic flexibility in birds. As a first step toward examining such a role for myostatin in small birds, we measured summer and winter gene expression of myostatin and its potential metalloproteinase activators TLL-1 and TLL-2 in house sparrows from southeastern South Dakota. Gene expression of myostatin decreased significantly in winter, with summer values exceeding winter values by 1.52-fold. Moreover, gene expression of TLL-1 was also significantly reduced in winter, with summer values exceeding winter values by 1.55-fold. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the winter increases in pectoralis muscle mass, Msum, and cold tolerance in house sparrows are mediated by reduced levels of myostatin and its activator TLL-1, and they suggest the possibility that myostatin may be a common mediator of phenotypic flexibility of muscle mass in birds. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Light conditions on the floor of deciduous forests are determined by the leaf dynamics of canopy trees and gap formation. Such spatiotemporal variations of light availability should affect the resource partitioning strategies of understory herbs. Although rhizomatous species are common in understory, relationships between rhizome structure, vegetative growth, and sexual reproduction are unclear in terms of carbon allocation. We compared the photosynthetic characteristics and carbon translocation patterns in the under-canopy and light-gap sites between two summer-green perennial species: Cardamine leucantha with an annual long rhizome, and Smilacina japonica with a perennial short rhizome system. Flowering of both species occurs in early summer under decreasing light availability. In the light-gap, C. leucantha maintained high photosynthetic activity due to continuous leaf production, resulting in higher seed production than in the under-canopy. In contrast, the photosynthetic rate of S. japonica, producing leaves simultaneously, decreased with time irrespective of light conditions, resulting in stable seed production in both sites. Although seasonally decreasing light availability commonly restricts carbon assimilation of understory herbs, the responses of resource partitioning to variations in light availability depend greatly on the belowground structure of individual species. © 2009 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.},

abstract={As global temperatures rise, there is a growing need to understand the physiological mechanisms that determine an organism's thermal niche. Here, we test the hypothesis that increases in mitochondrial capacity with cold acclimation and adaptation are associated with decreases in thermal tolerance using two subspecies of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that differ in thermal niche. We assessed whole-organism metabolic rate, mitochondrial amount and mitochondrial function in killifish acclimated to several temperatures. Mitochondrial enzyme activities and mRNA levels were greater in fish from the northern subspecies, particularly in cold-acclimated fish, suggesting that the putatively cold-adapted northern subspecies has a greater capacity for increases in mitochondrial amount in response to cold acclimation. When tested at the fish's acclimation temperature, maximum ADP-stimulated (State III) rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vitro were greater in cold-acclimated northern fish than in southern fish but did not differ between subspecies at higher acclimation temperatures. Whole-organism metabolic rate was greater in fish of the northern subspecies at all acclimation temperatures. Cold acclimation also changed the response of mitochondrial respiration to acute temperature challenge. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was greater in cold-acclimated northern fish than in southern fish at low test temperatures, but the opposite was true at high test temperatures. These differences were reflected in whole-organism oxygen consumption. Our data indicate that the plasticity of mitochondrial function and amount differs between killifish subspecies, with the less high-temperature tolerant, and putatively cold adapted, northern subspecies having greater ability to increase mitochondrial capacity in the cold. However, there were few differences in mitochondrial properties between subspecies at warm acclimation temperatures, despite differences in both whole-organism oxygen consumption and thermal tolerance at these temperatures.},

abstract={• Temperature acclimation of respiration may contribute to climatic adaptation and thus differ among populations from contrasting climates. • Short-term temperature responses of foliar dark respiration were measured in 33-yr-old trees of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) in eight populations of wide-ranging origin (44-55°N) grown in a common garden at 46.7°N. It was tested whether seasonal adjustments in respiration and population differences in this regard resulted from changes in base respiration rate at 5°C (R 5) or Q10 (temperature sensitivity) and covaried with nitrogen and soluble sugars. • In all populations, acclimation was manifest primarily through shifts in R5 rather than altered Q10. R5 was higher in cooler periods in late autumn and winter and lower in spring and summer, inversely tracking variation in ambient air temperature. Overall, R5 covaried with sugars and not with nitrogen. Although acclimation was comparable among all populations, the observed seasonal ranges in R5 and Q10 were greater in populations originating from warmer than from colder sites. Population differences in respiratory traits appeared associated with autumnal cold hardening. • Common patterns of respiratory temperature acclimation among biogeographically diverse populations provide a basis for predicting respiratory carbon fluxes in a wide-ranging species. © The Authors (2008).},

abstract={In a changing environment the ability to adjust physiological functions to new conditions might be especially valuable for long-living ectothermic animals such as ants. With a simple method for estimating critical thermal minima of Myrmica ants we assessed variation of the minima and their response to lowered temperature. At a cooling rate of about 1°C per minute the ants first displayed knock-down (at temperatures 1.5 to -0.2°C) and only later immobilized completely (at -1.3 to -3.1°C). Pre-chilling of ants at 5°C for l h lowered the parameters significantly but not greatly (about 0.9°C). Constant laboratory conditions (20°C) raised the knock-down temperature and tended to lower the temperature of immobilization. In the same manner the two parameters changed in field conditions in June, but no significant change occurred through August and until the end of study season in mid-September. When populations from different geographic localities were compared, populations from the north showed lower knock-down temperatures. The magnitude of these apparently genetic differences among populations was comparable to the magnitude of plastic changes that occurred either naturally, or in experiments, or in laboratory culture. The little plasticity and low geographic variation of the critical thermal minima may indicate that the ability of the ants to withstand cold events and populate varying climates bases mainly on the protective properties of nesting substrate.},

abstract={Effects of habitat and acclimation temperature on cholesterol contents were examined in oceanic and inshore species of copepods. The cholesterol content of five species of thermally acclimated copepods was determined, and nine species (representing six families) were sampled to assess the role of habitat temperature. The species selected have maximum habitat temperatures (and temperature tolerances) that vary at least twofold. Levels of dietary cholesterol required to achieve maximum growth were also studied at different acclimation temperatures in a eurythermal copepod. Both eggs and copepodites of Calanus finmarchicus had higher cholesterol levels at the warm acclimation temperature (16°C) than at the cooler temperature (6°C). Neither Acartia tonsa, Acartia hudsonica, Temora longicornis nor Eurytemora affinis altered cholesterol contents with acclimation temperature. Maximum growth rates were achieved at fourfold higher concentrations of dietary cholesterol in warm-acclimated Eurytemora affinis than in cold-acclimated animals. The most consistent trend is the positive relationship between cholesterol content and habitat temperature. Species residing in warmer habitats (e.g. Centropages typicus, Eurytemora affinis) had approximately twice the cholesterol of species living in colder waters (e.g. Calanus glacialis, Euchaeta norvegica). A similar pattern was observed for comparisons of species within genera (Calanus, Acartia and Centropages), with the species abundant at lower latitudes having more cholesterol than the northern congener. These data indicate that habitat temperature is an important determinant of cholesterol content, and cholesterol endows membranes with the stability required for a range of body temperatures.},

abstract={Few studies have examined the extent to which phenotypic plasticity in a given trait might be influenced by behavioural responses to an environmental cue. Regulatory behaviour might eliminate environmental variation such that little selection for physiological change would take place. Here, to test this Bogert effect on acclimation, we use two life-stages of a kelp fly that inhabit the same habitat, but differ profoundly in their behaviour. We predicted that when denied opportunities for behavioural regulation, mobile, though brachypterous adults would show a performance advantage in most thermal environments following acclimation to their preferred temperature(s). By contrast, in the less mobile larvae, that have a broader thermal preference, beneficial acclimation would be more evident. Ordered factor anova with orthogonal polynomial contrasts revealed that adults recovered faster from chill coma following any one of six short-term temperature treatments if they had been acclimated at low temperature, whilst larvae showed beneficial acclimation. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Warming-induced release of CO2 from the large carbon (C) stores in arctic soils could accelerate climate change. However, declines in the response of soil respiration to warming in long-term experiments suggest that microbial activity acclimates to temperature, greatly reducing the potential for enhanced C losses. As reduced respiration rates with time could be equally caused by substrate depletion, evidence for thermal acclimation remains controversial. To overcome this problem, we carried out a cooling experiment with soils from arctic Sweden. If acclimation causes the reduction in soil respiration observed after experimental warming, then it should subsequently lead to an increase in respiration rates after cooling. We demonstrate that thermal acclimation did not occur following cooling. Rather, during the 90 days after cooling, a further reduction in the soil respiration rate was observed, which was only reversed by extended re-exposure to warmer temperatures. We conclude that over the time scale of a few weeks to months, warming-induced changes in the microbial community in arctic soils will amplify the instantaneous increase in the rates of CO2 production and thus enhance C losses potentially accelerating the rate of 21st century climate change. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Small mammals that are active all year must develop ways to survive the cold winters. Endotherms that experience prolonged cold exposure often increase their thermogenic capacity. Thermogenic capacity incorporates basal metabolic rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), and shivering thermogenesis (ST). Increasing the capacity of any of these components will result in increased thermogenic capacity. It is often thought that NST should be the most plastic component of thermogenic capacity and as such is the most likely to increase with cold acclimation. We used deer mice to test this hypothesis by acclimating 27 animals to one of two temperatures (5° or 22°C) for 8 wk. We then measured and compared values for thermogenic capacity - BMR, ST, and NST - between the two groups. Thermogenic capacity and NST increased by 21% and 42%, respectively, after cold acclimation. Neither BMR nor ST showed any change after acclimation. Therefore, it appears that deer mice raise their thermogenic capacity in response to prolonged cold by altering NST only. © 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

B.S.P.] grown at 22/14°C [low temperature (LT)] or 30/22°C [high temperature (HT)] day/night temperatures. Net CO2 assimilation rates (Anet) were greater in LT than in HT seedlings below 30°C, but were greater in HT seedlings above 30°C. Dark and day respiration rates were similar between treatments at the respective growth temperatures. When respiration was factored out of the photosynthesis response to temperature, the resulting gross CO 2 assimilation rates (Agross) was lower in HT than in LT seedlings below 30°C, but was similar above 30°C. The reduced A gross of HT seedlings was associated with lower needle nitrogen content, lower ribulose 1·5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) maximum carboxylation rates (Vcmax) and lower maximum electron transport rates (Jmax). Growth treatment did not affect V cmax: Jmax. Modelling of the CO2 response of photosynthesis indicated that LT seedlings at 40°C might have been limited by heat lability of Rubisco activase, but that in HT seedlings, Rubisco capacity was limiting. In sum, thermal acclimation of Anet was largely caused by reduced respiration and lower nitrogen investments in needles from HT seedlings. At 40°C, photosynthesis in LT seedlings might be limited by Rubisco activase capacity, while in HT seedlings, acclimation removed this limitation. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={In organisms with complex life cycles, the adaptive value of thermotolerance depends on life-history timing and seasonal temperature profiles. We illustrate this concept by examining variation in annual thermal environments and thermal acclimation among four geographic populations of the pitcher plant mosquito. Only diapausing larvae experience winter, whereas both postdiapause and nondiapause adults occur only during the growing season. Thus, adults experience transient cold stress primarily during the spring. We show that adult cold tolerance (chill coma recovery) is enhanced in spring-like conditions via thermal acclimation but is unaffected by diapause state. Moreover, adult mosquitoes from northern populations were more cold tolerant than those from southern populations largely because acclimation responses were steeper in the north. In contrast to cold tolerance, there was no significant acclimation of heat tolerance (heat knockdown), and no significant differences in heat tolerance between northern and southern populations. Field temperature data show that because of evolved differences in diapause timing, adult exposure to cold stress is remarkably consistent across geography. This suggests that geographic variation in cold tolerance may not be the result of direct selection on adults. Our results illustrate the importance of the interplay between phenological and thermal adaptation for understanding variation along climatic gradients. © 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract={Productivity and climate models often use a constant Q10 for plant respiration, assuming tight control of respiration by temperature. We studied the temperature response of leaf respiration of two cold climate species (the Australian tree Eucalyptus pauciflora and the subantarctic megaherb Pringlea antiscorbutica, both measured in a field setting) on a short timescale (minutes) during different times within a diel course, and on a longer timescale, using diel variations in ambient temperature. There were great variations in Q10 depending on measuring day, measuring time and measuring method. When Q10 was calculated from short-term (15 min) manipulations of leaf temperature, the resulting values were usually markedly smaller than when Q10 was calculated from measurements at ambient leaf temperatures spread over a day. While for E. pauciflora, Q10 estimates decreased with rising temperature (corroborating the concept of a temperature-dependent Q10), the opposite was the case for P. antiscorbutica. Clearly, factors other than temperature co-regulate both leaf respiration rates and temperature sensitivity and contribute to diel and seasonal variation of respiration. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

Assays were performed at multiple minimum temperatures and on both cold-acclimated and non-cold-acclimated individuals. • Considerable variation in freezing tolerance was observed among accessions both with and without a prior cold-acclimation treatment, suggesting that differences among accessions in cold-acclimation capacity as well as differences in intrinsic physiology contribute to variation in this phenotype. A highly significant positive relationship was observed between freezing tolerance and latitude of origin of accessions, consistent with a major role for natural selection in shaping variation in this phenotype. • Clinal variation in freezing tolerance in A. thaliana coupled with considerable knowledge of the underlying genetics and physiology of this phenotype should allow evolutionary genetic analysis at multiple levels. © The Authors (2007).},

abstract={The fundamental equation of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) indicates that most of the variation in metabolic rate are a consequence of variation in organismal size and environmental temperature. Although evolution is thought to minimize energy costs of nutrient transport, its effects on metabolic rate via adaptation, acclimatization or acclimation are considered small, and restricted mostly to variation in the scaling constant, b0. This contrasts strongly with many conclusions of evolutionary physiology and life-history theory, making closer examination of the fundamental equation an important task for evolutionary biologists. Here we do so using scorpions as model organisms. First, we investigate the implications for the fundamental equation of metabolic rate variation and its temperature dependence in the scorpion Uroplectes carinatus following laboratory acclimation. During 22 days of acclimation at 25°C metabolic rates declined significantly (from 127.4 to 78.2 μW; P = 0.0001) whereas mean body mass remained constant (367.9-369.1 mg; P = 0.999). In field-fresh scorpions, metabolic rate-temperature (MRT) relationships varied substantially within and among individuals, and therefore had low repeatability values (τ = 0.02) and no significant among-individual variation (P = 0.181). However, acclimation resulted in a decline in within-individual variation of MRT slopes which subsequently revealed significant differences among individuals (P = 0.0031) and resulted in a fourfold increase in repeatability values (τ = 0.08). These results highlight the fact that MRT relationships can show substantial, directional variation within individuals over time. Using a randomization model we demonstrate that the reduction in metabolic rate with acclimation while body mass remains constant causes a decline both in the value of the mass-scaling exponent and the coefficient of determination. Furthermore, interspecific comparisons of activation energy, E, demonstrated significant variation in scorpions (0.09-1.14 eV), with a mean value of 0.77 eV, significantly higher than the 0.6-0.7 eV predicted by the fundamental equation. Our results add to a growing body of work questioning both the theoretical basis and empirical support for the MTE, and suggest that alternative models of metabolic rate variation incorporating explicit consideration of life history evolution deserve further scrutiny. © 2007 The Authors.},

Two experimental protocols of temporal variation were used. One group (six replicate lines) of populations evolved for 2,000 generations during exposure to a cycled regime fluctuating daily between pH 5.3 and 7.8. The other group (also in six replicate lines) evolved during exposure for 2,000 generations to a randomly shifting regime fluctuating stochastically each day among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8. Adaptation to these fluctuating acidity regimes was measured as a change in fitness relative to the common ancestor by direct competition experiments in both constant and fluctuating pH regimes. For comparisons with constant pH evolution, a group evolved at a constant pH of 5.3 and another group evolved at pH 7.8 were also tested. This study initiated the first long-term laboratory natural selection experiment on adaptation to variable acidity and addressed key questions concerning patterns of adaptation (trade-offs, specialists, generalists, plasticity, transitions, and acclimation) in temporally fluctuating environments. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={The environmental predictability (EP) hypothesis proposes that rapid cold hardening (RCH) might be common in temperate species incapable of surviving freezing events and which also dwell in unpredictable environments. The kelp fly Paractora dreuxi serves as a useful model organism to test this prediction at an intra-specific level because larvae and adults show different responses to low temperature despite occupying a similar unpredictable thermal environment. Here, using acclimation temperatures, which simulated seasonal temperature variation, we find little evidence for RCH in the freeze-intolerant adults but a limited RCH response in freeze-tolerant larvae. In the relatively short-lived adults, survival of -11 °C generally did not improve after 2 h pre-treatments at -4, -2, 0, 10, 20 or 25 °C either in summer- (10 °C) or winter (0 °C)-acclimated individuals. By contrast, survival of summer-acclimated larvae to -7.6 °C was significantly improved by ∼37% and 30% with -2 and 0 °C pre-treatments, respectively. The finding that summer-acclimated larvae showed RCH whereas this was not the case in the winter-acclimated larvae partially supports the predictions of the EP hypothesis. However, the EP hypothesis also predicts that the adults should have demonstrated an RCH response, yet they did not do so. Rather, it seems likely that they avoid stressful environments by behavioural thermoregulation. Differences in responses among the adults and larvae are therefore to some extent predictable from differences in their feeding requirements and behaviour. These results show that further studies of RCH should take into account the way in which differences among life stages influence the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and environmental variability and predictability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Environmental factors play an important role in the seasonal adaptation of body mass and thermogenesis in wild small mammals. In this study, we performed a factorial experiment (temperature x photoperiod) in which Brandt's voles and Mongolian gerbils were acclimated to different photoperiods (long photoperiod, 16L:8D; short photoperiod, 8L:16D) and temperatures (warm, 23°C; cold, 5°C) to test the hypothesis that photoperiod, temperature, or both together can trigger seasonal changes in serum leptin level, body mass, thermogenesis, and energy intake. Our data demonstrate that Brandt's voles showed a remarkable decrease in body mass in both the cold and a short photoperiod. However, no significant changes in body mass were found for gerbils exposed to similar conditions. The short photoperiod induced a decrease in serum leptin levels for both voles and gerbils that might contribute to an increase in energy intake. Furthermore, the short photoperiod induced an increase of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content for both voles and gerbils, and cold can further enhance the increase in voles. No interactions between photoperiod and temperature were detected for the two species. Brandt's voles can decrease their body mass through changes in energy intake and expenditure, while Mongolian gerbils can keep body mass relatively stable by balancing energy metabolism under winterlike conditions. Leptin was potentially involved in the regulation of body mass and thermogenic capacity for the two species. © 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Photoperiod and dietary lipids both influence thermal physiology and the pattern of torpor of heterothermic mammals. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that photoperiod-induced physiological changes are linked to differences in tissue fatty acid composition of deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus (∼18-g body mass). Deer mice were acclimated for >8 weeks to one of three photoperiods (LD, light/dark): LD 8:16 (short photoperiod), LD 12:12 (equinox photoperiod), and LD 16:8 (long photoperiod). Deer mice under short and equinox photoperiods showed a greater occurrence of torpor than those under long photoperiods (71, 70, and 14%, respectively). The duration of torpor bouts was longest in deer mice under short photoperiod (9.3 ± 2.6 h), intermediate under equinox photoperiod (5.1 ± 0.3 h), and shortest under long photoperiod (3.7 ± 0.6 h). Physiological differences in torpor use were associated with significant alterations of fatty acid composition in ∼50% of the major fatty acids from leg muscle total lipids, whereas white adipose tissue fatty acid composition showed fewer changes. Our results provide the first evidence that physiological changes due to photoperiod exposure do result in changes in lipid composition in the muscle tissue of deer mice and suggest that these may play a role in survival of low body temperature and metabolic rate during torpor, thus, enhancing favourable energy balance over the course of the winter. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Studies of locomotor performance have contributed to the elucidation of how suborganismal traits ultimately relate to fitness. In terrestrial populations, exploring the physiological and environmental contributions to whole-animal performance measures has improved our understanding of phenotypic selection. Conversely, very little is known about the links between phenotypic selection and swimming abilities in fish. Most research on swimming performance in fish has focused on morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits contributing to performance or has used swimming performance as a measure of environmental suitability. Few studies have explored how swimming performance is integrated with life-history traits or contributes to Darwinian fitness. In addition, while there are many studies on how the environment influences the swimming performance of fish, few have been done at the individual level. The objective of this study was to broaden our understanding of the relevance of fish swimming performance studies by testing the hypothesis that swimming performance (endurance and sprint) is ontogenetically and temporally stable across fluctuating environmental conditions. We found that individual sprint performances recorded at 12°C were significantly repeatable after a 4-wk acclimation to 22°C, although relative sprint performance of fish that survived 6 mo of natural conditions in a mesocosm was not significantly repeatable. Endurance swimming performance, as measured by critical swimming speed (Ucrit) before and after the 6-mo exposure to simulated natural conditions, was significantly repeatable within survivors. Relative sprint and critical swimming performances were not significantly related to each other. We concluded that within a time frame of up to 6 mo, the swimming performances of individual bass are ontogenetically nearly stable (sprint) to stable (endurance) despite large fluctuations in environmental conditions. Moreover, because they rely on different physiological performance traits, critical swimming and sprinting follow different patterns of change. This observation suggests the absence of a trade-off between these two swimming modes and introduces the possibly of independent selection trajectories. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={We examined the relative importance of behavioral thermoregulation and metabolic compensation used by a subtropical rhacophorid (Polypedates megacephalus) tadpoles living in man-made container habitats to cope with thermal stress. We collected foam nests of P. megacephalus from man-made container habitats, and hatchlings were raised in 150 or 15 L of water (LWB and SWB containers, respectively). Water and air temperatures of containers were monitored using a datalogger. Tadpoles from both types of containers were acclimated at 22 and 32 °C for 10 d before measuring oxygen consumption (V ̇O2) in a closed-system at 22, 27, and 32 °C. Thermal selection of tadpoles from two containers was determined using an aquatic thermal gradient. We observed daily stratification of temperature in the water column of LWB containers but not SWB containers. Tadpoles from LWB and SWB containers exhibited metabolic compensation so that tadpoles acclimated to 22 °C had significantly higher V ̇O2 than those acclimated to 32 °C. This was probably related to the variation of environmental temperature experienced by the tadpoles. Tadpoles of LWB and SWB containers selected similar water temperatures with low coefficient of variation, suggesting they are good thermal selectors. Results of this study suggest that P. megacephalus tadpoles use both behavioral thermoregulation and metabolic compensation to cope with the environmental temperature fluctuation, and this is, in part, due to the heterogeneity in the thermal regimes of breeding habitats. Even though metabolic compensation of tadpoles incurs a cost, P. megacephalus tadpoles that experience no daily thermal gradient in the man-made water bodies and/or seasonal variations in temperature over tadpole period evolve metabolic compensation to maintain physiological homeostasis under different thermal regimes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={How animals adaptively respond to a cold or hot environment has been questioned for a long time. Recently, with the aid of microarray analysis, various temperature-sensitive genes have been identified in several species. However, a definitive hypothesis regarding the mechanism of adaptation has not been proposed. In the present study, we surveyed, in medaka (Oryzias latipes), genes for which the level of expression changes depending on the surrounding temperature. A messenger RNA differential display of medaka muscle total RNA revealed one such gene encoding transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1). In medaka muscle, the TEF-1 gene produces two splicing variants, TEF-1A and TEF-1B mRNAs. During cold acclimation, the mRNA level of TEF-1A decreased, whereas that of TEF-1B increased. We also found that three putative downstream genes of TEF-1, two for myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and one for troponin T (TnT), a specific group of muscle proteins, were transcribed in a temperature-dependent manner. These results suggest that the transcription of MyHC and/or TnT is regulated by TEF-1 and that these molecules participate in muscle reconstruction during temperature adaptation in fish. © 2006 Zoological Society of Japan.},

abstract={Cadmium and temperature have strong impacts on the metabolic physiology of aquatic organisms. To analyze the combined impact of these two stressors on aerobic capacity, effects of Cd exposure (50 μg/L) on mitochondrial function were studied in oysters (Crassostrea virginica) acclimated to 12 and 20°C in winter and to 20 and 28°C in fall. Cadmium exposure had different effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics of oysters depending on the acclimation temperature. In oysters acclimated to 12°C, Cd exposure resulted in elevated intrinsic rates of mitochondrial oxidation, whereas at 28°C, a rapid and pronounced decrease of mitochondrial oxidative capacity was found in Cd-exposed oysters. At the intermediate acclimation temperature (20°C), effects of Cd exposure on intrinsic rates of mitochondrial oxidation were negligible. Degree of coupling significantly decreased in mitochondria from 28°C-acclimated oysters but not in that from 12°C- or 20°C-acclimated oysters. Acclimation at elevated temperatures also increased sensitivity of oyster mitochondria to extramitochondrial Cd. Variation in mitochondrial membrane potential explained 41% of the observed variation in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis and proton leak between different acclimation groups of oysters. Temperature-dependent sensitivity of metabolic physiology to Cd has significant implications for toxicity testing and for extrapolation of laboratory studies to field populations of aquatic poikilotherms, indicating the importance of taking into account the thermal regime of the environment. © 2006 SETAC.},

abstract={Changes in photoperiod, ambient temperature and food availability trigger seasonal acclimatization in physiology and behavior of many animals. In the present study, seasonal adjustments in body mass and in several physiological, hormonal, and biochemical markers were examined in wild-captured plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Our results showed that plateau pikas maintained a relatively constant body mass throughout the year and showed no seasonal changes in body fat mass and circulating levels of serum leptin. However, nonshivering thermogenesis, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) contents in brown adipose tissues were significantly enhanced in winter. Further, serum leptin levels were positively correlated with body mass and body fat mass while negatively correlated with UCP1 contents. Together, these data suggest that plateau pikas mainly depend on increasing thermogenic capacities, rather than decreasing body mass, to cope with cold, and leptin may play a potential role in their thermogenesis and body mass regulation. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Variation in 19 traits possibly relevant for thermal adaptation was studied in 11 populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected in southeast Australia. Using stepwise multiple regression, the variation was compared to variation in geographic coordinates and to a set of climatic variables estimated for each collection site. For 13 of the traits, a significant part of the variation was explained by climatic variables and/or geographic coordinates, suggesting directional selection for adaptation to the environment in the majority of traits studied. In 10 of the traits, both geographic coordinates and climatic variables explained significant proportions of the variation, with R2 ranging from 0.075 to 0.58. Although larvae, pupae and adults of D. buzzatii share a common habitat, the measured traits were not correlated across life stages and gender. Also, there seemed to be special conditions in marginal populations near species borders, giving rise to nonlinear relations with latitude. Climate apparently does influence the adaptive evolution of the traits studied, but they also are affected by other factors that vary with latitude, longitude and distance to coast. These results highlight the complex challenges imposed by the environment on the adaptive process. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recent reviews of the adaptive hypotheses for animal responses to acclimation have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between developmental and adult (non-developmental) phenotypic plasticity. There has been little work, however, on separating the effects of developmental plasticity from adult acclimation on physiological traits. Therefore, we investigated the relative contributions of these two distinct forms of plasticity to the environmental physiology of adult tsetse flies by exposing developing pupae or adult flies to different temperatures and comparing their responses. We also exposed flies to different temperatures during development and reexposed them as adults to the same temperatures, to investigate possible cumulative effects. Critical thermal maxima were relatively inflexible in response to acclimation temperatures (21, 25, 29°C) with plasticity type accounting for the majority of the variation (49-67%, nested ANOVA). By contrast, acclimation had a larger effect on critical thermal minima with treatment temperature accounting for most of the variance (84-92%). Surprisingly little of the variance in desiccation rate could be explained by plasticity type (30-47%). The only significant effect of acclimation temperature on standard (resting) metabolic rate of adult flies was at 21°C, resulting in treatment temperature, rather than plasticity type, accounting for the majority of the variance (30-76%). This study demonstrates that the stage at which acclimation takes place has significant, though often different, effects on several adult physiological traits in G. pallidipes, and therefore that it is not only important to consider the form of plasticity but also the direction of the response and its significance from a life-history perspective.},

abstract={The subject of this review is the impact of long-term changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between temperature-mediated changes in net assimilation rates (NAR) and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area (SLA)] when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of temperature-mediated changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining NAR values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in RGR, SLA, and NAR than slow-growing plants. For RGR and NAR, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i.e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater temperature-mediated changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, SLA was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in NAR account for an increasing proportion of variability in RGR as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, SLA played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in RGR at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of SLA in determining interspecific variation in RGR could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future. © The Author [2005].

abstract={• Freezing sensitivity of leaves and xylem was examined in four co-occurring Mediterranean oaks (Quercus spp.) grown in a common garden to determine whether freezing responses of leaves and xylem were coordinated and could be predicted by leaf lifespan. • Freezing-induced embolism and loss of photosynthetic function were measured after overnight exposure to a range of subzero temperatures in both summer and winter. • Both measures were found to be dependent on minimum freezing temperature and were correlated with leaf lifespan and vessel diameter. The dependence of xylem embolism on minimum freezing temperature may result from the decline in water potential with ice temperature that influences the redistribution of water during freezing and leads to an increase in xylem tension. Winter acclimatization had a relatively small effect on the vulnerability to freezing-induced embolism, although leaf photosynthetic function showed a strong acclimatization response, particularly in the two evergreen species. • Quercus ilex, the species with the longest leaf lifespan and narrowest vessel diameters, showed the highest freezing tolerance. This helps explain its ability to inhabit a broad range throughout the Mediterranean region. By contrast, the inability of the deciduous oaks to maintain photosynthetic and vascular function throughout the winter indicates a competitive disadvantage that may prevent them from expanding their ranges. © New Phytologist (2005).},

abstract={We investigated the mechanism of the enhancement of twitch force by stretch and the effects of temperature on it in nerve-skeletal muscle preparations of whole iliofibularis muscles isolated from the frog Rana brevipoda. When a preparation was stimulated indirectly and stretched, the twitch force after the stretch was enhanced remarkably in comparison to that observed before a stretch at low temperature. The enhanced force obtained by a stretch of 20% resting muscle length (l0) at low temperature was as high as the force obtained by direct stimulation. The phenomenon was not dependent on the velocity but on the amplitude of stretch. The enhanced force obeyed the length-force relationship when a stretch was long enough. The above results were observed when the frogs were kept at room temperature (20-22°C). Measurements were also taken at low temperature (4°C); when frogs were kept at low temperature for more than 2 months, twitch force obtained without stretch was considerably higher at l0. The amplitude of the action potential recorded extracellularly from the muscle surface increased remarkably after a stretch, but was same before and after a stretch when recorded from the nerve innervating muscle. The effects of temperature on twitch and tetanic force by direct or indirect stimulation without stretch were also studied as basic data of the stretch experiment. The results from this study suggest that stretch-induced force enhancement in a nerve-muscle preparation is caused by an increase in the transmission rate between nerve and muscle, and the amplitude of the enhanced force is determined by the length-force relationship of the muscle. The phenomenon is also strongly affected by the temperature at which the frogs are kept.},

A synthesis of the results shows a biphasic acclimatory profile of VTsh, STsh, and transcript levels of all studied genes, with transient up/down-regulatory changes on STHA. AngII affected the physiological integrative outcome primarily during euhydration, although AT membranal changes (except in LTHA) were confined to hypohydration. 7NI had an impact during hypohydration. Evidence is provided that AngII and 7NI modulate thermoregulation primarily via AT 1 and AT 2 receptors, with predominance of AT 2 signaling following LTHA and/or hypohydration, opposing a drop in AT 1-mediated thresholds. The final shaping of AngII signaling depends on cross-talk between nNOS and AngII receptors at both molecular and protein levels. Hypohydration induces transcriptional responses but desensitizes AngII receptors signaling, attenuating their effect on VTsh and STsh, and abolishing the beneficial thermoregulatory effects achieved by heat acclimation. nNOS, AngII receptor-independent pathway is also implicated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that temperature acclimation modifies sarcolemmal Na+ current (INa) of the fish cardiac myocytes differently depending on the animal's lifestyle in the cold. Two eurythermal fish species with different physiological strategies for surviving in the cold, a cold-dormant crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.) and a cold-active rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were used in acclimation experiments. The INa of carp and trout were also compared with I Na of a cold stenothermal burbot (Lota lota). In accordance with the hypothesis, cold-acclimation decreased the density of INa in crucian carp and increased it in rainbow trout, suggesting depression of impulse conduction in cold-acclimated carp and positive compensation of impulse propagation in cold-acclimated trout. The steady-state activation curve of trout INa was shifted by 6 mV to more negative voltages by cold acclimation, which probably lowers the stimulus threshold for action potentials and further improves cardiac excitability in the cold. In burbot myocytes, the INa density was high and the position of the steady-state activation curve on the voltage axis was even more negative than in trout or carp myocytes, suggesting that the burbot INa is adapted to maintain high excitability and conductivity in the cold. The INa of the burbot heart differed from those of carp and trout in causing four times larger charge influx per excitation, which suggests that INa may also have a significant role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling of the burbot heart. In summary, INa of fish cardiac myocytes shows thermal plasticity that is different in several respects in cold-dormant and cold-active species and thus has a physiologically meaningful role in supporting the variable life styles and habitat conditions of each species.},

abstract={We studied the blood flow over dorsal and abdominal, non-brooding patch skin of two groups of pigeons: one group was thermally acclimated to cold (winter-acclimatized, WAC) while the other group was acclimated to a mesic environment (thermally non-challenged, NOC). Two bilateral patches at the measurement sites were treated simultaneously with a gel containing sodium nitrate and ascorbic acid, to generate nitric oxide (NO), and a vehicle gel. Blood flow was measured by laser Doppler velocimetry. Changes induced by these treatments were calculated against basic blood flow values for the corresponding patch. The results showed that the basic blood flow over the abdominal skin patches at room temperature was higher than over the dorsal skin in both acclimation states, but comparison revealed a sustainably higher level of basic skin blood flow in the WAC pigeons. The local response to exogenous NO was non-uniform over the two skin areas measured, and a specific vasodilatory action on the abdominal microvessels was recorded in the NOC pigeons. Abdominal vasodilatation in the WAC pigeons seemed to involve other mechanisms as well as local NO-dependent ones, among which the role of cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD) is discussed here. Interestingly, the dorsal skin seemed to be less responsive to the action of NO, irrespective of the acclimation state. Our results show that acclimation state and skin site affect the action of exogenous NO on local skin blood flow, and we suggest that the differences reflect acclimation-induced changes in the vascularity of the skin and in its sensitivity to thermal stimuli and that the roles of the abdominal and dorsal skin are different with respect to environmental changes.},

abstract={We investigated changes in the relative contributions of respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL) and cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL) to total evaporative water loss (TEWL) in response to short-term thermal acclimation in western white-winged doves Zenaida asiatica mearnsii. We measured REWL, CEWL, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in a partitioned chamber using flow-through respirometry. In doves housed for 2-4 weeks in a room heated to ca. 43°C during the day, TEWL increased from 5.5±1.3 mg g-1 h-1 at an air temperature (T a) of 35°C to 19.3±2.5 mg g-1 h-1 at Ta=45°C. In doves housed at room temperature for the same period, TEWL increased from 4.6±1.1 mg g-1 h-1 at Ta=35°C to 16.1±4.6 mg g-1 h-1 at Ta=45°C. The CEWL of heat-acclimated doves increased from 3.6±1.2 mg g-1 h-1 (64% of TEWL) at 35°C to 15.0±2.1 mg g-1 h-1 (78% of TEWL) at T a=45°C. Cool-acclimated doves exhibited more modest increases in CEWL, from 2.7±0.7 mg g-1 h-1 at T a=35°C to 7.8±3.4 mg g-1 h-1 at Ta=45°C, with the contribution of CEWL to TEWL averaging 53% over this Ta range. Cool-acclimated doves became mildly hyperthermic (body temperature Tb=42.9±0.4°C) and expended 35% more energy relative to heat-acclimated doves (Tb=41.9±0.6°C) at Ta=45°C, even though TEWL in the two groups was similar. In each of the two groups, metabolic rate did not vary with Ta, and averaged 7.1±0.5 mW g-1 in cool-acclimated doves and 6.3±0.8 mW g-1 in heat-acclimated doves. The differences in TEWL partitioning we observed between the two experimental groups resulted from a consistently lower skin water vapour diffusion resistance (rv) in the heat-acclimated doves. At Ta=45°C, rv in the cool-acclimated doves was 120±81 s cm-1, whereas r v in the heat-acclimated doves was 38±8 s cm-1. Our data reveal that in Z. a. mearnsii, TEWL partitioning varies in response to short-term thermal acclimation.},

abstract={Thermal acclimation in small endotherms provides an excellent model for the study of physiological plasticity, as energy requirements can be easily manipulated and the results are relevant for natural conditions. Nevertheless, how physiology changes throughout acclimation, and how individuals vary in their response to acclimation, remain poorly understood. Here we describe a high temporalresolution study of cold acclimation in the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus. The experimental design was based on repeated measures at short intervals throughout cold acclimation, with controls (maintained at constant temperature) for measurement artifacts. We monitored body mass, maximum metabolic rate in cold exposure and ventilatory traits (respiratory frequency, tidal and minute volume and oxygen extraction) for 3 weeks at 23°C. Then, half of the individuals were held for 7 weeks at 5°C. Body mass was differently affected by cold acclimation depending on sex. Maximal metabolism (V̇O2max) increased significantly during the first week of cold acclimation, 'overshot' after 5 weeks and dropped to a plateau about 34% above control values at week 7. Similarly, ventilatory traits increased during cold acclimation, though responses were different in their kinetics and magnitude. Body mass, maximum metabolism, and most ventilatory traits were repeatable after 7 weeks in control and cold-acclimated animals. However, repeatability tended to be lower in the cold-acclimated group, especially while animals were still acclimating. Our results show that acclimation effects may be under- and/or overestimated, depending on when trials are performed, and that different traits respond differently, and at different rates, to acclimation. Hence, future studies should be designed to ensure that animals have attained steady-state values in acclimation experiments.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the effects of seasonal temperature variation on the functional properties of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from white muscle and liver of Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua) and the possible relevance of LDH allelic variability for thermal acclimation. Two groups of fishes were acclimated to 4°C or 12°C for one year. Polymorphism was observed in only one (Ldh-B) of the three Ldh loci expressed in cod liver and/ or muscle. Isozyme expression remained unchanged regardless of acclimation temperature (TA.). The products of locus Ldh-B comprise only 14-19% (depending on the tissue) of total LDH activities and, consequently, differences between phenotypes are negligible in terms of their effect on LDH total performance. No kinetic (KmPYR, Ksi PYR, Vmax) or thermodynamic (Ea, ΔG) differences were found among Ldh-B phenotypes. Clear kinetic differences were observed between LDH isoforms in the two tissues. However, the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) for pyruvate reduction was the same for both tissues (Ea=47 kJ mol-1) at TA=12°C. Factors TA, tissue and phenotype did not reveal a significant effect on the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the reaction (55.5 kj mol -1). However, at TA=4°C, the Ea was increased (Ea=53-S6 kj mol-1) and the temperature dependence of the constant of substrate inhibition for pyruvate (K siPYR) decreased in both muscle and liver. In conclusion, the strategies of LDH adjustment to seasonal temperature variations in cod involve changes in LDH concentration (quantitative), adjustment of thermodynamic (Ea) and kinetic (KsiPYR) properties of the LDH (modulative) but not the expression of alternative isoforms (qualitative). We assume that the observed increase in Ea and the decrease of temperature dependence of KsiPYR at low TA is the result of structural changes of the LDH molecule (temperature-driven protein folding). We propose a new mechanism of metabolic compensation of seasonal temperature variations - cold acclimation results in changes in the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of LDH in a way that favours aerobic metabolism through reduction of the competition of LDH for pyruvate in normoxic conditions.},

abstract={The time course of changes in the properties of mitochondria from oxidative muscle of rainbow trout was examined during warm (15°C) and cold (5°C) acclimation. Mitochondrial oxidative capacities showed a biphasic response during thermal acclimation: at a given assay temperature, capacities first increased and then decreased during warm acclimation and showed the inverse pattern during cold acclimation. This was most apparent for maximal rates of state 3 oxygen consumption expressed per mg mitochondrial protein. Rates expressed per nmol ADP-ATP translocase (ANT) showed this pattern during cold acclimation. A biphasic pattern was also apparent for state 4 and oligomycin-inhibited (state 4ol) rates of oxygen uptake expressed per mg protein. Changes in states 4 and 4ol were smaller during cold than warm acclimation. Warm acclimation reduced the proportion of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase needed during mitochondrial substrate oxidation. Phospholipid concentrations per mg mitochondrial protein changed little with thermal acclimation. Mitochondrial properties changed more quickly during warm than cold acclimation. While the biochemical modifications during thermal acclimation may eventually compensate for the thermal change, compensation did not occur at its onset. Rather, the initial changes of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in response to temperature change accentuated the functional impact of the thermal change, and prolonged exposure to the new temperature was required to attain a degree of thermal compensation.},

abstract={Marsupials, unlike placental mammals, are believed to be unable to increase heat production and thermal performance after cold-acclimation. It has been suggested that this may be because marsupials lack functional brown fat, a thermogenic tissue, which proliferates during cold-acclimation in many placentals. However, arid zone marsupials have to cope with unpredictable, short-term and occasionally extreme changes in environmental conditions, and thus they would benefit from an appropriate physiological response. We therefore investigated whether a sequential two to four week acclimation in Sminthopsis macroura (body mass approx. 25 g) to both cold (16°C) and warm (26°C) ambient temperatures affects the thermal physiology of the species. Cold-acclimated S. macroura were able to significantly increase maximum heat production (by 27%) and could maintain a constant body temperature at significantly lower effective ambient temperatures (about 9°C lower) than when warm-acclimated. Moreover, metabolic rates during torpor were increased following cold-acclimation in comparison to warm-acclimation. Our study shows that, despite the lack of functional brown fat, short-term acclimation can have significant effects on thermoenergetics of marsupials. It is likely that the rapid response in S. macroura reflects an adaptation to the unpredictability of the climate in their habitat.},

abstract={Temperature acclimation may be a critical component of the locomotor physiology and ecology of ectothermic animals, particularly those living in eurythermal environments. Several studies of fish report striking acclimation of biochemical and kinetic properties in isolated muscle. However, the relatively few studies of whole-animal performance report variable acclimation responses. We test the hypothesis that different types of whole-animal locomotion will respond differently to temperature acclimation, probably due to divergent physiological bases of locomotion. We studied two cyprinid fishes, tinfoil barbs (Puntius schwanenfeldii) and river barbels (Barbus barbus). Study fish were acclimated to either cold or warm temperatures for at least 6 wk and then assayed at four test temperatures for three types of swimming performance. We measured voluntary swimming velocity to estimate routine locomotor behavior, maximum fast start velocity to estimate anaerobic capacity, and critical swimming velocity to estimate primarily aerobic capacity. All three performance measures showed some acute thermal dependence, generally a positive correlation between swimming speed and test temperature. However, each performance measure responded quite differently to acclimation. Critical speeds acclimated strongly, maximum speeds not at all, and voluntary speeds uniquely in each species. Thus we conclude that long-term temperature exposure can have very different consequences for different types of locomotion, consistent with our hypothesis. The data also address previous hypotheses that predict that polyploid and eurythermal fish will have greater acclimation abilities than other fish, due to increased genetic flexibility and ecological selection, respectively. Our results conflict with these predictions. River barbels are eurythermal polyploids and tinfoil barbs stenothermal diploids, yet voluntary swimming acclimated strongly in tinfoil barbs and minimally in river barbels, and acclimation was otherwise comparable.},

abstract={For most teleost fish, the majority of the myocardial oxygen supply is provided by the oxygen reserve remaining in venous blood after other tissues have extracted oxygen. We examined the effect of graded exercise and water temperature on this venous blood oxygen supply to the heart (termed the cardiac circulation) by performing novel on-line measurements of venous partial pressure of oxygen (PvO2) using a fibreoptic micro-optode implanted in the ductus Cuvier of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). As expected, PvO2 decreased progressively and significantly as swimming velocity approached the critical swimming speed (Ucrit). Unsteady swimming behaviours during the graded exercise, however, caused abrupt and generally short-lived decreases in PvO2. For the cold-acclimated (6-10°C) fish, PvO2 reached a minimum plateau value of 15.3±3.7 torr (1torr=133.3Pa) before Ucrit was reached, and so increased swimming effort near to Ucrit did not reduce PvO2 further. Warm-acclimated fish had a significantly higher PvO2 (28.9±3.5 torr) at Ucrit. Despite this difference in the PvO2 at Ucrit, we estimated that there was little difference between warm- and cold-acclimated fish in terms of oxygen supply in the cardiac circulation because of a right-shift in the haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve at warm temperatures. Furthermore, although PvO2 decreased significantly at Ucrit, our estimates suggest that the expected increase in cardiac output would easily maintain the oxygen supply in venous blood at a level similar to that found in resting fish. Although unsteady swimming behaviours decreased PvO2, unsteady swimming rarely decreased the minimum PvO2 value observed at Ucrit by more than 10%. The findings are discussed in terms of a threshold PvO2 required to maintain adequate rates of oxygen diffusion from the cardiac circulation to the myocardial tissues.},

abstract={Because the term stress is used, most often subjectively, with various meanings, this paper first attempts to clarify the physiological definition, and the appropriate terms as responses in different situations. The flexibility of normal metabolism allows the development of responses to environmental changes which fluctuate regularly and predictably over daily and seasonal cycles. Thus every deviation of a factor from its optimum does not necessarily result in stress. Stress begins with a constraint or with highly unpredictable fluctuations imposed on regular metabolic patterns that cause bodily injury, disease, or aberrant physiology. Stress is the altered physiological condition caused by factors that tend to alter an equilibrium. Strain is any physical and/or chemical change produced by a stress, i.e. every established condition, which forces a system away from its thermodynamic optimal state. The paper secondly summarises the Strasser's state-change concept which is precisely that suboptimality is the driving force for acclimation (genotype level) or adaptation (population level) to stress. The paper continues with the actual knowledge on the mechanisms of stress recognition and cell signalling. Briefly: plasma membranes are the sensors of environmental changes; phytohormones and second messengers are the transducers of information from membranes to metabolism; carbon balance is the master integrator of plant response; betwixt and between, some genes are expressed more strongly, whereas others are repressed. Reactive oxygen species play key roles in up- and down-regulation of metabolism and structure. The paper shows finally that the above concepts can be applied to plant tissue cultures where the accumulating physiological and genetical deviations (from a normal plant behaviour) are related to the stressing conditions of the in vitro culture media and of the confined environment. The hyperhydrated state of shoots and the cancerous state of cells, both induced under conditions of stress in vitro cultures, are identified and detailed, because they perfectly illustrate the stress-induced state-change concept. It is concluded that stress responses include either pathologies or adaptive advantages.

abstract={Previous estimates suggested that ventilatory evaporation constitutes the major source of water loss in kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.). We quantified rates of water loss in Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) and demonstrate the degree to which acclimation to a particular thermal and hydric environment plays a role in the intraspecific variation in water loss evident in this species. We draw the following conclusions: (1) that water loss varies intraspecifically in Merriam's kangaroo rat, in association with habitats of contrasting aridity and temperature; (2) that animals from more xeric locations have lower water loss rates than those from more mesic sites; (3) that most water loss is cutaneous, with ventilatory evaporative water loss contributing, at most, only 44 % to total evaporative water loss; and (4) that intraspecific differences in rates of water loss are not acclimatory, but fixed. After acclimating under the same conditions, xeric-site animals still show a 33 % lower rate of evaporative water loss than mesic-site animals.},

abstract={Variation in physiological response during autumn acclimation was investigated in somatic seedlings of 10 interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss×P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) clones from five full-sib families. Experiments were conducted on 2-yr-old seedlings through simulation in a growth chamber. Throughout the experimental period, gas-exchange parameters (net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance to water vapour and instantaneous water-use efficiency) were measured weekly and freezing tolerance was determined five times. Results showed that as seedlings acclimated to decreasing air temperature and photoperiod, stomatal conductance decreased linearly, photosynthesis was unchanged until air temperature and photoperiod were below 10 °C and 11 h, respectively, water-use efficiency nearly doubled and freezing tolerance increased in a curvilinear fashion. There was significant between- and within-family clonal variation in all of these physiological parameters.

abstract={Short- and long-term effects of temperature on ion flux and energy turnover were studied in hepatocytes from thermally acclimated trout and roach. In trout hepatocytes K+ efflux was insensitive towards acute exposure to low temperature but was downregulated during cold acelimation of the fish so as to balance the uncompeusated decreased K+(Rb+) uptake of the cells. In contrast, both K+(Rb+) uptake and K+ efflux of roach hepatocytes were temperature sensitive in the short term. These acute effects, however, were offset during cold acclimation by a near perfect compensation of both fluxes leading to re-establishment of ion flux homeostasis at the original level. Our findings, based on a new method permitting the simultaneous monitoring of K+ efflux and uptake in the same cell population, provide experimental verification of two of the three possible strategies, recently discussed by Cossins et al. (1995), by which the ionic steady state of fish cells may adjust to acute and chronic temperature change. By comparing hepatocytes from two groups of trout, one kept on a maintenance diet (ration I), the other fed ad libitum (ration II), we discovered striking effects of nutritional state on the absolute levels as well as on the temperature relationships of K+ uptake and protein synthetic activity. Both of these functions in the hepatocytes increased in the ration II fed as compared to the ration I fed trouts, but the increase of protein synthetic activity was greater and more uniform at the three experimental temperatures than that of K+ uptake. Moreover, protein synthetic activity proved to be considerably more temperature sensitive than K+ uptakeand, in contrast to the latter, showed a compensatory response after cold acclimation.},

abstract={The processes of acclimation to hot-dry and to warm-humid climates were studied using two approaches: a quantitative analysis of literature data and an experimental study in the laboratory concerning the physiological parameters of heart rate, rectal temperature, sweat loss, and subjective assessment. Analysis o f literature data: Data from 62 experiments with a total of 813 participants were pooled and recalculated. The experiments ranged from 6 to 24 days, air temperatures from 30.4 to 50.0 °C, water vapor pressures from 1.5 to 6.5 kPa, and wet bulb globe temperatures (WBGT) from 27.4 to 38.6 °C. Laboratory studies: In the laboratory, 8 participants were acclimated during 15 consecutive days to a hot-dry climate and to a warm-humid climate, which were equivalent in terms of the WBGT (33.5 and 33.6 °C, respectively). The participants walked four times for 25 min on a treadmill at a speed of 4 km/h. The hot-dry climate caused somewhat greater strain than the warm-humid condition. In the course of acclimation to the hot-dry climate, heart rate and rectal temperature started at higher levels, decreased slightly steeper but remained on a higher level throughout. Nevertheless, the differences between both thermal conditions were small, and both physiologic functions reached the point of acclimation almost at the same time under warm-humid and under hot-dry exposure. Sweat loss, which is not regarded as a valid predictor for acclimation, was considerably higher but increased less in the hot-dry than in the warm-humid climate. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Temperature and salinity significantly (P&lt;0.05) affected metabolic rates of L. variegatus plutei. These results show that L. variegatus larvae are stenohaline when compared to larvae of other echinoderm species.

abstract={The effect of short photoperiod and cold on metabolism and thermoregulation was investigated in pouched mice (Saccostomus campestris: Cricetidae) from three localities in southern Africa which experience contrasting climatic conditions. Mice were initially acclimated to long photoperiod (14L: 10D) at 25°C, followed first by a decline in photoperiod (to 10L: 14D) and then by a fall in temperature (to 10°C). Minimum observed metabolic rate (≡basal metabolic rate) was unaffected by the decline in photoperiod but increased significantly following cold acclimation. Because minimal thermal conductance remained constant throughout the study the increase in minimum observed metabolic rate caused a decline in lower critical temperature to around 26°C. In contrast to minimum observed metabolic rate, regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis improved significantly following the decline in both photoperiod and temperature. However, pouched mice from the warmest locality were significantly less responsive to photoperiod than those from the other two localities whose survival might depend upon their ability to accurately predict seasonal changes in temperature. Neither photoperiod nor temperature had any effect on body mass, yet pouched mice from the most arid locality, where food supply might be unpredictable, were significantly smaller and had lower total energy requirements than those from areas experiencing higher annual rainfall. These results indicate that S. campestris displays considerable geographical variation in energy requirements together with differences in the use of photoperiod as an anticipatory cue for predicting the onset of winter. These differences appear to be related to the availability of energy and the relative severity of climatic conditions in each locality. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Heat acclimation is shown to result in the decrease in the intensity of thermal selection which is more evident at the lower as compared with higher heat doses. Heat acclimation is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the genetic effectiveness of thermal selection. Therefore the directed selection of individuals turns into a poorly selective or even completely non-selective order of death. This effect is achieved in three ways: (1) a decrease in individual variability of organismal heat resistance. (2) a decrease in the heritability of this trait and (3) a change in the order of death of individuals during thermal selection (rearrangement of selectivity). The change in the intensity (δi) and genetic effectiveness (δE) of thermal selection due to the effect of acclimation demonstrates a functional homeostasis of the population. This homeostatic mechanism maintains population numerical composition and genetic structure under conditions of variable temperature. This can be expressed as follows: H = 1 - δi·δE where H is the level of homeostasis, δi is the organismal and δE the populational components of the total homeostasis. © 1978.},
