AB The formulation presented in this paper is based on the boundary element
   method (BEM) and implements Kirchhoff's decomposition into viscous,
   thermal, and acoustic components, which can be treated independently
   everywhere in the domain except on the boundaries. The acoustic
   variables with losses are solved using extended boundary conditions that
   assume (i) negligible temperature fluctuations at the boundary and (ii)
   normal and tangential matching of the boundary's particle velocity. The
   proposed model does not require constructing a special mesh for the
   viscous and thermal boundary layers as is the case with the existing
   finite element method (FEM) implementations with losses. The suitability
   of this approach is demonstrated using an axisymmetrical BEM and two
   test cases where the numerical results are compared with analytical
   solutions. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Geographical variation in environmental temperatures is expected to
   impose clinal phenotypic selection that results in the expression of
   large-scale gradients of body mass variation within animal clades. Body
   size is predicted to increase with increasing latitude and elevation,
   and hence, with decreasing temperature, a pattern broadly known as
   Bergmann's rule. However, empirical observations are highly conflicting.
   Whilst most studies support this prediction in endotherms (birds and
   mammals), analyses conducted on ectotherms often fail to report this
   pattern. Does it reduce the validity of this macroecological rule? Since
   the original formulation of Bergmann's rule only involved endothermic
   organisms, I argue that the controversy is not a consequence of its
   predictive power, but a result of the later inclusion of ectotherms as
   part of the prediction. Here, I propose that the common conception of
   Bergmann's rule maintained for half a century is changed back to its
   original definition restricted to endotherms. This temperature-size
   relationship might therefore consolidate as a well-established
   macroecological rule if its original formulation is respected. Finally,
   I develop these claims on my initial suggestion that Bergmann's rule
   should be recognized as the evolutionary outcome of a general process
   with no phylogenetic scale distinction of species or populations, being
   equally applicable amongst and within species.

AB AimOur aim was to document geographical patterns of variation in the
   body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages along abiotic
   gradients, and any differences in fish assemblage structure. We
   hypothesized that patterns in the body-size structure of entire lake
   fish assemblages are primarily temperature driven and consistent with
   the dominant pattern of the temperature-size rule, which suggests a
   decrease in adult body size with increasing developmental temperature
   for many ectothermic species.
   Location356 European lakes.
   MethodsVariation in the body-size structure of fish assemblages was
   explored on a continental scale along gradients of temperature,
   morphometry, productivity and fish assemblage structure for 356 European
   lakes. The mean fish assemblage body-size and individual body-size
   distributions were selected as size metrics. Separate analyses were
   conducted for lakes located within five ecoregion subsets (Borealic
   Uplands/Tundra, FennoScandian Shield, Central Plains, Western Plains and
   Western Highlands) and for lakes with different functional fish
   classifications (cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages).
   ResultsGeographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of
   European lake fish assemblages could be clearly discerned along a
   temperature gradient for both the continental dataset (356 lakes) and
   the smaller geographical (ecoregion) subsets. We found systematic
   changes in fish assemblage body-size structure across temperature
   gradients in correspondence with the dominant thermal fish guild. The
   majority of the lakes, mainly located in the warmer European lowlands,
   were dominated by eurythermic cool- and warmwater fish assemblages, with
   smaller sized individuals characterized by linear individual body-size
   distributions. Lakes located in colder regions and dominated by
   stenothermic coldwater salmonids with larger sized individuals were
   characterized by unimodal or bimodal size distributions. The mean body
   size of cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages changed uniformly
   along the temperature gradient.
   Main conclusionsPatterns of variation in the body-size structure of
   European lake fish assemblages are consistent with the temperature-size
   rule. Temperature modifies fish assemblage size structure uniformly
   within the thermal fish guilds and in different ecoregions. Furthermore,
   our results indicate an increasing predictive power of temperature to
   explain variability in body-size structure when moving from warmer to
   colder geographical regions.

AB The effect of seawater (sw) on plasma ion concentrations and critical
   swimming velocity (U(crit)) was investigated in hatchery-reared coho
   salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) parr exposed to one of four treatments: 24
   h of seawater exposure (SW1), 5-7 d of seawater (SW5), 24 h in seawater
   followed by 24 h in fresh water (SW-FW), and a freshwater control (FWC).
   Only the SW1 fish demonstrated a reduced U(crit) and, at rest, elevated
   plasma [Na+], [Cl-], and [SO4(-2)]. With exercise, SW1 fish were
   characterized by an increase in plasma ion concentrations and a decrease
   in both hematocrit (Hct) and muscle moisture content. There is a strong
   relationship between plasma [Na+] at rest and U(crit), where an optimal
   swimming velocity is obtained in animals with resting levels of
   approximately 147 mEq.L-1. Traditionally, the 24-h seawater challenge is
   used to test the hypoosmoregulatory ability in smolting salmonids,
   however, our data suggest that it may also predict the aerobic swimming
   potential of salmonids following seawater transfer. We suggest that the
   reduction in Hct and increase in plasma [Na+] result in reduced oxygen
   delivery to the muscle and that decrease in muscle moisture content
   impairs the contractile process.

AB The heat shock response is a critical mechanism by which organisms
   buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures.
   Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after
   exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefits of Hsp
   expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive
   success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent
   development of unfit phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp
   expression among natural populations of ectotherms may be due to
   interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra
   willow leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis, which lives in highly
   variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the
   Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme
   locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal
   gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of
   a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and
   among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes
   correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for
   reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity.
   Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally
   important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond
   effectively to environmental change.

AB A two-year (2010 and 2011) open field experiment was conducted to study
   the effect of drip irrigation and seasonal variation on the yield
   parameters and main bioactive components, carotenoids (mainly all trans,
   cis lycopene, and beta-carotene), polyphenols (chlorogenic acid, caffeic
   acid, gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, naringin, etc.), and tocopherols of
   processing Strombolino F1 cherry tomatoes. The irrigated plants (STI)
   gave a higher marketable yield (61% and 101% respectively), and rain fed
   plants showed a yield loss. Water supply had a strong positive
   (R-2=0.98) effect on marketable yield in 2011, but weak (R-2=0.69) in
   2010. In both years, the antioxidant concentration (all carotenoids,
   total polyphenols, tocopherols) showed a decrease with irrigation. Water
   supply affected the composition of carotenoids to a considerable extent.
   The optimum water supply treatment gave a lower proportion of lycopene
   than the rain fed control (STC) treatment. We observed significant
   negative correlation between rutin concentration and irrigation. The
   alpha-tocopherol concentration was significantly higher in STC
   treatments. Irrigation negatively influenced antioxidant concentrations
   of cherry tomato fruits, but higher yield could account for the
   concentration loss of individual fruits by higher antioxidant production
   per unit area.

AB Surface water conditions at the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP)
   Site U1314 (Southern Gardar Drift, 56 degrees 21.8' N, 27 degrees 53.3'
   W, 2820 m depth) were inferred using planktic foraminifer assemblages
   between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 19 and 11 (ca. 800-400 ka). Factor
   analysis of the planktic foraminifer assemblages suggests that the
   assemblage was controlled by three factors. The first factor (which
   explained 49% of the variance) is dominated by transitional and subpolar
   species and points to warm and salty surface water conditions (Atlantic
   water). The second factor (37%) is dominated by Neogloboquadrina
   pachyderma sin and has been associated with the presence of cold and low
   saline surface waters (Arctic water). Finally, the third factor (9%),
   linked to a significant presence of Turborotalita quinqueloba, reflects
   the closeness of the Arctic front (the boundary between Atlantic and
   Arctic water). The position of the Arctic and Polar fronts has been
   estimated across the glacial-interglacial cycles studied according to
   planktic foraminifer abundances from Site U1314 (and their factor
   analysis) combined with a synthesis of planktic foraminifer and diatom
   data from other North Atlantic sites. Regarding at the migrations of the
   Arctic front and the surface water masses distribution across each
   climatic cycle we determined five phases of development. Furthermore,
   deep ocean circulation changes observed in glacial-interglacial cycles
   have been associated with each phase. The high abundance of
   transitional-subpolar foraminifers (above 65% at Site 111314) during the
   early interglacial phase indicated that the Arctic front position and
   surface water masses distribution were similar to present conditions.
   During the late interglacial phase. N. pachyderma sin and T. quinqueloba
   slightly increased indicating that winter sea ice slightly expanded
   southwestwards whereas the ice volume remained stable or was still
   decreasing. N. pachyderma sin increased rapidly (above 65% at Site
   U1314) at the first phase of glacial periods indicating the expansion of
   the Arctic waters in the western subpolar North Atlantic. During the
   second phase of glacial periods the transitional-subpolar assemblage
   throve again in the central subpolar North Atlantic associated with
   strong warming events that followed ice-rafting events. The third phase
   of glacial periods corresponds to full glacial conditions in which N.
   pachyderma sin dominated the assemblage for the whole subpolar North
   Atlantic. This division in phases may be applied to the last four
   climatic cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photosynthetic temperature acclimation could strongly affect coupled
   vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks in the global carbon cycle, especially
   as the climate warms. Thermal acclimation of photosynthesis can be
   modelled as changes in the parameters describing the direct effect of
   temperature on photosynthetic capacity (i.e., activation energy, E-a;
   deactivation energy, H-d; entropy parameter, S) or the basal value of
   photosynthetic capacity (i.e., photosynthetic capacity measured at 25
   degrees C). However, the impact of acclimating these parameters
   (individually or in combination) on vegetative carbon gain is relatively
   unexplored. Here we compare the ability of 66 photosynthetic temperature
   acclimation scenarios to improve the ability of a spatially explicit
   canopy carbon flux model, MAESTRA, to predict eddy covariance data from
   a loblolly pine forest. We show that: (1) incorporating seasonal
   temperature acclimation of basal photosynthetic capacity improves the
   model's ability to capture seasonal changes in carbon fluxes and
   outperforms acclimation of other single factors (i.e., E-a or S alone);
   (2) multifactor scenarios of photosynthetic temperature acclimation
   provide minimal (if any) improvement in model performance over single
   factor acclimation scenarios; (3) acclimation of E-a should be
   restricted to the temperature ranges of the data from which the
   equations are derived; and (4) model performance is strongly affected by
   the H-d parameter. We suggest that a renewed effort be made into
   understanding whether basal photosynthetic capacity, E-a, H-d and S
   co-acclimate across broad temperature ranges to determine whether and
   how multifactor thermal acclimation of photosynthesis occurs.

   reproductive characteristics, including clutch size, relative clutch
   mass, egg volume, and hatchling SVL. These differences could be

AB Effective killing of Bacillus anthracis spores is of paramount
   importance to antibioterrorism, food safety, environmental protection,
   and the medical device industry. Thus, a deeper understanding of the
   mechanisms of spore resistance and inactivation is highly desired for
   developing new strategies or improving the known methods for spore
   destruction. Previous studies have shown that spore inactivation
   mechanisms differ considerably depending upon the killing agents, such
   as heat (wet heat, dry heat), UV, ionizing radiation, and chemicals. It
   is believed that wet heat kills spores by inactivating critical enzymes,
   while dry heat kills spores by damaging their DNA. Many studies have
   focused on the biochemical aspects of spore inactivation by dry heat;
   few have investigated structural damages and changes in spore mechanical
   properties. In this study, we have inactivated Bacillus anthracis spores
   with rapid dry heating and performed nanoscale topographical and
   mechanical analysis of inactivated spores using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). Our results revealed significant changes in spore morphology and
   nanomechanical properties after heat inactivation. In addition, we also
   found that these changes were different under different heating
   conditions that produced similar inactivation probabilities (high
   temperature for short exposure time versus low temperature for long
   exposure time). We attributed the differences to the differential
   thermal and mechanical stresses in the spore. The buildup of internal
   thermal and mechanical stresses may become prominent only in ultrafast,
   high-temperature heat inactivation when the experimental timescale is
   too short for heat-generated vapor to efficiently escape from the spore.
   Our results thus provide direct, visual evidences of the importance of
   thermal stresses and heat and mass transfer to spore inactivation by
   very rapid dry heating.

AB Across the globe terrestrial ectothermsamphibians and non-avian
   reptilesare facing a range of emerging challenges. Increasing global
   temperatures, in particular, are affecting all aspects of ectotherm
   biology and life history. Embryonic development is a thermally sensitive
   period of the organismal lifecycle, yet the impacts of thermal stress on
   the early development of ectotherms have significantly lagged behind
   studies of later stages and adult thermal physiology. Morphogenesis, the
   stage where the major anatomical systems are actively forming, is
   particularly sensitive to thermal stress, yet is not studied as often as
   later stages where growth is the primary process happening within the
   egg. Here, we focus on the effects of thermal stress on the first 12
   days of development, the stages of morphogenesis, in the lizard Anolis
   sagrei. We examine the resiliency of the early developmental stages to
   heat stress by incubating eggs at temperatures that parallel conditions
   observed today and predicted over the next 50-100 years of projected
   climate change. Our results suggest that some anole nests are currently
   at the thermal limits for which the early embryonic stages can properly
   develop. Our results emphasize the importance of studying early
   embryonic stages of development and the importance of studying
   stage-specific effects of thermal stress on squamate development.

   limited powers of dispersal. Populations of this species were sampled
   from three California mainland sites, one Channel Island site and one
   site in the upper Gulf of California. A geometric morphometric analysis
   yielded higher resolution in the assessment of phenotypic divergence
   among the four Pacific coast populations than either body measurement or
   meristic analysis, and it showed that most of the shape variation among
   these populations occurs in the head region and body depth of the fish.
   All three analyses supported the hypothesis that populations of A.
   affinis from central and southern California coastal waters and from
   Santa Catalina Island are morphologically distinct from each other; the
   Santa Catalina Island population was found to be the most divergent. On
   the basis of meristic characters alone, the population of A. affinis
   from the upper Gulf of California was different from A. affinis
   populations along the Pacific coast of California. The analyses revealed
   variation in several morphological characters, e.g. body depth and
   meristics, known to vary in association with environmental conditions.
   Given that A. affinis appears to have low among-population genetic
   variation, this species may be phenotypically plastic in response to the
   environmental conditions of the habitat of each population. (C) 2004 The

AB We have used optical tweezers to study the elasticity of red cell
   membranes; force was applied to a bead attached to a permeabilized
   spherical ghost and the force-extension relation was obtained from the
   response of a second bead bound at a diametrically opposite position.
   Interruption of the skeletal network by dissociation of spectrin
   tetramers or extraction of the actin junctions engendered a fourfold
   reduction in stiffness at low applied force, but only a twofold change
   at larger extensions. Proteolytic scission of the ankyrin, which links
   the membrane skeleton to the integral membrane protein, band 3, induced
   a similar effect. The modified, unlike the native membranes, showed
   plastic relaxation under a prolonged stretch. Flaccid giant liposomes
   showed no measurable elasticity. Our observations indicate that the
   elastic character is at least as much a consequence of the attachment of
   spectrin as of a continuous membrane-bound network, and they offer a
   rationale for formation of elliptocytes in genetic conditions associated
   with membrane-skeletal perturbations. The theory of Parker and Winlove
   for elastic deformation of axisymmetric shells (accompanying paper)
   allows us to determine the function Bi-l(2) for the spherical
   saponin-permeabilized ghost membranes (where B is the bending modulus
   and H the shear modulus); taking the literature value of 2 x 10(-19) Nm
   for B, H then emerges as 2 x 10(-6) Nm(-1). This is an order of
   magnitude higher than the value reported for intact cells from
   micropipette aspiration. Reasons for the difference are discussed.

AB Mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) are ideally suited for
   predicting the nonnative distributions of invasive species, but require
   accurate parameterization of key functional traits. Importantly, any
   ability of the invader to acclimate or adapt rapidly to local conditions
   must be incorporated. Our field and laboratory studies measured
   phenotypic variation and tested for plasticity in the thermal
   sensitivity of locomotor performance and low-temperature tolerance of
   adult cane toads Bufo marinus in eastern Australia. We used a
   biophysical model to explore the adaptive significance of this variation
   and how it affected distribution predictions. Laboratory trials showed
   that geographic differences in low-temperature tolerance (i.e., the
   critical thermal minimum; CTMin) of field-caught toads reflect thermal
   acclimation, whereas populations differed in the thermal dependence of
   locomotor performance even after acclimation. Incorporating
   low-temperature tolerance as a dimension of the fundamental niche
   reduced the predicted southern distribution. To test whether these
   factors predicted to be range limiting were consistent with reduced
   performance for individuals, we used the biophysical model and daily
   climate data to conduct "virtual transplants.'' These models predicted
   that acclimation reduced cold stress by 32-100% for toads sheltering
   near the ground surface; toads inside burrows could remain above their
   CTMin, but the required burrow depth increased with latitude.
   Low-temperature tolerance of the adult phase may constrain the southern
   range limit of the cane toad in Australia, and plasticity in this trait
   may have facilitated the southward range expansion.

AB Environmental stress has been suggested to be a major evolutionary
   force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct
   impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability
   of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention
   because of its importance as an ecological feature and the relative ease
   with which it can be experimentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution
   Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where
   ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary
   differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale
   lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we
   investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different
   components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing.
   Combining geometric and traditional morphometrics, we find only limited
   evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating
   simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale
   lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could
   not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered
   on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of
   the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing
   mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently
   affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific
   relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry.
   Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns
   of wing shape variation are not identical, supporting the view that the
   underlying developmental processes are to a certain extent different.

AB The surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus is abundant and widely distributed
   on reefs throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Population samples at
   15 sites that spanned 158 degrees of longitude and 40 degrees of
   latitude across both hemispheres of the Indian and Pacific oceans
   allowed us to examine geographic variation in longevity, growth rate and
   adult size of this species. Samples from 5 sites in the Indian Ocean, 6
   in the western Pacific and 4 in the central Pacific provided
   otolith-based estimates of size-at-age for 1537 individuals. All
   populations displayed rapid growth to a distinct asymptotic size, a
   pattern characteristic of many acanthuroid fishes. In both oceans, fish
   lived longer at higher latitudes; in addition, Indian Ocean populations
   tended to be shorter-lived than those in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast,
   growth rate and adult size did not differ between the 2 oceans, and were
   not related to temperature (as a proxy for latitude) in either the
   Pacific or the Indian Ocean. Further, we found no relationship between
   fishing pressure and longevity, growth or adult size across our set of
   sampling sites, among which fishing pressure on this species varied from
   intense to zero. We hypothesize that (1) growth and adult size are most
   responsive to local environmental features unrelated to latitudinal
   (temperature) effects; and (2) variation in longevity reflects a
   combination of responses to latitudinal (temperature) gradients and as
   yet unidentified environmental differences between the Indian and
   Pacific oceans.

AB This paper presents the results from a palaeoecological study to
   establish the impact of prehistoric human activity and climate change on
   the vegetation and soils of the Goualougo area of the Nouabale- Ndoki
   National Park, in the Republic of Congo ( Congo - Brazzaville). This is
   a region that is known from previous work ( through evidence of pottery,
   furnaces and charcoal layers beneath the present day rainforest
   vegetation) to have had prehistoric settlement dating back to at least
   2000 calibrated years before present. In addition, there is climatic
   evidence to suggest that significant variations in precipitation have
   occurred in central Africa over the last few millennia. Presently, the
   region is covered in uninhabited moist semi-evergreen rainforest. Key
   research questions addressed in this paper include the extent to which
   the present-day composition of rainforest in this region is as a result
   of processes of the past ( climate change and/or human activity), and
   the resilience of the rainforest to these perturbations.
   Statistical analyses of pollen, microscopic charcoal and geochemical
   data are used to determine the relationship over time between vegetation
   dynamics and climate change, anthropogenic burning and metal smelting.
   Significant changes in forest composition are linked to burning and
   climate change but not metallurgy. The strongest influence on the
   present day composition appears to be related to the increased
   anthropogenic burning that started approximately 1000 years ago. Results
   from this study are discussed in terms of their implications for the
   present and future management of this globally important forested
   region.

AB Latitudinal variation of the polymorphic sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
   (alpha-Gpdh) locus in Drosophila melanogaster has been characterized on
   several continents; however, apparent clinal patterns are potentially
   confounded by linkage with an inversion, close associations with other
   genetic markers that vary clinally, and a tandern alpha-Gpdh pseudogene.
   Here we compare clinal patterns in alpha-Gpdh with those of other linked
   markers by testing field flies from eastern Australian locations
   collected in two separate years. The a-Gpdh variation exhibited a
   consistent non-linear cline reflecting an increase in the alpha-Gpdh(F)
   allele at extreme latitudes. This pattern was not influenced by the
   In(2L)t inversion wherein this locus is located, nor was it influenced
   by the presence of the alpha-Gpdh pseudogene, whose presence was
   ubiquitous and highly variable among Populations. The alpha-Gpdh pattern
   was also independent of a cline in allozyme frequencies at the alcohol
   dehydrogenase (Adh) locus, and two length polymorphisms in the Adh gene.
   These results suggest clinal selection at the alpha-Gpdh locus that is
   partially or wholly unrelated to linear climatic gradients along the
   eastern coast of Australia.

AB The seasonal marine feeding pattern of sea trout was studied from March
   to December 2001 in two large fjords situated at latitudes 69 degrees N
   and 66 degrees N in the northern part of Norway. Despite low sea
   temperatures and high salinity, sea running trout were caught during all
   sampling occasions in both fjords. The trout had fed extensively oil
   marine crustaceans (shrimps, amphipods, and krill) and polychaetes
   during early and late winter, and had a stable or increasing condition
   factor during this period. In summer and autumn, the trout fed
   predominantly on fish, mainly juvenile herring. Food consumption rates
   were lowest during late autumn and early winter (October-December) in
   both fjords, while trout in the southernmost fjord had the highest
   consumption rates from April to August and trout in the northernmost
   fjord from May to September. These patterns in both fjords matched the
   seasonal variations in condition factor and relative lipid content of
   the fish during the same periods. The marine winter migration of these
   northern sea trout populations appears to be a feeding migration in
   which the fish maintain or increase their body condition, representing a
   previously undocumented alternative to the more common life history
   strategy of over-wintering and starvation in freshwater at the northern
   distribution of this species. (c) 2005 International Council for the

AB In chloroplast, proton motive force (pmf) is critical for ATP synthesis
   and photoprotection. To prevent photoinhibition of photosynthetic
   apparatus, proton gradient (pH) across the thylakoid membranes needs to
   be built up to minimize the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   in thylakoid membranes. However, the regulation of thylakoid pmf in
   immature leaves is little known. In this study, we compared
   photosynthetic electron sinks, P700 redox state, non-photochemical
   quenching (NPQ), and electrochromic shift (ECS) signal in immature and
   mature leaves of a cultivar of Camellia. The immature leaves displayed
   lower linear electron flow and cyclic electron flow, but higher levels
   of NPQ and P700 oxidation ratio under high light. Meanwhile, we found
   that pmf and pH were higher in the immature leaves. Furthermore, the
   immature leaves showed significantly lower thylakoid proton conductivity
   than mature leaves. These results strongly indicated that immature
   leaves can build up enough pH by modulating proton efflux from the
   lumenal side to the stromal side of thylakoid membranes, which is
   essential to prevent photoinhibition via thermal energy dissipation and
   photosynthetic control of electron transfer. This study highlights that
   the activity of chloroplast ATP synthase is a key safety valve for
   photoprotection in immature leaves.

   were obtained: (a) there was a light-dark difference in MAP during
   non-REM (NREM) sleep and Tb during both NREM and REM sleep; (b) the
   increase of MAP in going from NREM to REM sleep in the light period was
   greater than that in the dark period, whereas the increase of Tb in the
   light period was not different from that in the dark period; (c) the
   maximum and CV% for MAP during REM sleep in the light period were
   greater than those in the dark period; (d) there was a negative
   correlation between the average Tb and MAP CV% during REM sleep. We
   suggest that phasic fluctuation of MAP during REM sleep may be
   influenced, in part, by a factor independent of sleep mechanisms.

   equations for v(c) and v(o) in response to changing CO(2) and O(2)
   concentrations were simultaneously solved for the CO(2) (K(c)) and O(2)
   (K(o)) constants, the maximum turnover rates of the enzyme for CO(2)
   (kcat(CO2)) and O(2) (kcat(O2)) and the specificity for CO(2) relative
   to O(2) (S(c/o)). In the C(4) species Zea mays K(c) was higher but K(o)
   was lower compared with the C(3) species Triticum aestivum. The
   kcat(CO2) was higher and the kcat(O2) lower in Z. mays compared with T.
   aestivum and S(c/o) was similar in the two species. The V(omax)/V(cmax)
   was lower in Z. mays and thus did not correlate with changes in S(c/o).
   In conclusion, this mass spectrometer system provides a means of
   simultaneously determining the important Rubisco kinetic parameters,
   K(c), K(o), kcat(CO2,)kcat(O2) and S(c/o) from the same set of assays.

AB Ocean warming can drive poleward shifts of commercially important
   species with potentially significant economic impacts. Nowhere are those
   impacts greater than in the Gulf of Maine where North America's most
   valuable marine species, the American lobster (Homarus americanus Milne
   Edwards), has thrived for decades. However, there are growing concerns
   that regional maritime economies will suffer as monitored shallow water
   young-of-year lobsters decline and landings shift to the northeast. We
   examine how the interplay of ocean warming, tidal mixing, and larval
   behavior results in a brighter side of climate change. Since the 1980s
   lobster stocks have increased fivefold. We suggest that this increase
   resulted from a complex interplay between lobster larvae settlement
   behavior, climate change, and local oceanographic conditions.
   Specifically, postlarval sounding behavior is confined to a thermal
   envelope above 12 degrees C and below 20 degrees C. Summer thermally
   stratified surface waters in southwestern regions have historically been
   well within the settlement thermal envelope. Although surface layers are
   warming fastest in this region, the steep depth-wise temperature
   gradient caused thermally suitable areas for larval settlement to expand
   only modestly. This contrasts with the northeast where strong tidal
   mixing prevents thermal stratification and recent ocean warming has made
   an expansive area of seabed more favorable for larval settlement. Recent
   declines in lobster settlement densities observed at shallow monitoring
   sites correlate with the expanded area of thermally suitable habitat
   associated with warmer summers. This leads us to hypothesize that the
   expanded area of suitable habitat may help explain strong lobster
   population increases in this region over the last decade and offset
   potential future declines. It also suggests that the fate of fisheries
   in a changing climate requires understanding local interaction between
   life stage-specific biological thresholds and finer scale oceanographic
   processes.

AB For species' dynamics highly influenced by environmental conditions,
   sustainable management for conservation and/or exploitation purposes
   requires the ability to segregate natural processes from anthropogenic
   impacts. In this context, identification of phenotypic variations in
   morphological patterns, and clarification of the mechanisms involved,
   constitute useful tools to identify adequate management measures from
   Europe-wide to local conditions. Although such approaches are already
   used effectively in the management of fish stocks, they are more recent
   for bivalve stocks, which are also good candidates for such management
   tools. The current study examines morphological patterns in the Manila
   clam (Venerupis philippinarum) through morphometric studies of 4
   populations on the French Atlantic coast (Banc du Guer, Morbihan Gulf,
   Bellevue, and Arcachon Bay). The methodology relies mainly on
   conventional shape analysis using 8 morphometric ratios involving
   metrics and weight. In addition, an outline description was created for
   selected individuals that revealed different forms of the
   anterior-dorsal valve margin identified for future research. Using
   supervised classification methods, morphometric-latitudinal trends were
   revealed between northern and southern populations of V. philippinarum.
   Relationships between discriminatory morphometric ratios (describing
   elongation, valve density, and weight related to length) and available
   environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a
   concentrations) were considered using linear multilevel models. They
   revealed significant relationships with chlorophyll a concentrations and
   with 1 ratio with seawater temperature ranging from 12-20 degrees C.
   Four potential causes were hypothesized to explain the unexpected
   relationship identified between morphometric characteristics and trophic
   conditions: (1) a negative effect resulting from high chlorophyll a
   concentrations, (2) a masked effect of other food resources affecting
   valve growth, (3) interspecific competition for food among
   filter-feeding populations, (4) and effects of other environmental
   parameters such as sediment type. Observed differences in shape may
   result from a combination of these 4 causes with varying degrees,
   depending on site-specific environmental conditions. Last, the
   consequences of morphometric variation on population regulation are
   addressed.

AB Latitudinal clinal variation in wing size and shape has evolved in North
   American populations of Drosophila subobscura within about 20 years
   since colonization. While the size cline is consistent to that found in
   original European populations (and globally in other Drosophila
   species), different parts of the wing have evolved on the two
   continents. This clearly suggests that 'chance and necessity' are
   simultaneously playing their roles in the process of adaptation. We
   report here rapid and consistent thermal evolution of wing shape (but
   not size) that apparently is at odds with that suggestion. Three
   replicated populations of D. subobscura derived from an outbred stock at
   Puerto Montt (Chile) were kept at each of three temperatures (13, 18 and
   22 degreesC) for 1 year and have diverged for 27 generations at most. We
   used the methods of geometric morphometrics to study wing shape
   variation in both females and males from the thermal stocks, and rates
   of genetic divergence for wing shape were found to be as fast or even
   faster than those previously estimated for wing size on a continental
   scale. These shape changes did not follow a neat linear trend with
   temperature, and are associated with localized shifts of particular
   landmarks with some differences between sexes. Wing shape variables were
   found to differ in response to male genetic constitution for polymorphic
   chromosomal inversions, which strongly suggests that changes in gene
   arrangement frequencies as a response to temperature underlie the
   correlated changes in wing shape because of gene-inversion linkage
   disequilibria. In fact, we also suggest that the shape cline in North
   America likely predated the size cline and is consistent with the quite
   different evolutionary rates between inversion and size clines. These
   findings cast strong doubts on the supposed 'unpredictability' of the
   geographical cline for wing traits in D. subobscura North American
   colonizing populations.

AB We investigated geographic variation in size and stage (instar) at
   maturity of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) on the eastern Bering Sea
   shelf. Size-frequency distribution analysis showed that females can
   reach maturity at four different instars, presumably Instars VIII to XI.
   Geographic variation in instar structure generates clinal variation in
   size at maturity, front small size at high latitudes (colder) to large
   size at low latitudes (warmer). Different pieces of evidence support the
   hypothesis that geographic variation in mature female size is a
   phenotypic response to environmental conditions governed by a single
   reaction norm. Clinal variation conforms to the "inverse Bergmann's
   rule". We argue that a single macroecological rule should not be
   expected to explain all latitudinal size gradients observed in marine
   invertebrates. Size at maturity fluctuated cyclically. and was
   negatively and significantly cross-correlated with strength in the
   recruitment of females to the mature Population. Cycles in the latter
   were manifested as four commensurate and regularly spaced pulses over
   the last three decades. Mechanisms that may underlay this intriguing
   phenomenon, including density-dependent growth rate, require further
   scrutiny.

AB Incubation behavior is one component of reproductive effort and thus
   influences the evolution of life-history strategies. We examined the
   relative importance of body mass, frequency of mate feeding, food, nest
   predation, and ambient temperature to explain interspecific variation in
   incubation behavior (nest attentiveness, on- and off-bout durations, and
   nest trips per hour) using comparative analyses for North American
   passerines in which only females incubate. Body mass and frequency of
   mate feeding explained little variation in incubation behavior. We were
   also unable to detect any influence of food; diet and foraging strategy
   explained little interspecific variation in incubation behavior.
   However, the typical temperature encountered during reproduction
   explained significant variation in incubation behavior: Species breeding
   in colder environments take shorter bouts off the nest, which prevents
   eggs from cooling to temperatures below the physiological zero
   temperature. These species must compensate for shorter off-bouts by
   taking more of them (thus shorter on-bouts) to obtain needed energy for
   incubation. Nest predation also explains significant variation in
   incubation behavior among passerines: Species that endure high nest
   predation have evolved an incubation strategy (long on- and off-bouts)
   that minimizes activity that could attract predators. Nest substrate
   explained additional Variation in incubation behavior (cavity-nesting
   birds have shorter on-bouts and make more frequent nest trips),
   presumably because nest predation and/or temperature varies among nest
   substrates. Thus, nest predation can influence reproductive effort in a
   way previously not demonstrated-by placing a constraint on parental
   activity at the nest. Incubating birds face an ecological cost
   associated with reproductive effort (predation of entire brood) that
   should be considered in future attempts to explain avian life-history
   evolution.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.) is a chill-susceptible crop cultivated in northern
   latitude environments. The detrimental effects of cold on growth and
   photosynthetic activity have long been established. However, a general
   overview of how important these processes are with respect to the
   reduction of productivity reported in the field is still lacking. In
   this study, a model-assisted approach was used to dissect variations in
   productivity under suboptimal temperatures and quantify the relative
   contributions of light interception (PAR(c)) and radiation use
   efficiency (RUE) from emergence to flowering. A combination of
   architectural and light transfer models was used to calculate light
   interception in three field experiments with two cold-tolerant lines and
   at two sowing dates. Model assessment confirmed that the approach was
   suitable to infer light interception. Biomass production was strongly
   affected by early sowings. RUE was identified as the main cause of
   biomass reduction during cold events. Furthermore, PAR(c) explained most
   of the variability observed at flowering, its relative contributions
   being more or less important according to the climate experienced. Cold
   temperatures resulted in lower PAR(c), mainly because final leaf length
   and width were significantly reduced for all leaves emerging after the
   first cold occurrence. These results confirm that virtual plants can be
   useful as fine phenotyping tools. A scheme of action of cold on leaf
   expansion, light interception and radiation use efficiency is discussed
   with a view towards helping breeders define relevant selection criteria.

AB Boreal forests emit a large amount of monoterpenes into the atmosphere.
   Traditionally these emissions are assumed to originate as evaporation
   from large storage pools. Thus, their diurnal cycle would depend mostly
   on temperature. However, there is indication that a significant part of
   the monoterpene emission would originate directly from de novo
   synthesis. By applying 13CO(2) fumigation and analyzing the isotope
   fractions with proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and
   classical GC-MS, we determined the fractions of monoterpene emissions
   originating from de novo biosynthesis in Pinus sylvestris (58%), Picea
   abies (33.5%), Larix decidua (9.8%) and Betula pendula (100%).
   Application of the observed split between de novo and pool emissions
   from P. sylvestris in a hybrid emission algorithm resulted in a better
   description of ecosystem scale monoterpene emissions from a boreal Scots
   pine forest stand.

AB Microbial phytases are enzymes with biotechnological interest for the

   the stability and activity of extracellular phytase produced by R.
   microsporus var. micros porus biofilm is described. The phytase was
   spray-dried in the presence of starch, corn meal (>150 mu m), soy bean
   meal (SB), corn meal (<150 mu m) (CM), and maltodextrin as drying
   adjuvants. The residual enzyme activity after drying ranged from 10.7%
   to 60.4%, with SB and CM standing out as stabilizing agents. Water
   concentration and residual enzyme activity were determined in obtained
   powders as a function of the drying condition. When exposed to different
   pH values, the SB and CM products were stable, with residual activity
   above 50% in the pH range from 4.5 to 8.5 for 60 min. The use of CM as
   drying adjuvant promoted the best retention of enzymatic activity
   compared with SB. Spray drying of the R. micros porus var. micros porus
   phytase using different drying adjuvants showed interesting results,
   being quite feasible with regards their biotechnological applications,
   especially for poultry diets.

AB Many organisms show latitudinal variation for various genetically
   determined traits. Such dines may involve neutral variation and
   originate from historical events or their maintenance may be explained
   by selection. For Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation for
   allozymes, inversions, and quantitative traits has been found on several
   continents. We sampled D. melanogaster populations in Panama and along a
   transect of 40 latitudinal degrees on the west coast of South America.
   Negative correlations with latitude were found for Adh(S) and alpha
   Gpdh(F) allele frequencies and for the frequency of the cosmopolitan
   inversion In(2L)t in Adh(S) alpha Gpdh(F) chromosomes. A positive
   correlation existed between wing length and latitude. Significant
   correlations were found between these traits and climatic variables like
   temperature and rainfall. The observed dines show considerable
   resemblance to those found on other continents. Gametic disequilibrium
   between Adh(S) and alpha Gpdh(F) occurred predominantly at higher
   latitudes and was caused by the presence of In(2L)t. The reasons for the
   clinaI. distributions are discussed and it is argued that selection is
   the most likely explanation. However, the exact nature of the selective
   force and the interactions of allozymes with each other and with In(2L)t
   are complex and not fully understood. In tropical regions
   In(2L)t-containing genotypes have higher fitness than ST/ST and Adh and
   alpha Gpdh hitchhike with the inversion, but there is also evidence for
   balancing selection at the Adh locus.

AB Statoliths of the gonatid squid Gonatus fabricii from Disko Bay, West

   mass-spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to determine the concentrations and
   spatial distributions of 9 minor and trace elements (Sr, Ba, Mg, U, Zn,
   Mn, Y, Zr, Na). Element composition was assigned in situ to distinct
   statolith regions, corresponding to ontogenetic stages of an individual
   squid's life. Significant variations in concentrations of all measured
   elements except Na were found between different regions of the
   statolith. Variations in Ba/Ca ratios suggest that juveniles inhabit
   surface waters, while larger specimens move to deeper waters. U/Ca and
   Sr/Ca ratios increased towards the outer statolith region, suggesting
   migration of adult squid into colder waters. Mg/Ca ratios decreased
   progressively from the core to the edge, most likely related to changes
   in protein concentrations in their microstructure during ontogenesis.
   This study is one of the first to apply LA-ICP-MS to cephalopod
   statoliths. Our results emphasise the strong potential of spatially
   resolved statolith analyses to gather information on life history,
   migrations and habitat use of cephalopods.

   the immunological and the molecular biological methods to understand the
   significance of Hsp (hypoxia) adaptation in the organic high elevation,
   through the mammal heat shock response. (1) From high elevation to low
   elevation (natural hypoxia): Western blot and conventional RT-PCR and
   real-time fluorescence quota PCR were adopted. Expression difference of
   heat shock protein of 70 (Hsp70) and natural expression of brain tissue
   of Hsp70 gene was determined in the cardiac muscle tissue among the
   different elevation mammals (yak). (2)From low elevation to high
   elevation (hypoxia induction): The mammals (domestic rabbits) from the
   low elevation were sent directly to the areas with different high
   elevations like 2300,3300 and 5000 m above sea level to be raised for a
   period of 3 weeks before being slaughtered and the genetic inductive
   expression of the brain tissue of Hsp70 was determined with RT-PCR. The
   result indicated that all of the mammals at different elevations
   possessed their heat shock response gene. Hsp70 of the high elevation
   mammal rose abruptly under stress and might be induced to come into
   being by high elevation (hypoxia). The speedy synthesis of Hsp70 in the
   process of heat shock response is suitable to maintain the cells' normal
   physiological functions under stress. The Hsp70 has its threshold value.
   The altitude of 5000 m above sea level is the best condition for the
   heat shock response, and it starts to reduce when the altitude is over
   6000 m above sea level. The Hsp70 production quantity and the cell
   hypoxia bearing capacity have their direct ratio.

   individual-based evolutionary models to assess the relative advantages
   of 15 different learning strategies (genetic determination, individual
   learning, vertical social learning, horizontal/oblique social learning,
   and contingent combinations of these) when competing in variable
   environments described by I/f noise. When environmental variation has
   little effect on fitness, then genetic determinism persists. When
   environmental variation is large and equal over all time-scales ("white
   noise") then individual learning is adaptive. Social learning is
   advantageous in "red noise" environments when variation over long
   time-scales is large. Climatic variability increases with time-scale, so
   that short-lived organisms should be able to rely largely on genetic
   determination. Thermal climates usually are insufficiently red for
   social learning to be advantageous for species whose fitness is very
   determined by temperature. In contrast, population trajectories of many
   species, especially large mammals and aquatic carnivores, are
   sufficiently red to promote social learning in their predators. The
   ocean environment is generally redder than that on land. Thus, while
   individual learning should be adaptive for many longer-lived organisms,
   social learning will often be found in those dependent on the
   populations of other species, especially if they are marine. This
   provides a potential explanation for the evolution of a prevalence of
   social learning, and culture, in humans and cetaceans. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Epidemics of dengue fever in China were reported before 1940 and the
   outbreak of dengue fever in Guangdong province in 2014 is the most
   serious so far. The important question is what factors account for this
   serious outbreak, and how to evaluate the sensitivity of the multiple
   factors including weather variables and human actions on the dengue
   disease. Therefore, according to the relations among the temperature
   (daily mean temperature (DMT) and diurnal temperature range (DTR)),
   vector parameters and reproduction number we have proposed the
   analytical formula for the relative vector's capacity and effective
   reproduction number, and then we have the formula for the likelihood
   function by employing the generation interval-informed method. This
   allows us to estimate the unknown vector parameters by the maximum
   likelihood method and carry out the sensitivity analysis. The
   correlations between the density of mosquito vectors (the Breteau index
   (BI), the adult mosquito density) and the daily newly reported cases of
   four different districts of Guangzhou city have been studied by using
   the Pearson correlation and cross-correlation analyses. Our findings
   indicate that both the BI and the adult mosquito density are
   statistically significantly correlated with the daily newly reported
   cases, and the vector parameters are closely related to the DMT and DTR
   with relative complex relationships, which influence the effective
   reproduction number comprehensively. Moreover, the trend of the
   effective reproduction number is consistent with daily newly reported
   cases, which confirms the effectiveness of the government control
   measures. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the temperature can
   be either an effective barrier or a facilitator of vector-borne
   diseases, and consequently weather variable may result in complexity of
   dengue disease control.

   amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it
   would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic
   organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of
   temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted
   water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments
   were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD
   (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to
   daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)),
   and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the "vertical
   shift or faster-slower" hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming
   performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under
   more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second,
   there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by
   means of significant repeatability estimates.
   Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant
   acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal
   performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual
   organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation
   acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of
   physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary
   responses to global change.

AB We report numerical simulation results for the force-velocity relation
   for actin-polymerization-driven motility. We use Brownian dynamics to
   solve a physically consistent formulation of the dendritic nucleation
   model with semiflexible filaments that self-assemble and push a disk. We
   find that at small loads, the disk speed is independent of load, whereas
   at high loads, the speed decreases and vanishes at a characteristic
   stall pressure. Our results demonstrate that at small loads, the
   velocity is controlled by the reaction rates, whereas at high loads the
   stall pressure is determined by the mechanical properties of the
   branched actin network. The behavior is consistent with experiments and
   with our recently proposed self-diffusiophoretic mechanism for
   actin-polymerization-driven motility. New in vitro experiments to
   measure the force-velocity relation are proposed.

AB Elevational gradients provide powerful natural systems for testing
   hypotheses regarding the role of environmental variation in the
   evolution of life-history strategies. Case studies have revealed shifts
   towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet
   no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history
   traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history
   traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species
   worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational
   shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that
   fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and
   fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational
   differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival
   varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later
   breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that
   temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch
   size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population
   comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained
   species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational
   gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits
   were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic
   (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population
   structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or
   processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature
   of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set.
   We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing
   climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to
   recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species
   experienced higher survival at higher elevations.

AB There is much interest in cultivating C-4 perennial plants in northern
   climates where there is an abundance of land and a potential large
   market for biofuels. C-4 feedstocks can exhibit superior yields to C-3
   alternatives during the long warm days of summer at high latitude, but
   their summer success depends on an ability to tolerate deep winter cold,
   spring frosts, and early growth-season chill. Here, we review cold
   tolerance limits in C-4 perennial grasses. Dozens of C-4 species are
   known from high latitudes to 63 degrees N and elevations up to 5200 m,
   demonstrating that C-4 plants can adapt to cold climates. Of the three
   leading C-4 grasses being considered for bioenergy production in cold
   climates-Miscanthus spp., switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and prairie
   cordgrass (Spartina pectinata)-all are tolerant of cool temperatures
   (10-15 degrees C), but only cordgrass tolerates hard spring frosts. All
   three species overwinter as dormant rhizomes. In the productive
   Miscanthusxgiganteus hybrids, exposure to temperatures below -3 degrees
   C to -7 degrees C will kill overwintering rhizomes, while for upland
   switchgrass and cordgrass, rhizomes survive exposure to temperatures
   above -20 degrees C to -24 degrees C. Cordgrass emerges earlier than
   switchgrass and M. giganteus genotypes, but lacks the Miscanthus growth
   potential once warmer days of late spring arrive. To enable C-4-based
   bioenergy production in colder climates, breeding priorities should
   emphasize improved cold tolerance of M. xgiganteus, and enhanced
   productivity of switchgrass and cordgrass. This should be feasible in
   the near future, because wild populations of each species exhibit a
   diverse range of cold tolerance and growth capabilities.

AB The 1991-93 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event first appeared in
   the northern Gulf of Alaska in autumn 1991 with warm sea-surface
   temperatures. In winter 1992, there were pulses of increased sea level
   and anomalous circulation. El Nino conditions persisted at least through
   summer 1993. The effects of this ENSO event on major groundfish species
   and Pacific herring in the northern Gulf of Alaska were examined and
   compared with the effects of previous ENSO events. There is little
   evidence that the 1991-93 or 1982-83 ENSO events affected landings of
   walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, or arrowtooth flounder.
   Some changes in distribution of groundfish species were observed in
   1993, but the effect was similar to changes observed in non-ENSO warm
   years. In general, warm ocean conditions have a positive effect on
   recruitment of northern stocks, but ENSO events appear to have an
   inconsistent effect on year-class strength within species and among
   different species. For example, strong year classes of halibut and
   arrowtooth flounder sometimes, but not always, coincide with ENSO
   events; ENSO events are associated with moderate to weak year classes of
   cod and pollock. However, post-ENSO warm years often are associated with
   strong recruitment of many groundfish species. Major changes have
   occurred in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem since 1977. The influence of
   the 1976 ENSO event in precipitating these changes and the role of the
   frequency or strength of subsequent El Nino events is presently unknown.
   Herring and other stocks of small pelagic fishes may be more affected by
   ENSO events. In particular, decreased catches, recruitment, and
   weight-at-age of herring are sometimes associated with ENSO events.
   Furthermore, a variety of seabirds which feed mostly on pelagic forage
   fishes or the pelagic juvenile stages of groundfish suffered widespread
   mortalities and breeding failures in the Gulf of Alaska during the ENSO
   years of 1983 and 1993. These effects on seabirds were also observed
   over a wider geographic range, from California to the western Bering
   Sea.

AB Aim Climate variability is an important mediating agent of ecosystem
   dynamics in cold, semi-arid regions such as the mountains of western
   North America. Climatically sensitive tree-ring chronologies offer a
   means of assessing the impact of climate variability on tree growth
   across temporal scales of years to centuries and spatial scales of
   metres to subcontinents. Our goal was to bring practices from landscape
   ecology that highlight the impact of landscape heterogeneity on
   ecological pattern and processes into a dendroclimatic study that shows
   that the biophysical setting of target trees affects ring-width
   patterns.
   Location This study was conducted at two sites near alpine treeline in
   the Sequoia National Park, USA (36degrees30' 00' N, 118degrees30' 00'
   W).
   Methods We collected stand information and increment cores from foxtail
   pines (Pinus balfouriana Grev. et Balf.) for eight tree-ring
   chronologies in four extreme biophysical settings at two sites using
   proxies for soil moisture and radiation derived from a digital elevation
   model.
   Results Biophysical setting affected forest age-class structure, with
   wet and bright plots showing high recruitment after 1900 AD, but had no
   obvious effect on immature stem density (e.g. seedlings). Biophysical
   setting strongly affected ring-width patterns, with wet plots having
   higher correlation with instrumental temperature records while dry plots
   correlated better with instrumental precipitation records. Ring-width
   chronologies from the wet plots showed strong low-frequency variability
   (i.e. hundreds of years) while ring-width chronologies from the dry
   plots showed strong variability on multidecadal scales.
   Main conclusions There was a strong association between biophysical
   setting and age-class structure, and with ring-width patterns in foxtail
   pine. The mediation of ring widths by biophysical setting has the
   potential to further the understanding of the expression of
   synoptic-scale climate across rugged terrain. When combined with
   remotely sensed imagery, a priori GIS modelling of tree growth offers a
   viable means to devise first-order predictions of climatic impacts in
   subalpine forest dynamics and to develop flexible and powerful
   monitoring schemes.

AB Two different cDNA sequences, designated OepFAD2-1 and OepFAD2-2,
   encoding two microsomal oleate desaturases (FAD2) have been isolated
   from olive (Olea europaea cv. Picual) using a PCR approach. Both deduced
   amino acid sequences showed the three histidine boxes characteristic of
   all membrane-bound desaturases, and possess a C-terminal endoplasmic
   reticulum retention signal. Phylogenetic analysis shows that OepFAD2-1
   and OepFAD2-2 are grouped with other plant FAD2 sequences. Functional
   expression of the corresponding FAD2 cDNAs in yeast confirmed that they
   encode microsomal oleate desaturases. Genomic Southern blot analysis is
   consistent with the presence of at least two copies of each OepFAD2 gene
   in the olive genome. OepFAD2-1 transcript was strongly detected in very
   young seeds and in leaves, showing low levels in mesocarps, while the
   transcript of the OepFAD2-2 gene was moderately expressed in developing
   seeds, ripening mesocarp and leaves. These expression data suggest
   differential functions for the two olive microsomal oleate desaturase
   genes, with FAD2-1 possibly responsible for the desaturation of reserve
   lipids in the young seed, while FAD2-2 may be mainly involved in storage
   lipid desaturation in the mature seeds and the mesocarp. (c) 2005

AB Spatial heterogeneity is a fundamental property of any natural
   ecosystems, including hot spring and human microbiomes. Two important
   scales that spatial heterogeneity exhibits are population and community
   scales, and Taylor's power law (PL) and its extensions (PLEs) offer
   ideal quantitative models to assess population- and community-level
   heterogeneities. Here we analyse 165 hot spring microbiome samples at
   the global scale that cover a wide range of temperatures (7.5-99 degrees
   C) and pH levels (3.3-9). We explore a question of fundamental
   importance for measuring the spatial heterogeneity of the hot-spring
   microbiome and further discuss their ecological implications: How do
   critical environmental factors such as temperature and pH influence the
   scaling of community spatial heterogeneity? We are particularly
   interested in the existence of a universal scaling model that is
   independent of environmental gradients. By applying PL and PLEs, we were
   able to obtain such scaling parameters of the hot spring at both
   community and population levels, which are temperature- and
   pH-invariant. These findings suggest that while the hot-spring
   microbiomes located at different regions may have different
   environmental conditions, they share a fundamental heterogeneity scaling
   parameter, analogically similar to the gravitational acceleration on
   Earth, which may vary slightly depending on altitude and latitude, but
   is invariant overall. In contrast, similar to the physics of the Moon
   and Earth, which have different gravitational accelerations, the hot
   spring and human microbiomes can have different scaling parameters as
   demonstrated in this study.

AB In organic-rich shallow habitats, benthic macrofauna is known to play a
   major role in the geochemical functioning of surficial sediments through
   its metabolism, as well as its bioirrigation and/or bioturbation
   activity. In this paper, the effects of benthic macrofauna on metabolic
   fluxes at the sediment-water interface were studied at four dates, from
   winter to late summer, on two major macrobenthic communities of the
   eastern English Channel (macrotidal system): the fine sand Abra alba
   community (2 stations) and the sandy gravel Ophiothrix fragilis
   community (1 station). Oxygen and ammonium fluxes showed temporal
   changes that could be attributed to the variation of sea water
   temperature. Once the effect of temperature removed (using Q(10) = 2.5),
   the average fauna mediated fluxes (F-Fauna) represented respectively 77%
   and 76% of average total fluxes. Considering the whole dataset, species
   number and biomass showed a significant correlation with fauna mediated
   fluxes of O-2 and NH4+, while the relationships with abundance were not
   significant. The species composition of the community might influence
   ecosystem functioning, but in the present study, functional groups have
   a very poor relationship with F-Fauna (O-2) and F-Fauna (NH4+). Despite
   the presence of engineer species, establishing general and simple rules
   to link macrofaunal parameters to functional attributes remains very
   difficult, suggesting that communities rather followed the idiosyncrasy
   and rivet hypothesis.

AB A common, long-held belief is that metabolic rate drives the rates of
   various biological, ecological and evolutionary processes. Although this
   metabolic pacemaker view (as assumed by the recent, influential
   'metabolic theory of ecology') may be true in at least some situations
   (e.g. those involving moderate temperature effects or physiological
   processes closely linked to metabolism, such as heartbeat and breathing
   rate), it suffers from several major limitations, including: (i) it is
   supported chiefly by indirect, correlational evidence (e.g. similarities
   between the body-size and temperature scaling of metabolic rate and that
   of other biological processes, which are not always observed) - direct,
   mechanistic or experimental support is scarce and much needed; (ii) it
   is contradicted by abundant evidence showing that various intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors (e.g. hormonal action and temperature changes) can
   dissociate the rates of metabolism, growth, development and other
   biological processes; (iii) there are many examples where metabolic rate
   appears to respond to, rather than drive the rates of various other
   biological processes (e.g. ontogenetic growth, food intake and locomotor
   activity); (iv) there are additional examples where metabolic rate
   appears to be unrelated to the rate of a biological process (e.g.
   ageing, circadian rhythms, and molecular evolution); and (v) the
   theoretical foundation for the metabolic pacemaker view focuses only on
   the energetic control of biological processes, while ignoring the
   importance of informational control, as mediated by various genetic,
   cellular, and neuroendocrine regulatory systems. I argue that a
   comprehensive understanding of the pace of life must include how
   biological activities depend on both energy and information and their
   environmentally sensitive interaction. This conclusion is supported by
   extensive evidence showing that hormones and other regulatory factors
   and signalling systems coordinate the processes of growth, metabolism
   and food intake in adaptive ways that are responsive to an organism's
   internal and external conditions. Metabolic rate does not merely dictate
   growth rate, but is coadjusted with it. Energy and information use are
   intimately intertwined in living systems: biological signalling pathways
   both control and respond to the energetic state of an organism. This
   review also reveals that we have much to learn about the temporal
   structure of the pace of life. Are its component processes highly
   integrated and synchronized, or are they loosely connected and often
   discordant? And what causes the level of coordination that we see? These
   questions are of great theoretical and practical importance.

AB In eastern North America, body size of the larval ant lion Myrmeleon
   immaculatus increases from south to north, following Bergmann's rule. We
   used a common-garden experiment and a reciprocal-transplant experiment
   to evaluate the effects of food and temperature on ant lion growth, body
   size, and survivorship. In the laboratory common-garden experiment,
   first-instar larvae from two southern (Georgia, South Carolina) and two
   northern (Connecticut, Rhode Island) populations were reared in
   incubators under high- and low-food and high- and low-temperature
   regimes. For all populations, high food increased final body mass and
   growth rate and decreased development time. Growth rates were higher at
   low temperatures, but temperature did not affect larval or adult body
   mass. Survivorship was highest in high-food and low-temperature
   treatments. Across all food and temperature treatments, northern
   populations exhibited a larger final body mass, shorter development
   time, faster growth rate, and greater survivorship than did southern
   populations. Results were similar for a field reciprocal-transplant
   experiment of third-instar larvae between populations in Connecticut and
   Oklahoma: Connecticut larvae grew faster than Oklahoma larvae,
   regardless of transplant site. Conversely, larvae transplanted to
   Oklahoma grew faster than larvae transplanted to Connecticut, regardless
   of population source. These results suggest that variation in food
   availability, not temperature, may account for differences in growth and
   body size of northern and southern ant lions. Although northern larvae
   grew faster and reached a larger body size in both experiments, northern
   environments should suppress growth because of reduced food availability
   and a limited growing season. This study provides the first example of
   countergradient selection causing Bergmann's rule in an ectotherm.

AB Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine the origin of the
   yeasts involved in the spontaneous alcoholic fermentation of an Alsatian
   wine.
   Methods and Results: During three successive years, must was collected
   at different stages of the winemaking process and fermented in the
   laboratory or in the cellar. Saccharomyces yeasts were sampled at the
   beginning and at the end of the fermentations. Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   clones were genetically characterized by inter-delta PCR. Non-S.
   cerevisiae clones were identified as Saccharomyces uvarum by PCR-RFLP on
   MET2 gene and characterized at the strain level by karyotyping. The
   composition of the Saccharomyces population in the vineyard, after
   crushing and in the vat was analyzed. This led to three main results.
   First, the vineyard Saccharomyces population was rather homogeneous.
   Second, new non-resident strains had appeared in the must during the
   winemaking process. Finally, the yeast population in the vat only
   consisted in S. uvarum strains.
   Conclusion: This 3-year study has enabled us to show the involvement of
   indigenous S. uvarum in the alcoholic fermentation.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study gives a first insight
   into the polymorphism of S. uvarum strains involved in a spontaneous
   alcoholic fermentation.

AB We examined morphological and genetic differences among Fennoscandian
   deer ked (Lipoptena cervi L, Hippoboscidae) populations with varying
   expansion history: the eastern population (Finland) has expanded
   rapidly, whereas the western population is divided into an old and
   relatively stationary sub-population in Sweden and a newly established
   and more expansive sub-population in Norway. The genetic analysis
   suggests that the distinct populations represent a single species.
   Individuals from expansive populations were characterized by a large
   body size, relatively large and robust thorax shape, and wing shape with
   an exaggerated basal posterior margin. Yet, there was no among
   population variation in relative wing size or its elongated shape after
   variation in overall size was controlled for. Although certain size and
   shape variables showed thermal sensitivity, the degree of plasticity did
   not differ between the populations. In general, we observed that shape
   is more sensitive to external thermal conditions at the pupal stage than
   size per se, with the thermal sensitivity of the latter depending on the
   trait under examination. We conclude that the possible adaptive value of
   morphological differences relies on variation in survival during the
   off-host life stages or short-distance flight to reach a susceptible
   host instead of long-distance dispersal ability.

AB We present an analysis of the mean climate and climatic trends of
   tropical rainforest regions over the period 1960-1998, with the aid of
   explicit maps of forest cover and climatological databases. Until the
   mid-1970s most regions showed little trend in temperature, and the
   western Amazon experienced a net cooling probably associated with an
   interdecadal oscillation. Since the mid-1970s, all tropical rainforest
   regions have experienced a strong warming at a mean rate of 0.26 +/-
   0.05 degreesC per decade, in synchrony with a global rise in temperature
   that has been attributed to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Over
   the study period, precipitation appears to have declined in tropical
   rainforest regions at a rate of 1.0 +/- 0.8% per decade (p < 5%),
   declining sharply in northern tropical Africa (at 3-4% per decade),
   declining marginally in tropical Asia and showing no significant trend
   in Amazonia. There is no evidence so far of a decline in precipitation
   in eastern Amazonia, a region thought vulnerable to
   climate-change-induced drying. The strong drying trend in Africa
   suggests that this should be a priority study region for understanding
   the impact of drought on tropical rainforests. We develop and use a
   dry-season index to study variations in the length and intensity of the
   dry season. Only African and Indian tropical rainforests appear to have
   seen a significant increase in dry-season intensity. In terms of
   interannual variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the
   primary driver of temperature variations across the tropics and of
   precipitation fluctuations for large areas of the Americas and southeast
   Asia. The relation between ENSO and tropical African precipitation
   appears less direct.

AB Solar irradiance is a key environmental control, and accurate spatial
   and temporal solar irradiance data are important for a wide range of
   applications related to energy and carbon cycling, weather prediction,
   and climate change. This study presents a satellite-based scheme for the
   retrieval of all-sky solar irradiance components, which links a
   physically based clear-sky model with a neural network version of a
   rigorous radiative transfer model. The scheme exploits the improved
   cloud characterization and retrieval capabilities of the MODerate
   resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua
   satellites, and employs a cloud motion tracking scheme for the
   production of hourly solar irradiance data throughout the day. The
   scheme was implemented for the Island of Zealand, Denmark (56 degrees N,
   12 degrees E) and Southern Arizona, USA (31 degrees N, 110 degrees W)
   permitting model evaluation for two highly contrasting climates and
   cloud environments. Information on the atmospheric state was provided by
   MODIS data products and verifications against AErosol RObotic NETwork
   (AERONET) data demonstrated usefulness of MODIS aerosol optical depth
   and total precipitable water vapour retrievals for the delineation of
   spatial gradients. However, aerosol retrievals were significantly biased
   for the semi-arid region, and water-vapour retrievals were characterized
   by systematic deviations from the measurements. Hourly global solar
   irradiance data were retrieved with overall root mean square deviations
   of 11.5% (60 W m(-2)) and 26.6% (72 W m(-2)) for Southern Arizona and
   the Island of Zealand, respectively. For both regions, hourly satellite
   estimates were shown to be more reliable than pyranometer measurements
   from ground stations only 15 km away from the point of interest, which
   is comparable to the accuracy level obtainable from geostationary
   satellites with image acquisitions every 15-30 min. The proposed scheme
   is particularly useful for solar irradiance mapping in highlatitude
   regions as data from geostationary satellites experience a gradual
   degradation in spatial resolution and overall quality with latitude and
   become unusable above approximately 60 degrees latitude. However, in
   principle, the scheme can be applied anywhere on the globe, and a
   synergistic use of MODIS and geostationary satellite datasets may be
   envisaged for some applications.

AB Plastic responses to changes in environmental conditions are ubiquitous
   and typically highly effective, but are predicted to incur costs. We
   here investigate the effects of different frequencies and magnitudes of
   temperature change in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana,
   considering developmental (Experiment 1) and adult stage plasticity
   (Experiment 2). We predicted negative effects of more frequent
   temperature changes on development, immune function and/or reproduction.
   Results from Experiment 1 showed that repeated temperature changes
   during development, if involving large amplitudes, negatively affect
   larval time, larval growth rate and pupal mass, while adult traits
   remained unaffected. However, results from treatment groups with smaller
   temperature amplitudes yielded no clear patterns. In Experiment 2
   prolonged but not repeated exposure to 39 degrees C increased heat
   tolerance, potentially reflecting costs of repeatedly activating
   emergency responses. At the same time fecundity was more strongly
   reduced in the group with prolonged heat stress, suggesting a trade-off
   between heat tolerance and reproduction. Clear effects were restricted
   to conditions involving large temperature amplitudes or high
   temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While rodents frequently host ectoparasites that can vector zoonotic
   diseases, often little is known about their ectoparasite communities,
   even in places where hosts frequently interact with humans. Yosemite
   National Park is an area of high human-wildlife interaction and high
   potential zoonotic disease transfer. Nonetheless, relatively few studies
   have surveyed the flea communities on mammalian hosts in this area, and
   even fewer have characterized the environmental and host factors that
   predict infestation. We focused on two species, the alpine chipmunk
   (Tamias alpinus) and the lodgepole chipmunk (T. speciosus), which
   inhabit Yosemite and surrounding areas and can host fleas that vector
   plague. Because these hosts are exhibiting differential responses to
   environmental change, it is valuable to establish baselines for their
   flea communities before further changes occur. We surveyed fleas on
   these chipmunk hosts during three years (2013-2015), including in the
   year of a plague epizootic (2015), and documented significant inter-host
   differences in flea communities and changes across years. Flea abundance
   was associated with host traits including sex and fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite levels. The average number of fleas per individual and the
   proportion of individuals carrying fleas increased across years for T.
   speciosus but not for T. alpinus. To better understand these patterns,
   we constructed models to identify environmental predictors of flea
   abundance for the two most common flea species, Ceratophyllus diktats
   mononis and Eumolpianus eumolpi. Results showed host-dependent
   differences in environmental predictors of flea abundance for E. eumolpi
   and C. diktats mononis, with notable ties to ambient temperature
   variation and elevation. These results provide insight into factors
   affecting flea abundance on two chipmunk species, which may be linked to
   changing climate and possible future plague epizootics.

AB The switch from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, i.e.
   flowering, is the critical event in a plant's life. Flowering is
   regulated either autonomously or by environmental factors; photoperiodic
   flowering, which is regulated by the duration of the day and night
   periods, and vernalization, which is regulated by low temperature, have
   been well studied. Additionally, it has become clear that stress also
   regulates flowering. Diverse stress factors can induce or accelerate
   flowering, or inhibit or delay it, in a wide range of plant species.
   This article focuses on the positive regulation of flowering via stress,
   i.e. the induction or acceleration of flowering in response to stress
   that is known as stress-induced flowering - a new category of flowering
   response. This review aims to clarify the concept of stress-induced
   flowering and to summarize the full range of characteristics of
   stress-induced flowering from a predominately physiological perspective.

AB Environmental temperature is an abiotic factor with great influence on
   biological processes of living beings. Jensen's inequality states that
   for non-lineal processes, such as most biological phenomena, the effects
   of thermal fluctuations cannot be predicted from mean constant
   temperatures. We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation
   (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and
   an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from
   egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect
   measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single
   blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C),
   or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into
   account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical
   distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment
   will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time
   and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in
   females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher
   body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime,
   suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments.
   At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would
   imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and,
   consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects. On
   the contrary, lower fecundity could be associated with a decrease in
   population growth. This knowledge will not only provide basic
   information to the field of insect ecophysiology, but also could be a
   useful background to develop population and disease transmission models.

AB The rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) can increase crop
   productivity, but there are likely to be intraspecific variations in the
   response. To meet future world food demand, screening for genotypes with
   high [CO2] responsiveness will be a useful option, but there is no
   criterion for high [CO2] responsiveness. We hypothesized that the
   Finlay-Wilkinson regression coefficient (RC) (for the relationship
   between a genotype's yield versus the mean yield of all genotypes in a
   specific environment) could serve as a pre-screening criterion for
   identifying genotypes that respond strongly to elevated [CO2]. We
   collected datasets on the yield of 6 rice and 10 soybean genotypes along
   environmental gradients and compared their responsiveness to elevated
   [CO2] based on the regression coefficients (i.e. the increases of yield
   per 100 mu mol mol(-1) [CO2]) identified in previous reports. We found
   significant positive correlations between the RCs and the responsiveness
   of yield to elevated [CO2] in both rice and soybean. This result raises
   the possibility that the coefficient of the Finlay-Wilkinson
   relationship could be used as a pre-screening criterion for [CO2]
   responsiveness.

AB Cultivation, in maximising environmental advantages and minimising
   disadvantages, allows fish to develop more rapidly than in the wild.
   Farmed salmon tend to smolt and mature younger than wild ones. Their
   developmental programme is genetically determined, but runs under
   environmental instruction. Their development may be altered by changing
   either the programme (genetically) or the instructions
   (environmentally), or both. In practice both are changed. but to varying
   degrees. Abundant food improves opportunities, and so developmental
   processes are generally accelerated by this and by genetic selection for
   high growth rate. While early smolting is commercially desirable.
   concomitant early maturation is not. Later development may be
   decelerated by food restriction at critical seasons. and by selection
   for late maturity. The environmental manipulations per se, of fish which
   subsequently escape from rearing facilities have little biological
   significance for wild stocks, although the presence of large numbers of
   small mature fish may present fishery management problems. However, the
   genetic manipulations pose potential problems. since the genotypes of
   these fish have been altered to suit culture rather than wild
   conditions.

AB The microvariant genotype of Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1 mu Var) has
   caused repeated seasonal outbreaks of mass mortality in Pacific oyster
   (Crassostrea gigas) populations in Europe, New Zealand and in New South
   Wales, Australia. The first occurrence of OsHV-1 related mortality in
   Tasmania, Australia was in January 2016; mortality was documented and
   multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to examine
   risk factors. Overall mortality was 78% but varied from 37%-92% across 6
   farms and between 96% (0-20 mm length) and 33% (61-115 mm) across size
   classes. The odds of mortality were 3.2 to 3.8 times greater for baskets
   containing oysters with an average shell length <= 40 mm compared to
   those with an average >61 mm. Generally, the greater the time on farm
   the lower the mortality, consistent with the increasing age and size of
   the oysters. The effect of stocking density on mortality changed with
   increasing time on farm (age). The standard density produced lower
   mortality than high or low stocking density particularly for spat.
   Mortality was nearly twice as likely when oysters were handled for
   routine husbandry in the 7 days prior to the outbreak compared to not
   handled. Ploidy and hatchery of origin did not alter the disease
   outcome. The variation in mortality with husbandry requires further
   investigation to determine if it can be exploited to help maintain
   productivity.
   Statement of relevance: This descriptive epidemiological study documents
   the impact of the first occurrence of disease associated with Ostreid
   herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) in Tasmania, Australia. OsHV-1 is an emerging and
   economically important pathogen. Describing the impact of OsHV-1 in new
   environments and identifying the association between farm management and
   mortality is important to develop effective disease control measures.

AB Climate change is affecting thermal conditions worldwide. Understanding
   organismal responses associated with predicted changes are essential for
   predicting population persistence. Few studies have examined the effects
   of both increased mean and variance in temperature on organismal traits,
   particularly during early life stages. Using lake sturgeon (Acipenser
   fulvescens) from Black Lake, MI, we tested whether phenotypic variation
   differed among families reared in two constant (10 and 18 degrees C) and
   two fluctuating-temperature treatments (10-19 degrees C) representing
   temperatures experienced in the river and a simulated anthropogenic
   disturbance. Body length, body area, and yolk-sac area were quantified
   at hatch. Family-by-treatment interactions explained up to 50% of the
   variance observed among families in offspring hatch traits. Families
   incubated in 18 degrees C and the fluctuating anthropogenic treatment
   had 6-10 times higher variance in traits than those incubated at 10
   degrees C. Hatched larvae were placed in raceways with ambient river
   water. Emergence body length, emergence timing, and growth were
   quantified upon emergence. Families differed in time to emergence and
   growth with the greatest range observed in the 18 degrees C treatment.
   Results demonstrate that differential responses among genotypes to
   changes in the mean and variability of thermal incubation regimes can
   affect traits at hatch as well as a subsequent ontogenetic stage.

AB Bacteria are one of the most abundant and diverse groups and mediate
   many critical terrestrial ecosystem processes. Despite the crucial
   ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale
   biogeography patterns across longitude (east-west transect), and the
   processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that
   of macro-organisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate
   the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving
   factors across different longitude sites along an 800-km east-west
   transect in the Loess Plateau. Twenty-four phyla were detected across
   all soil samples and the most sequence-abundant bacterial phyla were
   Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
   Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes (average relative abundance >5%). Soil
   bacterial a-diversity, expressed by the richness of soil bacterial
   communities and Shannon diversity, differed among climates (MAP) but
   showed strong correlations with MAP (r = -0.537 and r = -0.42,
   respectively: p < 0.05 in both bacterial diversity indices). Variation
   partition analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community structure
   was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic
   distance, which together explained 62% of the community variation. Soil
   properties contributed more to bacterial community variation than the
   combined geographic distance (historical contingencies) and climate
   factors. Among all environmental factors, soil pH exhibited a dominant
   role in structuring bacterial communities in this arid area. Our
   findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns in an
   arid area (MAP ranged from 473 mm to 547 mm). Additionally, the results
   indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial community, climate and
   edaphic variables, which is critical for predicting promoting
   sustainable ecosystem services in the Loess Plateau. (C) 2019 Elsevier

AB This work presents results which help to understand the behaviour of the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies over the South
   America continent during the two strongest El Nino events of the last
   century (1982-1983 and 1997-1998). The data used are parts of a
   long-term series ( July 1981 to December 1999) of calibrated NDVI data
   derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced
   Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) datasets. Special emphasis
   has been given to the analysis of the response of the major Brazilian
   vegetation types. This paper introduces an approach that enhances NDVI
   anomalies relative to the long-term climatology of the region. We find a
   negative NDVI anomaly for most of the region during the 1982-1983 event,
   whereas for the 1997-1998 event positive NDVI anomalies were observed
   over most regions. Only the 'Nordeste' region showed a similar
   vegetation response for both events. We identify three possible factors
   that may play a role in the different NDVI responses to the two El Nino
   events. Firstly, poor intercalibration of sensors may account for some,
   but not all of the differences. Secondly the response of the vegetation
   may depend upon the climate conditions prior to the El Nino events.
   Thirdly, the difference in the onset date and the duration of the mature
   phase of the two El Nino events, associated with very different Atlantic
   surface temperatures are shown to have dynamical consequences which may
   impact upon the vegetation.

AB Non-recombining sex chromosomes are expected to undergo evolutionary
   decay, ending up genetically degenerated, as has happened in birds and
   mammals. Why are then sex chromosomes so often homomorphic in
   cold-blooded vertebrates? One possible explanation is a high rate of
   turnover events, replacing master sex-determining genes by new ones on
   other chromosomes. An alternative is that X-Y similarity is maintained
   by occasional recombination events, occurring in sex-reversed XY
   females. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, we estimated
   the divergence times between European tree frogs (Hyla arborea, H.
   intermedia, and H. molleri) to the upper Miocene, about 5.4-7.1 million
   years ago. Sibship analyses of microsatellite polymorphisms revealed
   that all three species have the same pair of sex chromosomes, with
   complete absence of X-Y recombination in males. Despite this, sequences
   of sex-linked loci show no divergence between the X and Y chromosomes.
   In the phylogeny, the X and Y alleles cluster according to species, not
   in groups of gametologs. We conclude that sex-chromosome homomorphy in
   these tree frogs does not result from a recent turnover but is
   maintained over evolutionary timescales by occasional X-Y recombination.
   Seemingly young sex chromosomes may thus carry old-established
   sex-determining genes, a result at odds with the view that sex
   chromosomes necessarily decay until they are replaced. This raises
   intriguing perspectives regarding the evolutionary dynamics of sexually
   antagonistic genes and the mechanisms that control X-Y recombination.

AB BACKGROUND: In recent years, the impact of climate change on human
   health has attracted considerable attention; the effects on malaria have
   been of particular interest because of its disease burden and its
   transmission sensitivity to environmental conditions.
   OBJECTIVES: We investigated and illustrated the role that dynamic
   process-based mathematical models can play in providing strategic
   insights into the effects of climate change on malaria transmission.
   METHODS: We evaluated a relatively simple model that permitted valuable
   and novel insights into the simultaneous effects of rainfall and
   temperature on mosquito population dynamics, malaria invasion,
   persistence and local seasonal extinction, and the impact of seasonality
   on transmission. We illustrated how large-scale climate simulations and
   infectious disease systems may be modeled and analyzed and how these
   methods may be applied to predicting changes in the basic reproduction
   number of malaria across Tanzania.
   RESULTS: We found extinction to be more strongly dependent on rainfall
   than on temperature and identified a temperature window of around 32-33
   degrees C where endemic transmission and the rate of spread in
   disease-free regions is optimized. This window was the same for
   Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, but mosquito density played a
   stronger role in driving the rate of malaria spread than did the
   Plasmodium species. The results improved our understanding of how
   temperature shifts affect the global distribution of at-risk regions, as
   well as how rapidly malaria outbreaks take off within vulnerable
   populations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Disease emergence, extinction, and transmission all depend
   strongly on climate. Mathematical models offer powerful tools for
   understanding geographic shifts in incidence as climate changes.
   Nonlinear dependences of transmission on climate necessitates
   consideration of both changing climate trends and variability across
   time scales of interest.

AB The effect of incubation temperature on embryonic development and
   offspring traits has been widely reported for many species. However,
   knowledge remains limited about how such effects vary across
   populations. Here, we investigated whether incubation temperature (26,
   28, and 30 degrees C) differentially affects the embryonic development
   of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) eggs originating from
   low-latitude (Guangzhou, 23 degrees 06N) and high-latitude (Haining, 30
   degrees 19N) populations in China. At 26 degrees C, the duration of
   incubation was shorter in the high-latitude population than in the
   low-latitude population. However, this pattern was reversed at 30
   degrees C. As the incubation temperature increased, hatching success
   increased in the low-latitude population but slightly decreased in the
   high-latitude population. Hatchlings incubated at 30 degrees C were
   larger and righted themselves more rapidly than those incubated at 26
   degrees C in the low-latitude population. In contrast, hatchling traits
   were not influenced by incubation temperature in the high-latitude
   population. Overall, 30 degrees C was a suitable developmental
   temperature for embryos from the low-latitude population, whereas 26 and
   28 degrees C were suitable for those from the high-latitude population.
   This interpopulation difference in suitable developmental temperatures
   is consistent with the difference in the thermal environment of the two
   localities. Therefore, similarly to posthatching individuals, reptile
   embryos from different populations might have evolved diverse
   physiological strategies to benefit from the thermal environment in
   which they develop.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological

AB Reaction norms of wing length, thorax length, and ovariole number were
   studied according to growth temperature in the circumtropical Drosophila
   ananassae, and compared to similar data from the cosmopolitan D.
   melanogaster. In the two species convex reaction norms were observed,
   but they were not parallel and sometimes exhibited intersections either
   at high (wing) or at low (thorax) temperature. On average, D. ananassae
   may be considered as a species with a bigger thorax but shorter wings
   than D, melanogaster. The shapes of reaction norms were analyzed and
   compared after quadratic polynomial adjustments. Significant differences
   were observed, in several cases between polynomial parameters, and in
   all cases between characteristic points that is, Maximum Value (MV) and
   Temperature of Maximum Value (TMV). The wing/thorax ratio may also be
   considered as a specific trait related to wing loading. Major
   differences were observed between the two species for the mean value and
   the shape of the response curves of this trait. The main observation of
   this work was however a shift of TMVs for wing and thorax length and
   ovariole number in D. ananassae toward higher temperatures. These
   variations in the reaction norms corresponded to a shift in the species
   thermal range, suggesting that temperature adaptation was accompanied by
   a modification of the shape of the response curves.

AB The development of conservation genomics will be greatly aided by the
   use of neutral as well as adaptive molecular markers. Identifying novel
   adaptive molecular markers that have general application across diverse
   taxa is challenging, especially in Arthropods where few if any examples
   of balanced polymorphisms exist that are shared across species. A review
   of literature on the Pgi gene provides strong evidence for population
   level fitness consequences of genetic variation in this gene, across
   very diverse lineages of Arthropods. While these observations
   demonstrate the potential of using Pgi as an adaptive molecular marker,
   this gene is fundamentally different from the adaptive markers MHC and
   SI. Rather than providing insights into individual genetic health, Pgi
   appears to have a role in conservation genetics by providing insights
   into gene by environment interactions, local adaptation and evolutionary
   significant units, and potentially even morphologically cryptic
   dispersal phenotypes. These findings argue for studying Pgi variation in
   more species, as it appears central to the goals of conservation
   genomics.

AB Populations of common killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, are distributed
   along the Atlantic coast of North America through a steep latitudinal
   thermal gradient. We examined intraspecific variation in whole-animal
   thermal tolerance and its relationship to the heat shock response in
   killifish from the northern and southern extremes of the species range.
   Critical thermal maxima were significantly higher in southern than in
   northern fish by similar to 1.5 degrees C at a wide range of acclimation
   temperatures (from 2-34 degrees C), and critical thermal minima differed
   by similar to 1.5 degrees C at acclimation temperatures above 22 C,
   converging on the freezing point of brackish water at lower acclimation
   temperatures. To determine whether these differences in whole-organism
   thermal tolerance were reflected in differences in either the sequence
   or regulation of the heat shock protein genes ( hsps) we obtained
   complete cDNA sequences for hsc70, hsp70-1 and hsp70-2, and partial
   sequences of hsp90 alpha and hsp90 beta. There were no fixed differences
   in amino acid sequence between populations in either hsp70-1 or hsp70-2,
   and only a single conservative substitution between populations in
   hsc70. By contrast, there were significant differences between
   populations in the expression of many, but not all, of these genes. Both
   northern and southern killifish significantly increased hsp70-2 levels
   above control values ( Ton) at a heat shock temperature of 33 degrees C,
   but the magnitude of this induction was greater in northern fish,
   suggesting that northern fish may be more susceptible to thermal damage
   than are southern fish. In contrast, hsp70-1 mRNA levels increased
   gradually and to the same extent in response to heat shock in both
   populations. Hsc70 mRNA levels were significantly elevated by heat shock
   in southern fish, but not in northern fish. Similarly, the more
   thermotolerant southern killifish had a T-on for hsp90 alpha of 30
   degrees C, 2 degrees C lower than that of northern fish. This
   observation combined with the ability of southern killifish to
   upregulate hsc70 in response to heat shock suggests a possible role for
   these hsps in whole-organism differences in thermal tolerance. These
   data highlight the importance of considering the complexity of the heat
   shock response across multiple isoforms when attempting to make linkages
   to whole-organism traits such as thermal tolerance.

AB Bergmann's rule predicts an increase in body size with decreasing
   environmental temperature; however, the converse pattern has been found
   in the majority of lizards studied to date. For these ectotherms, small
   body size may provide thermal benefits (rapid heat uptake when basking),
   which would be highly advantageous in cold environments. Yet such an
   advantage may not exist in nocturnal lizards (which do not avidly bask),
   in which Bergmann's rule has not been closely studied. We have examined
   whether the body size of a primarily nocturnal gecko, Woodworthia
   "Otago/Southland" changed with elevation and operative temperature
   (determined using physical copper models). In a laboratory study, we
   investigated whether thermoregulatory mode (heliothermy or thigmothermy)
   alters the effect of body size on heating and cooling rates. This gecko
   followed Bergmann's rule, thereby showing the opposite of the dominant
   pattern in diurnal lizards. Size at maturity, maximum size of adults and
   size at birth were larger at higher elevations and at lower operative
   temperatures. Using physical models, we found that large body size can
   confer thermal benefits for nocturnal lizards that remain within diurnal
   retreats. Bergmann's rule should not be dismissed for all lizards. Our
   results clearly support Bergmann's rule for at least one thigmothermic
   species, for which large body size may provide thermal benefits. Future
   studies on Bergmann's rule in lizards should consider thermoregulatory
   mode. We advocate that this ecogeographic rule be examined in relation
   to operative temperature measured at field sites. Finally, we predict
   that climate warming may weaken the relationship between body size and
   elevation in this gecko.

AB Extreme climate events, such as the El Ninos in 1997/1998 and 2015/16,
   have led to considerable forest loss in the Southeast Asian region
   following unprecedented drought and wildfires. In Borneo, the effects of
   extreme climate events have been exacerbated by rapid urbanization,
   accelerated deforestation and soil erosion since the 1980s. However,
   studies quantifying the impact of interannual and long-term (>3 decades)
   climatic and anthropogenic change affecting Borneo's coastal and coral
   reef environments are lacking. Here, we used coral cores collected in
   Miri-Sibuti Coral Reefs National Park, Sarawak (Malaysia) to reconstruct
   the spatio-temporal dynamics of sea surface temperature and oxygen
   isotopic composition of seawater from 1982 to 2016, based on paired
   oxygen isotope and Sr/Ca measurements. The results revealed rising sea
   surface temperatures of 0.26 +/- 0.04 degrees C per decade since 1982.
   Reconstructed delta O-18(sw) displayed positive excursion during major
   El Nino events of 1983, 1997/98 and 2015/16, indicating drought
   conditions with less river runoff, rainfall and higher ocean salinities.
   La Ninas were generally associated with lower delta O-18(sw). We
   observed a long-term shift from more saline conditions between 1982 and
   1995 towards less saline conditions after 1995, which are in agreement
   with the regional freshening trend, punctuated by saline excursion
   during El Ninos. The decadal shifts were found to be driven by the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This study provides the first
   long-term data on El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven synchrony
   of climate impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems in northern
   Borneo. Our results suggest that coral records from northern Borneo are
   invaluable archives to detect regional ENSO and PDO impacts, and their
   interaction with the Asian-Australian monsoon, on the hydrological
   balance in the southern South China Sea beyond the past three decades.

AB Small-scale spatial and temporal variation in abiotic and biotic
   environmental conditions can lead to large differences in mean values of
   important life-history traits in ectothermic vertebrates, such as
   amphibians. However, relatively little is known about small-scale
   variation in life-history traits of sub-Arctic amphibians. We studied
   the spatio-temporal variation of adult life-history traits linked to age
   and body size in the common frog (Rana temporaria) from low (i.e.,
   valley at 480 m a.s.l.) and high (i.e., hill at 530-650 m a.s.l.)
   altitude sites in the sub-Arctic Kilpisjarvi area (Finland). Data on
   life-history traits of frogs from hill sites collected during a 3-year
   field study were compared with previously published data from the valley
   sites. The results showed spatio-temporal variation in life-history
   traits, frogs responding to spatio-temporal variation in the
   environmental conditions with variation in age, life span, survival

AB Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with
   oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has
   been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in
   space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight
   groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared
   spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them.
   Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal
   range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these
   parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial
   growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species
   exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino,
   which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in
   the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is
   brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed
   throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary
   productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size
   (L-infinity), with L-infinity increasing from south to north. This
   cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific
   case of the widely described Bergmann's rule, and we explore specific
   potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.

AB The number of rachis nodes (spikelets) on a wheat spike is a component
   of grain yield that correlates with flowering time. The genetic basis
   regulating flowering in cereals is well understood, but there are
   reports that flowering time can be modified at a high frequency by
   selective breeding, suggesting that it may be regulated by both
   epigenetic and genetic mechanisms. We investigated the role of DNA
   methylation in regulating spikelet number and flowering time by treating
   a semi-spring wheat with the demethylating agent, Zebularine. Three
   lines with a heritable increase in spikelet number were identified. The
   molecular basis for increased spikelet number was not determined in 2
   lines, but the phenotype showed non-Mendelian inheritance, suggesting
   that it could have an epigenetic basis. In the remaining line, the
   increased spikelet phenotype behaved as a Mendelian recessive trait and
   late flowering was associated with a deletion encompassing the floral
   promoter, FT-B1. Deletion of FT-B1 delayed the transition to
   reproductive growth, extended the duration of spike development, and
   increased spikelet number under different temperature regimes and
   photoperiod. Transiently disrupting DNA methylation can generate novel
   flowering behaviour in wheat, but these changes may not be sufficiently
   stable for use in breeding programs.

AB Based in part on a symposium held at the first World Seabird Conference
   in September, 2010 in Victoria, BC, Canada, we present a Theme Section
   (TS) on the topic of seabirds and climate change. We introduce this TS
   with a meta-analysis of key attributes of the current seabird-climate
   literature, based on 108 publications representing almost 3000
   seabird-climate associations (mostly correlations) published up to 2011.
   Using the papers in this TS and our meta-analysis, a brief roadmap for
   the future of seabird-climate change research is presented. Seabird
   studies have contributed substantially to the literature on marine
   climate effects. To improve our understanding of climate change effects
   on seabirds at the global scale, however, additional low-latitude,
   mechanistic, and 'end-to-end' modeling studies, including integration of
   climatic, oceanographic, food web, and population dynamics models,
   should be conducted. This approach will enhance our understanding of the
   relationship between climate and population dynamics, and facilitate
   seabird conservation in a changing world.

AB The microbiological safety and quality of Refrigerated Processed Foods
   of Extended Durability (REPFEDs) relies on a combination of mild heat
   treatment and refrigeration, sometimes in combination with other
   inhibitory agents that are ineffective when used alone. In this context,
   a predictive model describing the time-to-detect growth (measured by
   turbidimetry) of psychrotrophic Bacillus cereus spores submitted to
   various combinations of pH, water activity (a(w)), heat treatment and
   storage temperature was developed. As the inoculum was high, the
   time-to-detect growth was the sum of two times: for a large part of the
   spore lag time (time before germination and outgrowth) and to a lesser
   extent of the time to have subsequent vegetative cells growing up to a
   detectable level.
   A dataset of 434 combinations (of pH, a(w), heat treatment, storage
   temperature and B. cereus strain), originally collected at Ghent
   University to build a growth/no-growth model for two Bacillus cereus
   strains, was re-interpreted as time-to-detect growth values. In the
   growth area (223 combinations) the time-to-detect growth was set as the
   longest time where none, or only one, of the 8 replicated wells showed
   growth. In the no-growth area (211 combinations) the time-to-detect
   growth was set as longer than the time where the experiment was stopped
   (60 days or more) and analysed as a censored response. The factors of
   variation were heat-treatment intensity (85 degrees C, 87 degrees C and
   90 degrees C in a time range of 1 to 38 min), storage temperature (8-30
   degrees C), pH (5.2-6.4) and a(w) (0.973-0.995). Two different strains
   were analysed. The model had a Gamma multiplicative structure; it was
   solved by Bayesian inference with informative prior distributions. To be
   implemented in a decision tool, for instance to calculate the process
   and formulation conditions required to achieve a given detection time,
   each Gamma term had some constraints: they had to be monotonous,
   continuous and algebraically simple mathematical functions (i.e. having
   analytical solution).
   Overall, the cumulative effect of various stressful conditions
   (pasteurisation process, low temperature, and low pH) enables to extend
   the time-to-detect growth up to 60 days or more, whereas the
   heat-treatment on its own did not have a similar effect. For example,
   with the most heat resistant strain (strain 1, FF140), for a product at
   a(w) 0.99, stored at 10 degrees C, heat-treated at 90 degrees C for 10
   min, a time-to-detect growth of 2 days was expected when the pH equalled
   6.5. Under the same conditions, if the pH was reduced to 5.8, the
   time-to-detect growth was predicted to bell days (and 33 days at pH
   5.5). After a pasteurisation at 90 degrees C for 10 min, for a product
   kept at 10 degrees C, combinations of pH and a(w) such as pH 6.0-a(w)
   0.97, pH 5.7-a(w) 0.98 or pH 5.5-a(w) 0.99 were predicted to extend the
   time-to-detect growth up to 30 days. The developed model is a useful
   tool for REPFED producers to guarantee the safety of their products
   towards psychrotrophic B. cereus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Climate change constitutes a major challenge for high productivity in
   wheat, the most widely grown crop in Germany. Extreme weather events
   including dry spells and heat waves, which negatively affect wheat
   yields, are expected to aggravate in the future. It is crucial to
   improve the understanding of the spatiotemporal development of such
   extreme weather events and the respective crop-climate relationships in
   Germany. Thus, the present study is a first attempt to evaluate the
   historic development of relevant drought and heat-related extreme
   weather events from 1901 to 2010 on county level (NUTS-3) in Germany.
   Three simple drought indices and two simple heat stress indices were
   used in the analysis. A continuous increase in dry spells over time was
   observed over the investigated periods from 1901-1930, 1931-1960,
   1961-1990 to 2001-2010. Short and medium dry spells, i.e.,
   precipitation-free periods longer than 5 and 8 days, respectively,
   increased more strongly compared to longer dry spells (longer than 11
   days). The heat-related stress indices with maximum temperatures above
   25 and 28 A degrees C during critical wheat growth phases showed no
   significant increase over the first three periods but an especially
   sharp increase in the final 1991-2010 period with the increases being
   particularly pronounced in parts of Southwestern Germany. Trend analysis
   over the entire 110-year period using Mann-Kendall test revealed a
   significant positive trend for all investigated indices except for heat
   stress above 25 A degrees C during flowering period. The analysis of
   county-level yield data from 1981 to 2010 revealed declining spatial
   yield variability and rather constant temporal yield variability over
   the three investigated (1981-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2010) decades. A
   clear spatial gradient manifested over time with variability in the West
   being much smaller than in the east of Germany. Correlating yield
   variability with the previously analyzed extreme weather indices
   revealed strong spatiotemporal fluctuations in explanatory power of the
   different indices over all German counties and the three time periods.
   Over the 30 years, yield deviations were increasingly well correlated
   with heat and drought-related indices, with the number of days with
   maximum temperature above 25 A degrees C during anthesis showing a sharp
   increase in explanatory power over entire Germany in the final 2001-2010
   period.

AB A major aim of the aquaculture industry in Norway is to develop
   sustainable farming of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. A great deal of
   research, including fanning trials and stock enhancement, has been
   performed on this species in Norway during the past two decades. The
   success of domestication of a new species depends on the genetic
   variability of the wild broodstock and the selection of appropriate
   genotypes for the fanning environment. Growth experiments under fanned
   conditions, including genetic analyses, were started as early as 1983
   after the breakthrough of cod juvenile production in mesocosm systems.
   At later stages (1988 and 1992 year classes), more detailed studies were
   conducted under farmed conditions. Based on individual tagging and
   genotyping (blood and white muscle biopsy sampling), estimates of growth
   performance (specific growth rate, SGR) of the various genotypes within
   six polymorphic protein loci were obtained. In general, the SGR in the
   two experiments varied through the year as a function of temperature and
   body size. In the 1988 year-class experiment, only a few statistically
   significant differences (ANOVA) were detected among genotypes, measured
   as mean weight and SGR. The 1992 year-class experiment included two
   different cod stocks, Northeast Arctic (NE) and Norwegian coastal (NC)
   cod, which were reared for about two years in the same net pen. Further,
   during this experiment, only a few genotypes exhibited significantly
   different growth within the NE group. No consistency was found in the
   variation with regard to protein loci investigated, growth periods
   studied, and relationship with temperature variation. (c) 2005

AB The mechanisms that underlie thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms
   remain unresolved. Triploid fish have been reported to exhibit lower
   thermal tolerance than diploids, offering a potential model organism to
   better understand the physiological drivers of thermal tolerance. Here,
   we compared triploid and diploid juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   in freshwater to investigate the proposed link between aerobic capacity
   and thermal tolerance. We measured specific growth rates (SGR) and
   resting (aerobic) metabolic rates (RMR) in freshwater at 3, 7 and 9
   weeks of acclimation to 10, 14 and 18 degrees C. Additionally, maximum
   metabolic rates (MMR) were measured at 3 and 7 weeks of acclimation, and
   critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were measured at 9 weeks. Mass, SGR and
   RMR differed between ploidies across all temperatures at the beginning
   of the acclimation period, but all three metrics were similar across
   ploidies by week 7. Aerobic scope (MMR-RMR) remained consistent across
   ploidies, acclimation temperatures and time. At 9 weeks, CTmax was
   independent of ploidy, but correlated positively with acclimation
   temperature despite the similar aerobic scope between acclimation
   groups. Our findings suggest that acute thermal tolerance is not
   modulated by aerobic scope, and the altered genome of triploid Atlantic
   salmon does not translate to reduced thermal tolerance of juvenile fish
   in freshwater.

AB We examined the structure-function relationships that underlie the
   aerobic capacities of marsupial mammals that hop. Marsupials have
   relatively low basal metabolic rates (BMR) and historically were seen as
   'low energy' mammals. However, the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus (family
   Macropodidae), has aerobic capacities equivalent to athletic placentals.
   It has an extreme aerobic scope (fAS) and its large locomotor muscles
   feature high mitochondrial and capillary volumes. M. rufus belongs to a
   modern group of kangaroos and its high fAS is not general for
   marsupials. However, other hopping marsupials may have elevated aerobic
   capacities. Bettongia penicillata, a rat-kangaroo (family Potoroidae),
   is a small (1 kg), active hopper whose fAS is somewhat elevated. We
   examined the oxygen delivery system in its muscles to ascertain links
   with hopping. An elevated fAS of 23 provided a relatively high maximal
   aerobic oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2,max)) in B. penicillata;
   associated with this is a skeletal muscle mass of 44% of body mass. Ten
   muscles were sampled to estimate the total mitochondrial and capillary
   volume of the locomotor muscles. Values in B. penicillata were similar
   to those in M. rufus and in athletic placentals. This small hopper had
   high muscle mitochondrial volume densities (7.1-11.9%) and both a large
   total capillary volume (6 ml kg(-1) body mass) and total capillary
   erythrocyte volume (3.2 ml kg(-1)). Apparently, a considerable aerobic
   capacity is required to achieve the benefits of the extended stride in
   fast hopping. Of note, the ratio of (V) over dot(O2,max) to total muscle
   mitochondrial volume in B. penicillata was 4.9 ml O-2 min(-1) ml(-1).
   Similar values occur in M. rufus and also placental mammals generally,
   not only athletic species. If such relationships occur in other
   marsupials, a fundamental structure-function relationship for oxygen
   delivery to muscles likely originated with or before the earliest
   mammals.

AB We reconstructed the past coastal environment of the Baltic Sea from c.
   7300 to 3500cal. a BP, with a focus on sea surface salinity (SSS). To
   quantitatively determine the SSS, two methods were employed:
   measurements of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in mollusc shells (SSSSr) and process
   length variations of dinoflagellate cysts Operculodinium centrocarpum
   (SSSpl). The SSSSr was similar to 6-7 between 6800 and 6400cal. a BP,
   similar to modern conditions. Between 6000 and 3900cal. a BP, SSSSr was
   consistently higher, ranging between similar to 9 and 13. Microfossils
   sensitive to salinity variations, such as Radiosperma corbiforum and
   Spiniferites spp., support the SSSSr estimate. In comparison with the
   SSSSr, the SSSpl values were consistently higher, with an average of
   similar to 14. We suggest SSSpl tend to overestimate salinity and are
   not as reliable as SSSSr. A multi-proxy approach, including analysis of
   microfossil, organic carbon content, C/N ratios and grain-size, allowed
   for a division of the study period into three zones (Zones I-III). Zone
   I (7300-6400cal. a BP) is characterized by relatively O.centrocarpum and
   R.corbiforum concentrations, silt contents and C/N ratios, corresponding
   to the regional Littorina transgression maximum. Zone II (6400-3900cal.
   a BP) is characterized by increased Spiniferites spp. and decreased
   R.corbiforum abundances, and by lowered C/N ratios and silt contents
   relative to Zone I. Zone III (3900-3500cal. a BP) represents the start
   of the Post-Littorina Sea phase, indicating a shift to the modern Baltic
   Sea phase with decreased salinity.

AB Environmental variables are pivotal factors for the condition of marine
   invertebrate species with a complex life cycle, influencing larval
   biochemical composition, and therefore, indirectly affecting later
   benthic stages. We herein explore the physiological responses of the
   fishery resource the red squat lobster (Pleuroncodes monodon) under
   contrasting environmental conditions of seawater surface temperature and
   planktonic food availability on the Humboldt Current System (HCS),
   through the analysis of larval condition and its consequences in the
   HCS. Larval condition was measured as dry weight, biochemical
   composition and fatty acids profile at hatching during 'late summer'
   (i.e. March) and 'early winter' (i.e. June). Larvae hatching from larger
   eggs produced in winter months showed a higher size, dry weight and a
   higher content of bioenergetic fuel (i.e. lipids and essential fatty
   acids) compared to those from larvae hatching in summer months.
   Temperature and food availability can to be key driving factors
   favouring an evolution of temporal variability in larval condition of
   the red squat lobster. These physiological adaptations provide an
   extension of the reproductive period of P. monodon, specifically
   planktonic larval development during 'early winter', characterized by a

AB The two paper wasps, Polistes dominula and Polistes gallicus, are
   related species with strongly differing distribution ranges. We
   investigated thermal tolerance traits (critical thermal limits and
   metabolic response to temperature) to gain knowledge about physiological
   adaptations to their local climate conditions and to get evidence for
   the reasons of P. dominula's successful dispersion. Body and ambient
   temperature measurements at the nests revealed behavioural adaptations
   to microclimate. The species differed clearly in critical thermal
   minimum (P. dominula -1.4 degrees C, P. gallicus -0.4 degrees C), but
   not significantly in critical thermal maximum of activity (P. dominula
   47.1 degrees C, P. gallicus 47.6 degrees C). The metabolic response did
   not reveal clear adaptations to climate conditions. At low and high
   temperatures, the metabolic rate of P. dominula was higher, and at
   intermediate temperatures, we determined higher values in P. gallicus.
   However, the species exhibited remarkably differing thermoregulatory
   behaviour at the nest. On average, P. gallicus tolerated a thoracic
   temperature up to similar to 41 degrees C, whereas P. dominula already
   tried at similar to 37 degrees C to keep the thorax below ambient
   temperature. We suggest this to be an adaptation to the higher mean
   ambient temperature we measured at the nest during a breeding season.
   Although we determined for P. dominula a 0.5 degrees C larger thermal
   tolerance range, we do not presume this parameter to be solely
   responsible for the successful distribution of P. dominula. Additional
   factors, such as the thermal tolerance of the queens could limit the
   overwintering success of P. gallicus in a harsher climate.

AB Drosophila littoralis is a latitudinally widespread European species of
   the Drosophila virilis group. The species has ample genetic variation in
   photoperiodism (adult diapause) and circadian rhythmicity (pupal
   eclosion rhythm), with adaptive latitudinal clines in both of them. The
   possible common genetic basis between the variability of photoperiodism
   and circadian rhythms was studied by a long-term crossing experiment. A
   northerri strain (65 degrees N) having long critical day length (CDL =
   19.9 h) for diapause, early phase of the entrained rhythm in LD 3:21
   (Psi(LD 3:21) = 12.3 h), and short period (tau = 18.8 h) of the
   free-running rhythm for the eclosion rhythm was crossed with a southern
   strain (42 degrees N) having short CDL (12.4 h), late eclosion phase
   (Psi(LD) 3:21 = 20.2 h), and long period (tau = 22.8 h). After 54
   generations, including free recombination, artificial selection, and
   genetic drift, a novel strain resulted, having even more "southern"
   diapause and more "northern" eclosion rhythm characteristics than found
   in any of the geographical strairts. The observed complete separation of
   eclosion rhythm characteristics from photoperiodism is a new finding in
   D. littoralis; in earlier studies followed for 16 generations, the
   changes had been mostly parallel. Evidently, the genes controlling the
   variability of the eclosion rhythm and photoperiodism in D. littoralis
   are different but closely linked. To test for the possible gene loci
   underlying the observed geographical variability, the period gene was
   studied in 10 strains covering all the known clock variability in D.
   littoralis. The authors sequenced the most suspected Thr-Gly region,
   which is known to take part in the adaptive clock variability in
   Drosophila melanogaster. No coding differences were found in the
   strains, showing that this region is not included in the adaptive clock
   variability in D. littoralis.

AB Morphological anomalies are most frequently noted in adult ticks.
   Therefore, in this paper, we describe interesting morphological
   anomalies in Hyalomma marginatum larvae from a laboratory-reared colony
   of Syrian specimens. Specimens with abnormalities were found among many
   thousands of larvae and analysed using scanning electron microscopy.
   Additionally, we analysed changes in the morphological traits (length
   and width of tarsi I and III; length and width of coxae I, II, and III)
   in abnormal specimens of H. marginatum larvae. Teratological changes
   were noted in the larval gnathosoma (reduction or elongation of
   chelicerae and change in the location of chelicerae on the basis
   capituli; abnormal shape and size of the palpal segment) and legs
   (fusion of four segments of adjacent legs and deformations of leg
   segments). The investigations have shown low variability of the
   morphometric traits of tarsi I and III as well as coxae I, II, and III
   in the H. marginatum larvae from the Syrian population, which can be
   used in the diagnostics of this species. Knowledge of different types of
   anomalies in tick larvae can prevent mistakes in identification of
   abnormal specimens collected in natural conditions.

AB Sample Entropy (SampEn) has been proposed as a method to overcome
   limitations associated with approximate entropy (ApEn). The initial
   paper describing the SampEn metric included a characterization study
   comparing both ApEn and SampEn against theoretical results and concluded
   that SampEn is both more consistent and agrees more closely with theory
   for known random processes than ApEn. SampEn has been used in several
   studies to analyze the regularity of clinical and experimental time
   series. However, questions regarding how to interpret SampEn in certain
   clinical situations and its relationship to classical signal parameters
   remain unanswered. In this paper we report the results of a
   characterization study intended to provide additional insights regarding
   the interpretability of SampEn in the context of biomedical signal

AB With the implementation of the Chinese Natural Forest Conservation
   Program (NFCP) in 1998, over millions of hectares of forest in
   northeastern China have been protected through natural restoration
   (closure of hills). The impact of this program on the carbon budget of
   soil has not been evaluated until now. This paper presents results from
   a 6-year study of total CO2 efflux from both soil and litter (R-total),
   CO2 flux from soil (R-soil), soil organic matter (SOM), soil microbe
   density, and litter input and root biomass at an uncut larch (Larix
   gmelinii) forest and at a natural restoration site. The natural
   restoration area is a clear-cut site that was formerly part of a
   continuous portion of the uncut larch forest. Our objectives were to:
   (1) quantify the magnitude of CO2 efflux from typical sites in
   northeastern China; (2) explore the changes in thermal conditions, SOM,
   and annual CO2 flux during the 6-year natural restoration, and (3)
   evaluate the impact of NFCP on soil carbon processes. The annual R-soil
   at the clear-cut site (58.6-68.2 mol m(-2) year(-1)) was 113.6-228.4% (
   mean 141.5%) higher than that at the uncut larch site (29.6-58.4 mol
   m(-2) year(-1)). At the same time, annual CO2 from litter at the
   clear-cut site (2.0-14.2 mol m(-2) year(-1)) was only 23.5-84.5% (mean
   52.5%) of that at the uncut larch site (5.4-16.8 mol m(-2) year(-1)).
   SOM at the surface layer of the clear-cut site was 75% of that at the
   uncut larch site, but the soil microbial biomass (carbon) at the
   clear-cut site was much higher than that at the larch site (p < 0.05).
   The percentage of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes also were largely
   different between both sites. Natural restoration at the clear-cut site
   strongly affected thermal conditions. Although the soil temperature
   (T-soil) and effective accumulated T-soil > 0 degrees C at the clear-cut
   site was much higher, the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) was much lower
   than that at the uncut larch site, and their differences decreased
   linearly from 2001 to 2006 (p < 0.05). Moreover, Q(10) at the clear-cut
   site significantly increased with the progress of natural restoration,
   which diminished the Q(10) difference between the two sites (slope =
   -0.2792, r(2) = 0.4744, p < 0.05). These data imply that the NFCP
   natural restoration process has positively recovered the thermal
   condition of the clear-cut site to the level of uncut larch forest
   during the 6-year period. However, linear regression analysis showed
   that the 6-year natural restoration only slightly affected the annual
   soil CO2 efflux and SOM at both sites, and also did not diminish the
   differences between the two sites (p > 0.10), indicating that a much
   longer time is necessary to restore the soil carbon in the clear-cut
   site.

AB African forests within the Congo Basin are generally mapped at a
   regional scale as broad-leaved evergreen forests, with the main
   distinction being between terra-firme and swamp forest types. At the
   same time, commercial forest inventories, as well as national maps, have
   highlighted a strong spatial heterogeneity of forest types. A detailed
   vegetation map generated using consistent methods is needed to inform
   decision makers about spatial forest organization and their
   relationships with environmental drivers in the context of global
   change. We propose a multi-temporal remotely sensed data approach to
   characterize vegetation types using vegetation index annual profiles.
   The classifications identified 22 vegetation types (six savannas, two
   swamp forests, 14 forest types) improving existing vegetation maps.
   Among forest types, we showed strong variations in stand structure and
   deciduousness, identifying (i) two blocks of dense evergreen forests
   located in the western part of the study area and in the central part on
   sandy soils; (ii) semi-deciduous forests are located in the Sangha River
   interval which has experienced past fragmentation and human activities.
   For all vegetation types enhanced vegetation index profiles were highly
   seasonal and strongly correlated to rainfall and to a lesser extent, to
   light regimes. These results are of importance to predict spatial
   variations of carbon stocks and fluxes, because evergreen/deciduous
   forests (i) have contrasted annual dynamics of photosynthetic activity
   and foliar water content and (ii) differ in community dynamics and
   ecosystem processes.

   seasonal forecasting, numerical modelling (both atmospheric and
   oceanic), and the physical oceanography of the Agulhas and Benguela
   current systems. Most but not all of the atmospheric science papers
   relate to South Africa or southern Africa; however, some work pertaining
   to the southern hemisphere as a whole or to other regions has been done.
   We note that funding and institutional support for atmospheric science
   and physical oceanography research in South Africa remains poor and this
   situation significantly hampers local efforts.

AB Edible crab, Cancer pagurus, is a valuable North Atlantic fishery
   resource distributed from Morocco to northern Norway, covering a wide
   range of temperatures and other oceanographic variables. Knowledge on
   how local environmental conditions affect life history traits like
   maturity and growth in this species is however lacking, despite its
   importance in science-based management. Through analyses of field data
   and fishers' reports from different areas along the west coast of Norway
   (between 59 degrees N and 69 degrees N), latitudinal differences in size
   at onset of sexual maturity and molting probabilities of female C.
   pagurus were investigated. The size at which 50% of crabs were found to
   be mature (CW50) did not differ between areas and was consistent with
   historical investigations, i.e. overall CW50 : 112.3 mm, and CW50 for
   each area/year between 108 and 117 mm. Generalized additive modelling
   was used to predict probability of molting (occurrence of soft crabs)
   during late summer/autumn, with 'area' as a categorical variable, and
   'day of year' and crab size as continuous non-linear predictors. The
   predictor variables had low explanatory power (16.4% deviance explained
   by full model), demonstrating the complexity of the process regulating
   molting. However, frequency of molting decreases and peak periods of
   molting occur later at higher latitudes, suggesting that lower
   temperatures have an impeding effect on growth in northern populations.
   Overall, our findings suggest that current minimum legal catch sizes for
   crabs in Norwegian waters are sufficient to restrict the catch of
   immature females, but that crabs in different geographical regions
   appear to be variably tolerant to fishing pressure following differences
   in growth.

AB Restriction endonuclease analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were used
   to examine genetic variability and population structure in Leptinotarsa
   decemlineata (Say). A group of three enzymes, EcoRI, HpaI, and PstI, was
   used to reveal polymorphism both within and among some of the 10
   populations tested yielding 16 haplotypes in combination. The
   frequencies of these 16 haplotypes differed significantly across
   geographic regions, indicating some partitioning of mtDNA haplotypes.
   Estimates of mtDNA sequence divergence (delta) between haplotypes ranged
   from 0.016 to 0.135%, suggesting local differentiation of mtDNA in some
   populations. Analysis of these data suggests that Texas was colonized by
   more than one mtDNA lineage, most likely originating in Mexico. We
   hypothesize that a larger founder size for the initial introductions or
   high levels of variability in the parent population at the edge of the
   CPB expanding range led to the initial partitioning of haplotypes
   observed in samples from Texas.

   the following day in the morning and afternoon. Eleven subjects
   participated in the study, during which we measured the maximal, peak,
   and mean powers (i.e., Pmax [force-velocity test], Ppeak, and Pmean
   [Wingate test], respectively). Measurements were performed twice daily,
   at 07:00 and 18:00h, following a reference normal sleep night (RN), a
   partial sleep deprivation timed at the beginning of the night (SDB), and
   a partial sleep deprivation timed at the end of the night (SDE), and
   oral temperature was measured every 4h. Each of the three experimental
   conditions was separated by a one-week period. Our results showed a
   circadian rhythm in oral temperature, and analysis of variance revealed
   a significant sleeptest-time effect on peak power (Ppeak), mean power
   (Pmean), and maximal power (Pmax). These variables improved
   significantly from the morning to the afternoon for all three
   experimental conditions. Whereas the morning-afternoon improvement in
   the measures was similar after the RN and SDB conditions, it was smaller
   following the SDE condition. There was no significant difference in the
   effect of the two sleep-deprivation conditions on anaerobic performances
   at 07:00 and at 18:00h under the SDB condition in comparison with the
   post-reference night. However, the performance variables were
   significantly lower at 18:00h after the SDE condition. In conclusion, a
   4h partial sleep deprivation at the end of the night appears to be more
   disturbing than partial sleep deprivation at the beginning of the night.

   collected from the commercial fishing beds off Digby, Nova Scotia,
   Canada. The study was designed to examine the effects of and
   interactions between scallop size and position within the bed and
   interannual variability in adductor muscle RNA/DNA. The smallest size
   class of scallops had significantly higher RNA/DNA values than the two
   larger size-classes. A consistent fine-scale spatial patchiness in
   RNA/DNA was observed. In the Digby area this pattern showed an

AB Mitochondrial performance may play a role in setting whole-animal
   thermal tolerance limits and their plasticity, but the relative roles of
   adjustments in mitochondrial performance across different highly aerobic
   tissues remain poorly understood. We compared heart and brain
   mitochondrial responses to acute thermal challenges and to thermal
   acclimation using high-resolution respirometry in two locally adapted
   subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). We predicted
   that 5 degrees C acclimation would result in compensatory increases in
   mitochondrial performance, while 33 degrees C acclimation would cause
   suppression of mitochondrial function to minimize the effects of high
   temperature on mitochondrial metabolism. In contrast, acclimation to
   both 33 and 5 degrees C decreased mitochondrial performance compared
   with fish acclimated to 15 degrees C. These adjustments could represent
   an energetic cost-saving mechanism at temperature extremes. Acclimation
   responses were similar in both heart and brain; however, this effect was
   smaller in the heart, which might indicate its importance in maintaining
   whole-animal thermal performance. Alternatively, larger acclimation
   effects in the brain might indicate greater thermal sensitivity compared
   with the heart. We detected only modest differences between subspecies
   that were dependent on the tissue assayed. These data demonstrate
   extensive plasticity in mitochondrial performance following thermal
   acclimation in killifish, and indicate that the extent of these
   responses differs between tissues, highlighting the importance and
   complexity of mitochondrial regulation in thermal acclimation in
   eurytherms.

AB For many oviparous animals, incubation temperature influences sex
   through temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Although climate
   change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods
   predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on
   mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing
   methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the
   probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach
   subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by
   integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent
   reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used
   method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent
   (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new
   approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We
   experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM
   method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the
   variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the
   PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests
   over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM
   approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD,
   particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate
   change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up
   to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting
   that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our
   data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles
   possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.

AB Hydrological and thermal river regimes have changed greatly due to the
   construction of reservoirs and dams. Water temperature changes have
   important significance for aquatic habitats and freshwater ecosystems.
   To investigate the impact of large reservoirs on the water temperature
   regime along the middle reach of the Yangtze River, we present a
   probabilistic modeling framework to ascertain the joint dependence
   structures of air-water temperature and discharge-water temperature
   between pre-reservoir and post-reservoir periods based on the copula
   theory. The results show that the principle of maximum entropy (POME)
   method can better estimate the marginal distributions of temperature
   regimes. Reservoir operation disturbed the dependence structures of
   air-water temperature, especially after the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR)
   was put into operation. Different shifts in the occurrence probabilities
   of high or low water temperatures at the downstream and upstream
   stations under extreme air temperature and discharge are observed,
   indicating the great effects of reservoirs on the dependence structures
   of the downstream river flow and thermal regime. Relying on the
   developed model, we propose the appropriate ranges of air temperature
   and discharge to maintain a suitable water temperature for Chinese
   sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) spawning activity. The results of this
   study demonstrate the influence of dams on the thermal regime and can be
   helpful for optimizing reservoir operations to enhance biological
   conservation in the Yangtze River.

AB Seed quality and seedling establishment are the most important factors
   affecting successful crop development. They depend on the genetic
   background and are acquired during seed maturation and therefor,
   affected by the maternal environment under which the seeds develop.
   There is little knowledge about the genetic and environmental factors
   that affect seed quality and seedling establishment. The aim of this
   study is to identify the loci and possible molecular mechanisms involved
   in acquisition of seed quality and how these are controlled by adverse
   maternal conditions. For this, we used a tomato recombinant inbred line
   (RIL) population consisting of 100 lines which were grown under two
   different nutritional environmental conditions, high phosphate and low
   nitrate. Most of the seed germination traits such as maximum germination
   percentage (G(max)), germination rate (t(50)) and uniformity (U-8416)
   showed ample variation between genotypes and under different germination
   conditions. This phenotypic variation leads to identification of
   quantitative trait loci (QTLs) which were dependent on genetic factors,
   but also on the interaction with the maternal environment (QTL x E).
   Further studies of these QTLs may ultimately help to predict the effect
   of different maternal environmental conditions on seed quality and
   seedling establishment which will be very useful to improve the
   production of high-performance seeds.

AB Reproductive success in thermally varying environments will depend on
   maintaining metabolic capacity of tissues that are important in mating
   behaviours. Here we test the hypothesis that cold acclimation will occur
   in those tissues that are important for reproduction, and that
   acclimation will be sex specific, reflecting behavioural differences
   between the sexes. We used the frog Limnodynastes peronii as a model
   because anurans engage in energetically demanding reproductive
   behaviour, and many species, including L. peronii, are reproductively
   active across seasons. Additionally, reproductive behaviours such as
   calling and amplexus are sex specific. We acclimated animals to
   naturally occurring autumn ( 15 C, N= 10) and summer ( 25 C, N= 10)
   temperatures. Whole-animal resting oxygen consumption decreased with
   lowered temperature, but there was no difference in oxygen consumption
   between acclimation treatments or sexes. However, the respiratory
   control ratio ( RCR) of mitochondria from the liver and external oblique
   calling muscle increased with cold acclimation. The increase in RCR with
   thermal acclimation was due to upregulation of state 3 respiration, and
   not to a decrease in state 4 respiration. Males had higher activity of
   citrate synthase, beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase and cytochrome c
   oxidase than females in the calling ( external oblique) muscle, and
   males also showed thermal acclimation of these enzymes while females did
   not. Additionally, males had greater activity of metabolic enzymes in
   the principal muscle ( extensor carpi radialis) used during amplexus.
   However, there were no differences in metabolic capacity between sexes
   in the gastrocnemius muscle and in liver, and both sexes showed
   significant acclimation of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c
   oxidase in the former and latter, respectively. In L. peronii, thermal
   acclimation of metabolic capacities is linked to reproductive success,
   and reversible phenotypic plasticity therefore confers a selective
   advantage by extending the temporal and spatial extent of the animals'
   fundamental niche.

AB The packaging of DNA into proper chromatin structure contributes to
   transcriptional regulation. This packaging is environment sensitive, yet
   its role in adaptation to novel environmental conditions is completely
   unknown. We set out to identify candidate chromatin-remodeling loci that
   are differentiated between tropical and temperate populations in
   Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally equatorial African species that
   has recently colonized temperate environments around the world. Here we
   describe sequence variation at seven such chromatin-remodeling loci,
   four of which(chd1, ssrp, chm, and glu) exhibit strong differentiation
   between tropical and temperate populations. An in-depth analysis of chm
   revealed sequence differentiation restricted to a small portion of the
   gene, as well as evidence of clinal variation along the east coasts of
   both the United States and Australia. The functions of chd1, chm, ssrp,
   and glu point to several novel hypotheses for the role of
   chromatin-based transcriptional regulation in adaptation to a novel
   environment. Specifically, both stress-induced transcription and
   developmental homeostasis emerge as potential functional targets of
   environment-dependent selection.

   (Globigerinoides ruber pink sensu stricto) data and sea-surface
   temperatures (SSTs) derived from artificial neural network (ANN)
   transfer functions, a reconstruction was made of upper water mass
   variability in the Anegada-Jungfern Passage (AJP), northeastern
   Caribbean Sea, over the last c. 11,100 years. Our record is based on the
   study of two marine sediment cores and reveals three main circulation
   stages during the Holocene. In the early-Holocene (11,100-6300 cal. yr
   BP), ANN-based SST estimations indicate moderately cooler than present
   winter condition in the NE Caribbean with SSTs of similar to 25.5
   degrees C. These conditions presumably reflect advection of well-mixed
   upper water masses from the Guyana upwelling area associated with a
   strong Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and enhanced
   trade wind activity, linked to a more northerly location of the
   inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Between 6300 and 3700 cal. yr
   BP, a relative warming of winter SSTs (similar to 26.5 degrees C) was
   probably related to a weaker circulation and upper water mass mixing
   because of less intense trade wind activity, as the ITCZ moved
   southwards. From 3700 cal. yr BP to the present, the region was
   characterised by small seasonal SST variations and generally stable
   winter and summer SSTs. The data suggest a minor shift in the (sub)
   surface inflow pattern during the last 2000 years, possibly related to
   changes in Northern Hemisphere large-scale atmospheric circulation also
   observed at higher latitude. The ANN-based temperature pattern is
   supported by fluctuations in the Mg/Ca-derived temperature record,
   although temperature maxima derived from the Mg/Ca ratio appear
   anomalously high. On a Holocene timescale, we conclude that the
   northeastern Caribbean SST and circulation regime have been mainly
   dependent on the position of the ITCZ, which, in turn, is controlled by
   changes in hemispheric solar insolation.

AB Gas exchange measurements were carried out on ash and oak trees in a
   forest plantation during three whole growing seasons characterized by
   different water availability (2001, 2002 and 2003). A quantitative
   limitation analysis was applied to estimate the effects of drought and
   leaf ontogeny on stomatal (S-L) and non-stomatal limitations (NSL) to
   light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)), relative to the seasonal
   maximum rates obtained under conditions of optimal soil water content.
   Furthermore, based on combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence
   measurements, NSL was partitioned into a diffusive (due to a decrease in
   mesophyll conductance, MCL) and a biochemical component (due to a
   decrease in carboxylation capacity, B-L). During the wettest year
   (2002), the seasonal pattern of both A(max) and stomatal conductance
   (g(sw)) was characterized in both species by a rapid increase during
   spring and a slight decline over the summer. However, with a moderate
   (year 2001) or a severe (year 2003) water stress, the summer decline of
   A(max) and g(sw) was more pronounced and increased with drought
   intensity (30-40% in 2001, 60-75% in 2003). The limitation analysis
   showed that during the spring and the autumn periods S-L, MCL and B-L
   were of similar magnitude. By contrast, from the summer data it emerged
   that all the limitations increased with drought intensity, but their
   relative contribution changed. At mild to moderate water stress
   (corresponding to values of g(sw) > 100 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)) about
   two-thirds of the decline in A(max) was attributable to S-L. However,
   with increasing drought intensity, NSL increased more than S-L and
   nearly equalled it when the stress was very severe (i.e. with g(sw) < 60
   mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)). Within NSL, MCL represented the main component,
   except at the most severe water stress levels when it was equalled by
   B-L. It is concluded that diffusional limitations (i.e. S-L + MCL)
   largely affect net assimilation during most of the year, whereas
   biochemical limitations are quantitatively important only during leaf
   development and senescence or with severe droughts.

AB Robust ecological forecasting requires accurate predictions of
   physiological responses to environmental drivers. Energy budget models
   facilitate this by mechanistically linking biology to abiotic drivers,
   but are usually ground-truthed under relatively stable physical
   conditions, omitting temporal/spatial environmental variability. Dynamic
   Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a powerful framework capable of linking
   individual fitness to environmental drivers and we tested its ability to
   accommodate variability by examining model predictions across the rocky
   shore, a steep ecotone characterized by wide fluctuations in temperature
   and food availability. We parameterized DEB models for co-existing
   mid/high-shore (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and mid/low-shore (Perna
   perna) mussels on the south coast of South Africa. First, we assumed
   permanently submerged conditions, and then incorporated metabolic
   depression under low tide conditions, using detailed data of tidal
   cycles, body temperature and variability in food over 12 months at three
   sites. Models provided good estimates of shell length for both species
   across the shore, but predictions of gonadosomatic index were
   consistently lower than observed. Model disagreement could reflect the
   effects of details of biology and/or difficulties in capturing
   environmental variability, emphasising the need to incorporate both. Our
   approach provides guidelines for incorporating environmental variability
   and long-term change into mechanistic models to improve ecological
   predictions.

AB Population dynamics of herbivorous insects are strongly influenced by
   temperature and host plant quality; an interaction generally thought to
   be mediated via effects of temperature on metabolic rate and altered
   energy requirements. However, recent research suggests the relationship
   between nutrition, temperature, host plant quality and life history
   traits that influence insect fitness are more complex than appreciated
   to date. In the laboratory, rates of development are most strongly
   influenced by temperature, while growth, body composition, and
   reproductive output are greatly affected by nutrition, notably the
   uptake of protein and carbohydrate. However, individual outcomes and
   consequently population responses in the field are not readily predicted
   from data on ambient temperatures and host plant chemical composition.
   The relative amounts of protein and carbohydrate gained from a host
   plant depends on complex interactions between plant cell structure and
   leaf chemistry, combined with plasticity in feeding behaviour,
   microclimate selection, digestive and assimilative physiology. For
   example, grasshoppers can exploit the temperature dependence of host
   plant quality to maintain nutritional homeostasis. Consequently,
   understanding environmental interactions such as leaf defences and
   patterns of foraging, and predicting the effects of climate change on
   insect populations, will be complex.

AB Anthropogenic warming may change precipitation patterns, impacting
   infrastructure performance and reliability. Future precipitation
   statistics generated using General Circulation Models (GCM) are,
   however, often biased and not easily applied to problems such as runoff
   estimation. Stochastic weather generation is hence used as an
   alternative to GCMs in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper
   explores the dependence of fine temporal precipitation characteristics
   on air pressure and air temperature using historic observations. The
   goal is to develop, based on the key causes of precipitation, a
   climatological basis for a stochastic precipitation generator for
   non-stationary precipitation under climate change conditions. The
   analysis focuses on precipitation in the urban Northeast United States
   and utilizes pooled observations from meteorological stations in New
   York City, Philadelphia, and Boston over 60 years. A negative
   correlation between hourly Probability of Precipitation (POP) and air
   pressure is observed. When the historical records are discretized using
   air Pressure Change Events (PCE), Decreasing Pressure Change Events
   (DePCEs) had a higher POP and a higher Precipitation Depth (PD) than
   Increasing Pressure Change Events (InPCEs). Temperature was more
   strongly associated with PD during DePCEs than InPCEs; this association
   was more pronounced during high magnitude PCEs and extreme events. The
   potential for simulating future hourly precipitation by associating
   historic hourly precipitation patterns with PCE's and monthly
   temperature is assessed.

   two cold spells, at 17 ka and 15.8 ka, (iii) the climatic oscillation
   during the GI-1 event, and (iv) the development of the Younger Dryas
   (GS-1) event in two phases. During the Holocene epoch, five brief cold
   and/or arid phases occurred, at around 10.5 ka, 8.2 ka, 7 ka to 6 ka,
   5.0 ka and 3.0 ka. The most warm and humid Holocene events correspond to
   the time of the deposition of the two sapropel sublayers: S1a and S1b.
   Almost all of these brief climatic changes are coeval with equivalent
   changes in high northern latitude areas and with changes in the
   intensity of the Siberian High, suggesting a climatic link between the
   studied area and the high-latitude areas. The prevalence of Holocene
   arid events, which coincide with equivalent events recorded in
   North-Eastern Africa and the Middle East, suggests a climatic link
   between the eastern and south-eastern regions of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including
   extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and
   propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell
   damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and
   surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and
   dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on Picea
   abies growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing
   patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin
   branches toward the main stem's top and base, and (3) from the base
   toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from
   their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and
   heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation.
   This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions
   upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of
   freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water
   fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated
   cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to
   minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit
   and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common
   mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter
   tree physiology.

AB To realistically understand spatial and temporal variations in the net
   ecosystem production (NEP) of rice paddies in Japan, we enhanced the
   existing diagnostic-type biosphere model with the addition of
   agricultural processes. Validated with a comparison of seasonal and
   annual variations over 5 years, the NEP estimations bore good agreement
   with the measurements. In regional-scale analyses, we targeted all rice
   paddy fields in Japan from January 2001 to December 2009. Before and
   after the model enhancement, the NEP showed very different spatial
   variations and absolute values, suggesting that the most effective
   improvements were the introduction of harvest and soil
   oxidation-reduction processes. In annual anomaly analyses covering a
   9-year period, the NEP was found to be negative in 2003 and 2006 (-0.11
   and -0.25 TgC/year) and positive in 2004 and 2007 (+0.02 and +0.21
   TgC/year). We found that the negative values were caused by decreases in
   solar radiation and air temperature and the positive values were caused
   by increases in these two parameters and precipitation. In response to
   the NEP, our obtained harvested grain biomass values in 2003 and 2006
   were lower than usual. The results were in good agreement with the
   results from reports of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Ministry
   of Agriculture. Forestry, and Fisheries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB For tsetse (Glossina spp.), the vectors of human and animal
   trypanosomiases, the physiological mechanisms linking variation in
   population dynamics with changing weather conditions have not been well
   established. Here, we investigate high- and low-temperature tolerance in
   terms of activity limits and survival in a natural population of adult
   Glossina pallidipes from eastern Zambia. Due to increased interest in
   chilling flies for handling and aerial dispersal in sterile insect
   technique control and eradication programmes, we also provide further
   detailed investigation of low-temperature responses. In wild-caught G.
   pallidipes, the probability of survival for 50% of the population at
   low-temperatures was at 3.7, 8.9 and 9.6 degrees C (95% CIs: +/- 1.5
   degrees C) for 1, 2 and 3 h treatments, respectively. At high
   temperatures, it was estimated that treatments at 37.9, 36.2 and 35.6
   degrees C (95% CIs: +0.5 degrees C) would yield 50% population survival
   for 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively. Significant effects of time and
   temperature were detected at both temperature extremes (GLZ, p < 0.05 in
   all cases) although a time-temperature interaction was only detected at
   high temperatures (p < 0.0001). We synthesized data from four other
   Kenyan populations and found that upper critical thermal limits showed
   little variation among populations and laboratory treatments (range:
   43.9-45.0 degrees C 0.25 degrees C/min heating rate), although reduction
   to more ecologically relevant heating rates (0.06 degrees C/min) reduce
   these values significantly from similar to 44.4 to 40.6 degrees C,
   thereby providing a causal explanation for why tsetse distribution may
   be high-temperature limited. By contrast, low-temperature limits showed
   substantial variation among populations and acclimation treatments
   (range: 4.5-13.8 degrees C; 0.25 degrees C/min), indicating high levels
   of inter-population variability. Ecologically relevant cooling rates
   (0.06 degrees C/min) suggest tsetses are likely to experience chill coma
   temperatures under natural conditions (-20-21 degrees C). The results
   from acute hardening experiments in the Zambian population demonstrate
   limited ability to improve low-temperature tolerance over short (hourly)
   timescales after non-lethal pre-treatments. In flies which survived
   chilling, recovery times were non-linear with plateaus between 2-6 and
   8-12 degrees C. Survival times ranged between 4 and 36 h and did not
   vary between flies which had undergone chill coma by comparison with
   flies which had not, even after factoring body condition into the
   analyses (p > 0.5 in all cases). However, flies with low chill coma
   values had the highest body water and fat content, indicating that when
   energy reserves are depleted, low-temperature tolerance may be
   compromised. Overall, these results suggest that physiological
   mechanisms may provide insight into tsetse population dynamics, hence
   distribution and abundance, and support a general prediction for reduced
   geographic distribution under future climate warming scenarios. (c) 2007

AB Food webs in high-latitude oceans are dominated by relatively few
   species. Future ocean and sea-ice changes affecting the distribution of
   such species will impact the structure and functioning of whole
   ecosystems. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in
   Southern Ocean food webs, but there is little understanding of the
   factors influencing its success throughout much of the ocean. The
   capacity of a habitat to maintain growth will be crucial and here we use
   an empirical relationship of growth rate to assess seasonal spatial
   variability. Over much of the ocean, potential for growth is limited,
   with three restricted oceanic regions where seasonal conditions permit
   high growth rates, and only a few areas around the Scotia Sea and
   Antarctic Peninsula suitable for growth of the largest krill (> 60 mm).
   Our study demonstrates that projections of impacts of future change need
   to account for spatial and seasonal variability of key ecological
   processes within ocean ecosystems.

AB Replicated lines of Drosophila subobscura originating from a large
   outbred stock collected at the estimated Chilean epicentre (Puerto
   Montt) of the original New World invasion were allowed to evolve under
   controlled conditions of larval crowding for 3.5 years at three
   temperature levels (13, 18 and 22 degrees C). Several pre-adult life
   history traits (development time, survival and competitive ability),
   adult life history related traits (wing size, wing shape and wing-aspect
   ratio), and wing size and shape asymmetries were measured at the three
   temperatures. Cold-adapted (13 degrees C) populations evolved longer
   development times and showed lower survival at the highest developmental
   temperature. No divergence for wing size was detected following
   adaptation to temperature extremes (13 and 22 degrees C), in agreement
   with earlier observations, but wing shape changes were obvious as a
   result of both thermal adaptation and development at different
   temperatures. However, the evolutionary trends observed for the
   wing-aspect ratio were inconsistent with an adaptive hypothesis. There
   was some indication that wing shape asymmetry has evolutionarily
   increased in warm-adapted populations, which suggests that there is
   additive genetic variation for fluctuating asymmetry and that it can
   evolve under rapid environmental changes caused by thermal stress.
   Overall, our results cast strong doubts on the hypothesis that body size
   itself is the target of selection, and suggest that pre-adult life
   history traits are more closely related to thermal adaptation.

AB This paper proposes a method to estimate a woman's menstrual cycle based
   on the hidden Markov model (HMM). A tiny device was developed that
   attaches around the abdominal region to measure cutaneous temperature at
   10-min intervals during sleep. The measured temperature data were
   encoded as a two-dimensional image (QR code, i.e., quick response code)
   and displayed in the LCD window of the device. A mobile phone captured
   the QR code image, decoded the information and transmitted the data to a
   database server. The collected data were analyzed by three steps to
   estimate the biphasic temperature property in a menstrual cycle. The key
   step was an HMM-based step between preprocessing and postprocessing. A
   discrete Markov model, with two hidden phases, was assumed to represent
   higher- and lower-temperature phases during a menstrual cycle. The
   proposed method was verified by the data collected from 30 female
   participants, aged from 14 to 46, over six consecutive months. By
   comparing the estimated results with individual records from the
   participants, 71.6% of 190 menstrual cycles were correctly estimated.
   The sensitivity and positive predictability were 91.8 and 96.6%,
   respectively. This objective evaluation provides a promising approach
   for managing premenstrual syndrome and birth control.

   because of world population growth but also as a result of escalating
   demand for crops as a substrate for biofuels. The production of improved
   plant varieties, especially major crops such as rice, is urgently
   required to increase yield. The completion of the sequencing of the rice
   genome has made it possible to clone and analyze quantitative trait loci
   (QTLs). Furthermore, the development of high-throughput sequencing and
   genotyping technologies has improved spectacularly the accuracy of QTL
   analysis. In this review article, we focus on the potential roles of
   major QTLs in the selection for agronomic traits in rice and discuss the

AB Colonies of social insects display an amazing degree of flexibility in
   dealing with long-term and short-term perturbations in their
   environment. The key organizational element of insect societies is
   division of labor. Recent literature suggests that interindividual
   variability in response thresholds plays an important role in the
   emergence of division of labor among workers (reviewed in [1, 2]).
   Genetic variation can only partly explain the variability among workers.
   Here we document the effects of both preimaginal and adult thermal
   experience on the behavioral differentiation of Camponotus rufipes ant
   workers. We show that preimaginal temperature (22 degrees C or 32
   degrees C during pupal stage) affects temperature-response thresholds
   and temperature preferences of adult brood-tending workers. We further
   show that brood-carrying experience gathered as adult during several
   repeated temperature increases modifies thermal behavior. Experienced
   workers showed a faster transition from first sensing the temperature
   stimulus to responding with brood translocation. Developmental
   plasticity of workers provides a colony with flexibility in dealing with
   thermal variations and constitutes an important mechanism underlying
   interindividual variability. Adult thermal experience further fine tunes
   the behavioral response thresholds and reinforces behavioral
   differentiation among workers.

AB Populations at risk of extinction due to climate change may be rescued
   by adaptive evolution or plasticity. Selective agents, such as
   introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive
   responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature
   by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in
   the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We
   subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms
   over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden
   experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history
   traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits,
   suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations
   enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high
   temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature
   increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was
   higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater
   plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither
   body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection.
   These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of
   the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within
   populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to
   selection by temperature.

AB Razor clam species are commercially important worldwide. In Tunisia,
   studies on razor clams aim to promote harvesting and ensure a rational
   and durable exploitation. In Tunisia, Solen marginatus (Pulteney, 1799)
   is the most abundant razor clam species although Ensis species,
   particularly Ensis minor, are also found. The aim of this study is to
   understand the allocation strategies of S. marginatus in terms of growth
   and reproduction. For that, condition indices and histological analysis
   were performed and related to temperature and chlorophyll a. Clams were
   collected monthly in the southern Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Gabes,
   Tunisia). Body and somatic mass increased in summer and autumn. Body
   condition was highest in September 2007 and the highest somatic
   condition index was measured in August 2008. Body and somatic mass loss
   occurred in winter and late spring-early summer with lowest values
   found, respectively, in February and May 2008. Gametogenesis rate was
   slow and held in a synchronous way during the cold season, leading to
   massive spawning and exhaustion in July 2008, and probably in June 2007.
   The abundant food conditions and elevated temperatures during the summer
   initiated a new gametogenic cycle and partial spawning events were
   observed in autumn 2007, after which high restoration activity occurred.
   The species seems to have adopted two reproductive strategies: a
   conservative strategy during the cold season, when food is scarce, and
   an opportunistic strategy during summer and autumn, when food is
   abundant and temperatures are high.

AB Food restriction (FR) retards animals' growth. Understanding the
   underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon is important to conceptual
   problems in life-history theory, as well as to applied problems in
   animal husbandry and biomedicine. Despite a considerable amount of
   empirical data published since the 1930s, there is no relevant general
   theoretical framework that predicts how animals vary their energy
   budgets and life-history traits under FR. In this paper, we develop such
   a general quantitative model based on fundamental principles of
   metabolic energy allocation during ontogeny. This model predicts growth
   curves under varying conditions of FR, such as the compensatory growth,
   different age at which FR begins, its degree and its duration. Our model
   gives a quantitative explanation for the counter-intuitive phenomenon
   that under FR, lower body temperature and lower metabolism lead to
   faster growth and larger adult size. This model also predicts that the
   animals experiencing FR reach the same fraction of their adult mass at
   the same age as their ad libitum counterparts. All predictions are well
   supported by empirical data from mammals and birds of varying body size,
   under different conditions of FR.

AB Variation of ecophysiological traits may help to explain geographic
   distribution patterns of Drosophila sibling species. Many traits in
   ectotherms have optimal performance within specific temperature ranges.
   Altitudinal gradients are potentially informative for characterizing
   differences of sibling species distributions. We collected two sibling
   species of the tripunctata group - Drosophila mediopunctata (MPT) and D.
   unipunctata (UNI) - at eight altitudes (ranging from 593 to 1185 m above
   sea level) located at a continuous Atlantic Rainforest reserve in
   consecutive years (2009-2011), with two collections at the hot-rainy
   season and two at the cold-dry season. Mean altitude was significantly
   different between species and seasons. Their distributions showed a
   consistent pattern with MPT always occurring at higher altitudes than
   UNI. A significant correlation was found between altitude and species
   relative abundance. We characterized the thermal range of fertility, an
   important fitness component, for each species and found evidence for
   differential thermal adaptation. Our results suggest that the two
   species altitudinal distributions and seasonal relative abundances are
   consistent with their differential thermal adaptations: MPT seems to be
   adapted to lower temperatures, occupies higher altitudes and occurs at
   higher relative abundances in the cold-dry season; while UNI tolerates
   higher temperatures and occurs at lower altitudes and higher relative
   abundances in the hot-rainy season. However, their thermal ranges
   overlap at most temperatures, suggesting that additional variables (e.g.
   habitat choice, competition, differential survival etc.) may also play a
   role to determine their distribution in the field.

AB The responses of organisms to temperature variations may be via short
   term responses of the phenotype (phenotypic plasticity), or they could
   involve long-term evolutionary change and adaptation (via selection) to
   the genotype. These could involve changes to the mean size of the animal
   or to the thermal reaction norm. We examined the effects of various
   temperatures (of 22, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C) on development time,
   adult body size and preadult survivorship in three populations of the
   cockroach, Eupolyphaga sinensis (Walker), collected at different
   latitudes. We found substantial temperature-induced plasticity in
   development time, body size, and preadult survivorship, indicating that
   developmental temperatures have strong impacts on growth and life
   history traits of E. sinensis. Genetic differences for development time,
   body size, and preadult survivorship were detected among populations,
   and the three traits exhibited highly significant variations in the
   responses of different populations to various temperature conditions,
   indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal
   reaction norms. We also found that two populations seem to support the
   beneficial acclimation hypothesis whereas the third mid-latitude
   population does not. The results are likely because of differences in
   season length and voltinism, indicating that not only temperature regime
   but also its interactions with generation time (and development time),
   voltinism, and season length are likely to have considerable effects on
   insect development time and body size. Overall, changes in development
   time, body size, and preadult survivorship in E. sinensis can all be
   regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes.

AB Influenza incidence and seasonality, along with virus survival and
   transmission, appear to depend at least partly on humidity, and recent
   studies have suggested that absolute humidity (AH) is more important
   than relative humidity (RH) in modulating observed patterns. In this
   perspective article, we re-evaluate studies of influenza virus survival
   in aerosols, transmission in animal models and influenza incidence to
   show that the combination of temperature and RH is equally valid as AH
   as a predictor. Collinearity must be considered, as higher levels of AH
   are only possible at higher temperatures, where it is well established
   that virus decay is more rapid. In studies of incidence that employ
   meteorological data, outdoor AH may be serving as a proxy for indoor RH
   in temperate regions during the wintertime heating season. Finally, we
   present a mechanistic explanation based on droplet evaporation and its
   impact on droplet physics and chemistry for why RH is more likely than
   AH to modulate virus survival and transmission.

AB Mysids play an essential role as the dominant prey species for coastal
   fishes. In Japan, the mysid Neomysis awatschensis (Brandt, 1851) is
   commonly distributed in estuarine and shallow coastal waters with high
   productivity due to supply of nutrients from the watershed. The present
   study investigates the distribution and life history of the mysid N.
   awatschensis in relation to biotic and abiotic factors by monthly
   sampling from March 2014 to July 2015 at stations along the Yura River
   estuary, the central Sea of Japan.
   The Yura River physical conditions change seasonally and are affected by
   its discharge. Salt-wedge intrusions were frequently observed and found
   up to 18 km from the river mouth from April to December 2014 when river
   discharge was low, whereas in 2015 intrusions were less pronounced,
   possibly due to river mouth clogging. Clear seasonality was observed in
   mysid density, showing highest densities (up to 202 inds/m2) in spring
   and early summer in contrast with lowest densities (<16 inds/m2) from
   late summer to winter. Neomysis awatschensis appeared to change its
   reproduction characteristics in response to changes in the environment,
   large-sized females occurred in spring to produce large numbers of eggs
   and larvae during the high primary production period. In late summer,
   the population declined due to increasing mortality of juveniles at high
   temperatures. In autumn and winter, high river discharge and low
   temperature suppressed reproduction and survival in the mysid
   population. It is notable that N. awatschensis occurred within a
   salinity range of 0-32 and no clear influence of salinity on the mysid
   density was found.
   Those results suggest that reproduction is partially suppressed by
   variable and oligotrophic conditions in the Yura River estuary. Combined
   with the flexibility to seasonal changes in temperature and food
   availability, the great tolerance to acute salinity fluctuations allows
   N. awatschensis to maintain its population in the estuary. (C) 2017

AB Many organisms adjust their reproductive phenology in response to
   climate change, but phenological sensitivity to temperature may vary
   between species. For example, resident and migratory birds have vastly
   different annual cycles, which can cause differential temperature
   sensitivity at the breeding grounds, and may affect competitive
   dynamics. Currently, however, adjustment to climate change in resident
   and migratory birds have been studied separately or at relatively small
   geographical scales with varying time series durations and
   methodologies. Here, we studied differential effects of temperature on
   resident and migratory birds using the mean egg laying initiation dates
   from 10 European nest box schemes between 1991 and 2015 that had data on
   at least one resident tit species and at least one migratory flycatcher
   species. We found that both tits and flycatchers advanced laying in
   response to spring warming, but resident tit populations advanced more
   strongly in relation to temperature increases than migratory
   flycatchers. These different temperature responses have already led to a
   divergence in laying dates between tits and flycatchers of on average
   0.94days per decade over the current study period. Interestingly, this
   divergence was stronger at lower latitudes where the interval between
   tit and flycatcher phenology is smaller and winter conditions can be
   considered more favorable for resident birds. This could indicate that
   phenological adjustment to climate change by flycatchers is increasingly
   hampered by competition with resident species. Indeed, we found that tit
   laying date had an additional effect on flycatcher laying date after
   controlling for temperature, and this effect was strongest in areas with
   the shortest interval between both species groups. Combined, our results
   suggest that the differential effect of climate change on species groups
   with overlapping breeding ecology affects the phenological interval
   between them, potentially affecting interspecific interactions.

AB Maintenance of thermal homeostasis in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) is
   associated with changes in their thermal balance. The thermodynamic
   relationship between heat dissipation and energy storage is altered by
   the ingestion of high-energy diet content. Observation of thermal
   registers of core temperature behavior, in humans and rodents, permits
   identification of some characteristics of time series, such as
   autoreference and stationarity that fit adequately to a stochastic
   analysis. To identify this change, we used, for the first time, a
   stochastic autoregressive model, the concepts of which match those
   associated with physiological systems involved and applied in male HFD
   rats compared with their appropriate standard food intake age-matched
   male controls (n = 7 per group). By analyzing a recorded temperature
   time series, we were able to identify when thermal homeostasis would be
   affected by a new diet. The autoregressive time series model (AR model)
   was used to predict the occurrence of thermal homeostasis, and this
   model proved to be very effective in distinguishing such a physiological
   disorder. Thus, we infer from the results of our study that maximum
   entropy distribution as a means for stochastic characterization of
   temperature time series registers may be established as an important and
   early tool to aid in the diagnosis and prevention of metabolic diseases
   due to their ability to detect small variations in thermal profile.

AB Most investigations of insect gas exchange patterns and the hypotheses
   proposed to account for their evolution have been based either on
   small-scale, manipulative experiments, or comparisons of a few closely
   related species. Despite their potential utility, no explicit,
   phylogeny-based, broad-scale comparative studies of the evolution of gas
   exchange in insects have been undertaken. This may be due partly to the
   preponderance of information for the endopterygotes, and its scarcity
   for the apterygotes and exopterygotes. Here we undertake such a
   broad-scale study. Information on gas exchange patterns for the large
   majority of insects examined to date (eight orders, 99 species) is
   compiled, and new information on 19 exemplar species from a further ten
   orders, not previously represented in the literature (Archaeognatha,
   Zygentoma, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Mantodea, Mantophasmatodea,
   Phasmatodea, Dermaptera, Neuroptera, Trichoptera), is provided. These
   data are then used in a formal, phylogeny-based parsimony analysis of
   the evolution of gas exchange patterns at the order level. Cyclic gas
   exchange is likely to be the ancestral gas exchange pattern at rest
   (recognizing that active individuals typically show continuous gas
   exchange), and discontinuous gas exchange probably originated
   independently a minimum of five times in the Insecta.

AB Sites that display strong environmental contrasts in close proximity,

   for investigating adaptive evolution in action. We reared Drosophila
   melanogaster from collection sites along altitudinal transects on the
   north- and south-facing canyon slopes in each of three temperature
   environments, and assessed genetic variation in ovariole number and body
   size between and within collection sites, and temperature plasticity.
   Both traits exhibited significant genetic variation within collection
   sites and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, but not
   genetic variation for plasticity. Between-site genetic variation in
   ovariole number was negatively correlated with altitude on both slopes
   of the canyon, and collections from the north- and south-facing slopes
   were genetically differentiated for male, but not female, body size.
   Genetic variation between sites within easy dispersal range is
   consistent with the action of strong natural selection, although neither
   the selective agent(s) nor the direct targets of selection are known.

AB Caenorhabditis elegans uses chemosensation to determine its course of
   development. Young larvae can arrest as dauer larvae in response to
   increasing population density, which they measure by a nematode-excreted
   pheromone, and decreasing food supply. Dauer larvae can resume
   development in response to a decrease in pheromone and increase in food
   concentration. We show here that two novel G protein alpha subunits
   (GPA-2 and GPA-3) show promoter activity in subsets of chemosensory
   neurons and are involved in the decision to form dauer larvae primarily
   through the response to dauer pheromone. Dominant activating mutations
   in these G proteins result in constitutive, pheromone-independent dauer
   formation, whereas inactivation results in reduced sensitivity to
   pheromone, and, under certain conditions, an alteration in the response
   to food. Interactions between gpa-2, gpa-3 and other genes controlling
   dauer formation suggest that these G proteins may act in parallel to
   regulate the neuronal decision making that precedes dauer formation.

AB Climate data created from historic climate observations are integral to
   most assessments of potential climate change impacts, and frequently
   comprise the baseline period used to infer species-climate
   relationships. They are often also central to downscaling coarse
   resolution climate simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to
   project future climate scenarios at ecologically relevant spatial
   scales. Uncertainty in these baseline data can be large, particularly
   where weather observations are sparse and climate dynamics are complex
   (e.g. over mountainous or coastal regions). Yet, importantly, this
   uncertainty is almost universally overlooked when assessing potential
   responses of species to climate change. Here, we assessed the importance
   of historic baseline climate uncertainty for projections of species'
   responses to future climate change. We built species distribution models
   (SDMs) for 895 African bird species of conservation concern, using six
   different climate baselines. We projected these models to two future
   periods (2040-2069, 2070-2099), using downscaled climate projections,
   and calculated species turnover and changes in species-specific climate
   suitability. We found that the choice of baseline climate data
   constituted an important source of uncertainty in projections of both
   species turnover and species-specific climate suitability, often
   comparable with, or more important than, uncertainty arising from the
   choice of GCM. Importantly, the relative contribution of these factors
   to projection uncertainty varied spatially. Moreover, when projecting
   SDMs to sites of biodiversity importance (Important Bird and
   Biodiversity Areas), these uncertainties altered site-level impacts,
   which could affect conservation prioritization. Our results highlight
   that projections of species' responses to climate change are sensitive
   to uncertainty in the baseline climatology. We recommend that this
   should be considered routinely in such analyses.

AB The fruit is a hierarchically organized organ composed of cells from
   different tissues. Its quality, defined by traits such as fruit size and
   composition, is the result of a complex chain of biological processes.
   These processes involve exchanges (transpiration, respiration,
   photosynthesis, phloem and xylem fluxes, and ethylene emission) between
   the fruit and its environment (atmosphere or plant), tissue
   differentiation, and cell functioning (division, endoreduplication,
   expansion, metabolic transformations, and vacuolar storage). In order to
   progress in our understanding of quality development, it is necessary to
   analyse the fruit as a system, in which processes interact. In this
   case, a process-based modelling approach is particularly powerful. Such
   a modelling approach is proposed to develop a future 'virtual fruit'
   model. The value of a virtual fruit for agronomists and geneticists is
   also discussed.

AB Anthropogenic impairment of water bodies represents a global
   environmental concern, yet few attempts have successfully linked fish
   performance to thermal habitat suitability and fewer have distinguished
   co-varying water quality constraints. We interfaced fish bioenergetics,
   field measurements, and Thermal Remote Imaging to generate a
   spatially-explicit, high-resolution surface of fish growth potential,
   and next employed a structured hypothesis to detect relationships among
   measures of fish performance and co-varying water quality constraints.
   Our thermal surface of fish performance captured the amount and
   spatial-temporal arrangement of thermally-suitable habitat for three
   focal species in an extremely heterogeneous reservoir, but
   interpretation of this pattern was initially confounded by seasonal
   covariation of water residence time and water quality. Subsequent path
   analysis revealed that in terms of seasonal patterns in growth
   potential, catfish and walleye responded to temperature, positively and
   negatively, respectively; crappie and walleye responded to eutrophy
   (negatively). At the high eutrophy levels observed in this system, some
   desired fishes appear to suffer from excessive cultural eutrophication
   within the context of elevated temperatures whereas others appear to be
   largely unaffected or even enhanced. Our overall findings do not lead to
   the conclusion that this system is degraded by pollution; however, they
   do highlight the need to use a sensitive focal species in the process of
   determining allowable nutrient loading and as integrators of habitat
   suitability across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We provide an
   integrated approach useful for quantifying fish growth potential and
   identifying water quality constraints on fish performance at spatial
   scales appropriate for whole-system management.

AB Organisms can respond to variation in temperature through the direct
   effect of temperature on phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity), or through
   long-term adaptation to temperature (and thus evolution of either mean
   size or thermal reaction norm). We examined the effects of various
   temperatures (of 20 and 30 degrees C) on development time, adult body
   size (body length and body width) and pre-adult survivorship in six
   populations of Chrysomya megacephala, collected at different latitudes.
   We found that temperature changes induced substantial plasticity in
   terms of development time, body size and pre-adult survivorship.
   indicating that developmental temperature significantly affects growth
   and life history traits of C. megacephala. We also detected genetic
   differences among populations for body size and development time, and
   these two traits exhibited highly significant variations in the
   responses of different populations to various temperature conditions,
   indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal
   reaction norms. The latitude of origin of the different populations (and
   hence mean temperature regimes in the environments from where the
   populations originated) did not appear to fully explain these genetic
   differences. In short, changes in development time and body size in C.
   megacephala can be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes.

   spectrometry, revealed a high variability of (13)Delta, both on diurnal
   and day-to-day timescales. We tested the prediction capability of three
   versions of a commonly used model for (13)Delta [called here
   comprehensive ((13)Delta(comp)), simplified ((13)Delta(simple)) and
   revised ((13)Delta(revised)) versions]. A Bayesian approach was used to
   calibrate major model parameters. Constrained estimates were found for
   the fractionation during CO2 fixation in (13)Delta(comp), but not in
   (13)Delta(simple), and partially for the mesophyll conductance for CO2
   (g(i)). No constrained estimates were found for fractionations during
   mitochondrial and photorespiration, and for a diurnally variable
   apparent fractionation between current assimilates and mitochondrial
   respiration, specific to (13)Delta(revised). A quantification of
   parameter estimation uncertainties and interdependencies further helped
   explore model structure and behaviour. We found that (13)Delta(comp)
   usually outperformed (13)Delta(simple) because of the explicit
   consideration of g(i) and the photorespiratory fractionation in
   (13)Delta(comp) that enabled a better description of the large observed
   diurnal variation (approximate to 9 parts per thousand) of (13)Delta.
   Flux-weighted daily means of (13)Delta were also better predicted with
   (13)Delta(comp) than with (13)Delta(simple).

AB Sexual selection can increase rates of adaptation by imposing strong
   selection in males, thereby allowing efficient purging of the mutation
   load on population fitness at a low demographic cost. Indeed, sexual
   selection tends to be male-biased throughout the animal kingdom, but
   little empirical work has explored the ecological sensitivity of this
   sex difference. In this study, we generated theoretical predictions of
   sex-specific strengths of selection, environmental sensitivities and
   genotype-by-environment interactions and tested them in seed beetles by
   manipulating either larval host plant or rearing temperature. Using
   fourteen isofemale lines, we measured sex-specific reductions in fitness
   components, genotype-by-environment interactions and the strength of
   selection (variance in fitness) in the juvenile and adult stage. As
   predicted, variance in fitness increased with stress, was consistently
   greater in males than females for adult reproductive success (implying
   strong sexual selection), but was similar in the sexes in terms of
   juvenile survival across all levels of stress. Although genetic variance
   in fitness increased in magnitude under severe stress, heritability
   decreased and particularly so in males. Moreover,
   genotype-by-environment interactions for fitness were common but
   specific to the type of stress, sex and life stage, suggesting that new
   environments may change the relative alignment and strength of selection
   in males and females. Our study thus exemplifies how environmental
   stress can influence the relative forces of natural and sexual
   selection, as well as concomitant changes in genetic variance in
   fitness, which are predicted to have consequences for rates of
   adaptation in sexual populations.

AB Hemoglobin (Hb) polymorphism in cod is associated with
   temperature-related differences in biogeographical distribution, and
   several authors have suggested that functional characteristics of the
   various hemoglobin isoforms (HbIs) directly influence phenotypic traits
   such as growth rate. However, no study has directly examined whether Hb
   genotype translates into physiological differences at the whole animal
   level. Thus, we generated a family of juvenile Atlantic cod consisting
   of all three main Hb genotypes (HbI-1/1, HbI-2/2, and HbI-1/2) by
   crossing a single pair of heterozygous parents, and we compared their
   metabolic and cortisol responses to an acute thermal challenge (10
   degrees C to their critical thermal maximum [CTM] or 22 degrees C,
   respectively) and tolerance of graded hypoxia. There were no differences
   in routine metabolism (at 10 degrees C), maximum metabolic rate,
   metabolic scope, CTM (overall mean 22.9 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C), or
   resting and poststress plasma cortisol levels among Hb genotypes.
   Further, although the HbI-1/1 fish grew more (by 15%-30% during the
   first 9 mo) when reared at 10 degrees +/- 1 degrees C and had a slightly
   enhanced hypoxia tolerance at 10 degrees C (e. g., 1 degrees C the
   critical O-2 levels for HbI-1/1, HbI-2/2, and HbI-1/2 cod were and
   35.56% +/- 1.24%, 40.56% +/- 1.99%, 40.20% +/- 1.19% air saturation,
   respectively), these results are contradictory to expectations based on
   HbI functional properties. Thus, our findings (1) do not support
   previous assumptions that growth rate differences among cod Hb genotypes
   result from a more efficient use of the oxygen supply-that is, reduced
   standard metabolic rates and/or increased metabolic capacity and (2)
   suggest that in juvenile cod, there is no selective advantage to having
   a particular Hb genotype with regards to the capacity to withstand
   ecologically relevant environmental challenges.

AB Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a highly heterozygous
   autotetraploid crop species, and this creates challenges for traditional
   line development and molecular breeding. Recent availability of a
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array with 8303 features and
   software packages for linkage and association mapping in autotetraploid
   species present new opportunities for the identification of genomic
   regions that contribute to high-value traits in cultivated potato. A
   biparental tetraploid potato population was evaluated across three field
   seasons and storage trials in order to identify quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) for multiple tuber traits including fried chip color after 5.5-7.2
   degrees C storage. Tetra-allelic dosage information was used to
   construct a genetic linkage map that covered 1041 cM and contained 2095
   SNP markers with a median marker interval of 0.4 cM. A total of 41 QTL
   were identified for flower color, tuber yield, tuber number per plant,
   tuber weight, tuber size, and chip color after various storage regimes.
   Moderate effect QTL for chip color at 3 months were identified that
   co-localized with candidate genes vacuolar invertase (VInv), invertase
   inhibitor (INH2), and apoplastic invertase (Inv(ap)-b). A separate QTL
   for chip color after 6 months of storage was identified in the short arm
   of chromosome 2, and this locus may contribute to variation in senescent
   sweetening resistance. QTL for tuber weight, length, and width
   co-localized with a known QTL for plant maturity on chromosome 5.
   Genome-wide association mapping using a polyploid model detected the
   tuber size QTL and identified a number of candidate SNPs, but was unable
   to detect markers significantly associated with chip color.

AB An individual-based modeling (IBM) approach was developed to describe
   the behavior of a few Listeria monocytogenes cells contaminating smear
   soft cheese surface. The IBM approach consisted of assessing the
   stochastic individual behaviors of cells on cheese surfaces and knowing
   the characteristics of their surrounding microenvironments. We used a
   microelectrode for pH measurements and micro-osmolality to assess the
   water activity of cheese microsamples. These measurements revealed a
   high variability of microscale pH compared to that of macroscale pH. A
   model describing the increase in pH from approximately 5.0 to more than
   7.0 during ripening was developed. The spatial variability of the cheese
   surface characterized by an increasing pH with radius and higher pH on
   crests compared to that of hollows on cheese rind was also modeled. The
   microscale water activity ranged from approximately 0.96 to 0.98 and was
   stable during ripening. The spatial variability on cheese surfaces was
   low compared to between-cheese variability. Models describing the
   microscale variability of cheese characteristics were combined with the
   IBM approach to simulate the stochastic growth of L. monocytogenes on
   cheese, and these simulations were compared to bacterial counts obtained
   from irradiated cheeses artificially contaminated at different ripening
   stages. The simulated variability of L. monocytogenes counts with the
   IBM/microenvironmental approach was consistent with the observed one.
   Contrasting situations corresponding to no growth or highly contaminated
   foods could be deduced from these models. Moreover, the IBM approach was
   more effective than the traditional population/macroenvironmental
   approach to describe the actual bacterial behavior variability.

AB Aims: To analyse the germination and its heterogeneity of individual
   spores of Clostridium perfringens.
   Methods and Results: Germination of individual wild-type Cl. perfringens
   spores was followed by monitoring Ca-dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) release
   and by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Following
   the addition of KCl that acts via germinant receptors (GRs), there was a
   long variable lag period (T-lag) with slow release of c. 25% of CaDPA,
   then rapid release of remaining CaDPA in c. 2 min (Delta T-release) and
   a parallel decrease in DIC image intensity, and a final decrease of c.
   25% in DIC image intensity during spore cortex hydrolysis. Spores
   lacking the essential cortex-lytic enzyme (CLE) (sleC spores) exhibited
   the same features during GR-dependent germination, but with longer
   average T-lag values, and no decrease in DIC image intensity because of
   cortex hydrolysis after full CaDPA release. The T-lag of wild-type
   spores in KCl germination was increased significantly by lower germinant
   concentrations and suboptimal heat activation. Wild-type and sleC spores
   had identical average T-lag and Delta T-release values in dodecylamine
   germination that does not utilize GRs.
   Conclusions: Most of these results were essentially identical to those
   reported for the germination of individual spores of Bacillus species.
   However, individual sleC Cl. perfringens spores germinated inefficiently
   with either KCl or exogenous CaDPA, in contrast to CLE-deficient
   Bacillus spores, indicating that germination of these species' spores is
   not completely identical.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This work provides information on
   the kinetic germination and its heterogeneity of individual spores of
   Cl. perfringens.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide, but
   its growth and production can be severely affected by climate change. As
   a tropical species, rice is in general vulnerable to the adverse effects
   of low temperature. To cope with or adapt to cold stress condition, rice
   has evolved elaborate regulatory mechanisms under both natural and
   artificial selection. Over the past few decades, intensive research
   efforts have been focused on abiotic stress biology in rice with
   genetic, genomic, and molecular strategies, disclosing a series of
   potential genetic determinants and mechanisms controlling cold stress
   tolerance. Here, we review cold tolerance (CT)-related quantitative
   trait loci (QTLs) identified by linkage and association mapping,
   together with key genes involved in cold sensing, signaling, and
   response. More importantly, recent studies have shown that CT-related
   QTLs/genes can be employed in genomic breeding aiming at developing
   cold-tolerant rice. Overall, the recent research progresses in
   understanding the complex genetic and molecular mechanisms of CT provide
   a substantial basis for CT improvement in rice.

AB Insights from long-term subsistence fisheries data can improve our
   understanding of the population-specific responses of Arctic charr,
   Salvelinus alpinus, to environmental conditions. In this study,
   associations were found between temporal environmental variation and
   Arctic charr length- and weight-based growth using data from fish
   captured in the Hornaday River fishery. Overall, spring precipitation
   and summer air temperature appear to be the most important environmental
   influences on Arctic charr probably because of their respective impacts
   on the opportunities for acquiring surplus energy for growth. A pattern
   of decreasing age-related importance of temperature and increasing
   age-related importance of precipitation suggested that the coupling
   between growth and environmental effects varied by life-period. The
   changing prominence of each variable seems to result from the shift in
   apportioning energy for increases in length to increases in weight,
   likely as a result of the onset of maturation. The linkage of population
   characteristics to environmental conditions provides a baseline
   reference against which future data may be compared to determine the
   significance of any observed changes in population characteristics as a
   result of continuing ecological change in the north.

AB We present a high resolution sedimentary record of dinoflagellate cysts
   spanning the last similar to 900 years recovered from Effingham Inlet, a
   glacial fjord on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. The
   combination of seasonal coastal upwelling supporting high levels of
   marine primary productivity in surface waters, together with restricted
   bottom water circulation in the silled fjord, fosters the preservation
   of laminated sediments in the inner basin of Effingham Inlet.
   Geochemical data are used to assess the sedimentary fades of the core,
   which is composed primarily of laminated units (50.2%) occasionally
   interrupted by "seismites" (39.5%) and homogenous units (102%). The
   chronology of the similar to 2 m-long core is based on varve counting
   and fifteen C-14 dates, and is anchored by a seismite previously dated
   at AD 1946.
   The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are diverse (total of 47 taxa),
   abundant (average concentrations of 102,900 cyst g(-1) of dry sediment),
   and characterized by a proportionally equal contribution of autotrophic
   and heterotrophic cyst taxa in most samples. Overall, cyst assemblages
   are characterized by Operculodinium centrocarpum (362%) accompanied by
   Brigantedinium spp. (18.0%) and Dubridinium spp. (6.6%). Multivariate
   analyses are used to extract the dominant patterns of variability in
   autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellate cyst assemblages
   separately, and help in identifying the temperature and primary
   productivity gradients encoded in the cyst sedimentary record in this
   particular estuary.
   Specific intervals identified in the dinoflagellate cyst record are
   interpreted to represent the local expression of the "Medieval Climate
   Anomaly" (from the base of the record, similar to AD 1090 to 1230), the
   "Little Ice Age" (similar to AD 1230 to late 19th century) and warming
   in the second half of the 20th century. The timing of these intervals
   are consistent with the regional paleoclimate and help constrain past
   climatic and oceanographic variability on the west coast of Vancouver
   Island. The origin of homogenous units in the sedimentary record of
   Effingham Inlet and paleoseismicity in the region are also discussed.

AB Eukaryotic organisms have canonical histones and a number of histone
   variants that perform specialized functions and confer particular
   structural properties to the nucleosomes that contain them. The histone
   H2A family comprises several variants, with H2A.Z being the most
   evolutionarily conserved. This variant is essential in eukaryotes and
   has emerged as a key player in chromatin function, performing an
   essential role in gene transcription and genome stability. During recent
   years, biochemical, genetic and genomic studies have begun to uncover
   the role of several ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes in
   H2A.Z deposition and removal. These ATPase complexes are widely
   conserved from yeast to mammals. In Arabidopsis there are homologs for
   most of the subunits of these complexes, and their functions are just
   beginning to be unveiled. In this review, we discuss the major
   contributions made in relation to the biology of the H2A.Z in plants,
   and more specifically concerning the function of this histone variant in
   the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. Recent
   advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   H2A.Z-mediated modulation of the floral transition, and thermosensory
   flowering responses in particular, are discussed. The emerging picture
   shows that plants contain chromatin-remodeling complexes related to
   those involved in modulating the dynamics of H2A.Z in other eukaryotes,
   but their precise biochemical nature remains elusive.

AB In most studies on cephalopod growth, variability in initial size is
   masked by the assumption of a similar growth " starting point" for all
   hatchlings and by calculating the growth rate (GR) through modelling the
   average size of individuals through time. Statistical interpretations
   based on such models are limited because regression assumptions (e. g.
   homoscedasticity and independence between subjects) are frequently
   violated. To avoid these limitations, generalized linear mixed modelling
   was used to model the early growth of two sets of siblings of the
   holobenthic octopus Octopus maya under controlled conditions. The aim
   was to (i) determine the effect of initial weight (IW) on the GR of
   individuals grouped in three size categories (small, medium, and large),
   (ii) obtain statistically reliable estimates of parameters in an
   exponential growth model for juveniles up to 105 d old, and (iii)
   evaluate the influence of hatching date on weight at hatching. Using
   restricted maximum likelihood, linear models were fitted between (i) IW
   and final weight (FW) for octopuses in each size category, and (ii) the
   natural logarithm of IW as a function of time. The models were validated
   by visually inspecting the residuals. Individual FW depended on IW, but
   GR did not differ between juveniles of different sizes. The exponential
   growth model for individuals of all size categories was, with 1i N(0, s2
   [ agei] 2d). Hatching date had no effect on hatching size (F 1.93; p
   0.11). The GR value is similar to those reported for other holobenthic
   species, and one of the first estimates of the magnitude (d 0.20) and
   structure of the increase in variance of individual weight through time
   is provided.

AB The flexibility afforded to genotypes in different environments by
   phenotypic plasticity is of interest to biologists studying thermal
   adaptation because of the thermal lability of many traits. Differences
   in thermal performance and reaction norms can provide insight into the
   evolution of thermal adaptation to explore broader questions such as
   species distributions and persistence under climate change. One approach
   is to study the effects of temperature on fitness, morphological and
   more recently gene expression traits in populations from different
   climatic origins. The diverse climatic conditions experienced by
   Drosophila melanogaster along the eastern Australian temperate-tropical
   gradient are ideal given the high degree of continuous trait
   differentiation, but reaction norm variation has not been well studied
   in this system. Here, we reared a tropical and temperate population from
   the ends of the gradient over six developmental temperatures and
   examined reaction norm variation for five quantitative traits including
   thermal performance for fecundity, and reaction norms for
   thermotolerance, body size, viability and 23 transcript-level traits.
   Despite genetic variation for some quantitative traits, we found no
   differentiation between the populations for fecundity thermal optima and
   breadth, and the reaction norms for the other traits were largely
   parallel, supporting previous work suggesting that thermal evolution
   occurs by changes in trait means rather than by reaction norm shifts. We
   examined reaction norm variation in our expanded thermal regime for a
   gene set shown to previously exhibit GxE for expression plasticity in
   east Australian flies, as well as key heat-shock genes. Although there
   were differences in curvature between the populations suggesting a
   higher degree of thermal plasticity in expression patterns than for the
   quantitative traits, we found little evidence to support a role for
   genetic variation in maintaining expression plasticity.

AB Thermal developmental plasticity represents a key organismal adaptation
   to maintain reproductive capacity in contrasting and fluctuating
   temperature niches. Although extensively studied, research on thermal
   plasticity has mainly focused on phenotypic outcomes, such as adult life
   history, rather than directly measuring plasticity of underlying
   developmental processes. How thermal plasticity of developmental
   phenotypes maps into plasticity of resulting final phenotypes, and how
   such mapping relationships evolve, thus remain poorly understood. Here
   we address these questions by quantifying thermal plasticity of
   Caenorhabditis hermaphrodite germline development. We integrate
   measurements of germline development and fertility at the upper thermal
   range in isolates of C. briggsae, C. elegans, and C. tropicalis. First,
   we compare intra- and interspecific variation in thermal germline
   plasticity with plasticity in reproductive output. Second, we ask
   whether the developmental errors leading to fertility break-down at
   upper thermal limits are evolutionarily conserved. We find that
   temperature variation modulates spermatogenesis, oogenesis and germ cell
   progenitor pools, yet the thermal sensitivity of these processes varies
   among isolates and species, consistent with evolutionary variation in
   upper thermal limits of hermaphrodite fertility. Although defective
   sperm function is a major contributor to heat-induced fertility
   break-down, high temperature also significantly perturbs oogenesis,
   germline integrity, and mitosis-meiosis progression. Remarkably, the
   occurrence and frequency of specific errors are strongly species- and
   genotype-dependent, indicative of evolutionary divergence in thermal
   sensitivity of distinct processes in germline development. Therefore,
   the Caenorhabditis reproductive system displays complex
   genotype-by-temperature interactions at the developmental level, which
   may remain masked when studying thermal plasticity exclusively at the
   life history level.

AB Foliar respiration is a major component of ecosystem respiration, yet
   extrapolations are often uncertain in tropical forests because of
   indirect estimates of leaf area index (LAI). A portable tower was used
   to directly measure LAI and night-time foliar respiration from 52
   vertical transects throughout an old-growth tropical rain forest in
   Costa Rica. In this study, we (1) explored the effects of structural,
   functional and environmental variables on foliar respiration; (2)
   extrapolated foliar respiration to the ecosystem; and (3) estimated
   ecosystem respiration. Foliar respiration temperature response was
   constant within plant functional group, and foliar morphology drove much
   of the within-canopy variability in respiration and foliar nutrients.
   Foliar respiration per unit ground area was 3.5 +/- 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2)
   s(-1), and ecosystem respiration was 9.4 +/- 0.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)
   [soil = 41%; foliage = 37%; woody = 14%; coarse woody debris (CWD) =
   7%]. When modelled with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year
   temperatures, foliar respiration was 9% greater than when modelled with
   temperatures from a normal year, which is in the range of carbon sink
   versus source behaviour for this forest. Our ecosystem respiration
   estimate from component fluxes was 33% greater than night-time net
   ecosystem exchange for the same forest, suggesting that studies
   reporting a large carbon sink for tropical rain forests based solely on
   eddy flux measurements may be in error.

AB Species with "slow" life history strategies (long life, low fecundity)
   are thought to produce high-quality offspring by investing in larger,
   but fewer, young. Larger eggs are indeed associated with fewer eggs
   across taxa and can yield higher-quality offspring. Tropical passerines
   appear to follow theory because they commonly exhibit slow life history
   strategies and produce larger, but fewer, eggs compared with northern
   species. Yet, I show here that relative egg mass (corrected for adult
   mass) varies extensively in the tropics and subtropics for the same
   clutch size, and this variation is unexplained. I propose a hypothesis
   to explain egg size variation both within the tropics and between
   latitudes: Relative egg mass increases in species with cooler egg
   temperatures and longer embryonic periods to offset associated increases
   in energetic requirements of embryos. Egg temperatures of birds are
   determined by parental incubation behavior and are often cooler among
   tropical passerines because of reduced parental attentiveness of eggs.
   Here, I show that cooler egg temperatures and longer embryonic periods
   explained the enigmatic variation in egg mass within and among regions,
   based on field studies in tropical Venezuela (36 species), subtropical
   Argentina (16 species), and north temperate Arizona (20 species).
   Alternative explanations are not supported. Thus, large egg sizes may
   reflect compensation for increased energetic requirements of cool egg
   temperatures and long embryonic periods that result from reduced
   parental attentiveness in tropical birds.

AB In Norway sea ranching depends on deployment of animals of local origin,
   and growers demand large spat outside the natural production season. To
   develop stock-specific production of juveniles, knowledge on local
   scallop reproductive cycle and performance in hatchery was needed.
   Broodstock sized scallops (Pecten maximus) were collected from 5
   locations along the coast of Norway from 59 degrees N to 65 degrees N
   during 2004 and 2005, and translocated to natural sea location at 61 N.
   The reproductive cycles were characterised and the possibility of
   performing successful hatchery conditioning and spawning outside the
   natural reproduction cycle was investigated.
   Results showed that scallops from south-western Norway (3 locations) all
   had distinct season summer peaks in the reproductive cycles. Scallops
   from the northern part (2 locations) quickly rebuilt the gonad after
   spawning and seemed to have full gonads through most of the year. Gonad
   indices in the southern group varied between 5 and 15%, while in the
   northern group it was 10 to 25% of total tissue weight. Both in December
   and March most individuals (>75%) in the southern group had empty
   gonads, while most individuals in the northern group were characterised
   as being in gonad maturation stages 3-6. There was no complete
   synchronous gonad development through the year, and most developmental
   stages were present at all times. Scallops from the southern locations
   showed small changes in gonad maturation after translocation to the new
   environment. Scallops from northern locations kept the original cycle,
   but seemed to spawn later in summer. Scallops from the 3 southern
   locations responded to conditioning methods in the hatchery from late
   autumn to spring, as did one of the northern populations, while the
   other northern population could not be conditioned in winter. Based on
   reproductive cycle and hatchery performance we suggest that scallops
   from the 5 locations belonged to 3 distinct different populations. The
   differences in timing of gametogenesis and response to conditioning
   environment have implications for spat production in the hatchery and
   must be accounted for in order to fulfil the requirements of
   site-specific spat for scallop sea ranching in Norway. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Identifying factors and processes influencing natural mortality is
   fundamental to the understanding of population dynamics. Metabolic
   theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cross-species level
   suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to
   body mass and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar
   relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, possibly because of
   the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by
   most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links
   between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel
   Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range,
   provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30
   years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle
   for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality,
   considering the effects of body mass, temperature, stock density and
   gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper
   extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates
   (ranging between 0.02 year(-1) at 8A degrees C, low density and 0.47
   year(-1) at 18A degrees C, high density for a body mass of 100 g) were
   appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the
   exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel.

AB Microtubules provide the mechanical force required for chromosome
   separation during mitosis. However, little is known about the dynamic
   (high-frequency) mechanical properties of microtubules. Here, we
   theoretically propose to control the vibrations of a doubly clamped
   microtubule by tip electrodes and to detect its motion via the
   optomechanical coupling between the vibrational modes of the microtubule
   and an optical cavity. In the presence of a red-detuned strong pump
   laser, this coupling leads to optomechanical-induced transparency of an
   optical probe field, which can be detected with state-of-the art
   technology. The center frequency and line width of the transparency peak
   give the resonance frequency and damping rate of the microtubule,
   respectively, while the height of the peak reveals information about the
   microtubule-cavity field coupling. Our method opens the new
   possibilities to gain information about the physical properties of
   microtubules, which will enhance our capability to design physical
   cancer treatment protocols as alternatives to chemotherapeutic drugs.

AB In mammals, the pineal hormone melatonin is thought to be essential to
   process environmental photoperiodic information. In this study, we
   demonstrate in a circannual species, the European hamster Cricetus
   cricetus, the existence of a melatonin-independent second pathway. In 4
   physiological parameters (reproduction, body weight, activity pattern,
   body temperature), a large majority of pinealectomized European hamsters
   were entrained to an accelerated photoperiodic regime. It compressed the
   natural variations in the photoperiod to a 6-month cycle, which allowed
   us to record up to 6 complete physiological cycles during the life span
   of the individuals. We show further that whether a pinealectomized
   animal is able to entrain to changes in the photoperiod is influenced by
   the season of pinealectomy. The results do not disprove that melatonin
   is capable of entraining a circannual rhythm, but they show clearly that
   melatonin is not necessary, demonstrating another melatonin-independent
   pathway for circannual entrainment by the photoperiod. In view of these
   new insights, a revision of the original literature revealed that
   probably the melatonin-independent pathway plays an important role in
   most circannual mammals but only a minor role in photoperiodic species.
   Thus, the present work provides also the first evidence for different
   synchronization mechanisms in photoperiodic and circannual species.

AB Models for the transmission of the chikungunya virus to human population
   are discussed. The chikungunya virus is an alpha arbovirus, first
   identified in 1953. It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and is
   responsible for a little documented uncommon acute tropical disease.
   Models describing the mosquito population dynamics and the virus
   transmission to the human population are discussed. Global analysis of
   equilibria are given, which use on the one hand Lyapunov functions and
   on the other hand results of the theory of competitive systems and
   stability of periodic orbits. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Natural selection varies widely among locations of a species' range,
   favoring population divergence and adaptation to local environmental
   conditions. Selection also differs between females and males, favoring
   the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Both forms of within-species
   evolutionary diversification are widely studied, though largely in
   isolation, and it remains unclear whether environmental variability
   typically generates similar or distinct patterns of selection on each
   sex. Studies of sex-specific local adaptation are also challenging
   because they must account for genetic correlations between female and
   male traits, which may lead to correlated patterns of trait divergence
   between sexes, whether or not local selection patterns are aligned or
   differ between the sexes. We quantified sex-specific divergence in five
   clinally variable traits in Drosophila melanogaster that individually
   vary in their magnitude of cross-sex genetic correlation (i.e., from
   moderate to strongly positive). In all five traits, we observed parallel
   male and female clines, regardless of the magnitude of their genetic
   correlation. These patterns imply that parallel spatial divergence of
   female and male traits is a reflection of sexually concordant
   directional selection imposed by local environmental conditions. In such
   contexts, genetic correlations between the sexes promote, rather than
   constrain, local adaptation to a spatially variable environment.

AB The effect of pH and water activity (a(w)) on the formation of biofilm
   by Salmonella enterica ser. Newport, previously identified as a strong
   biofilm producer, was assessed. Biofilm formation was evaluated in
   tryptone soy broth at 37 degrees C and at different combinations of pH
   (3.3-7.8) and a(w) (0.894-0.997). In total, 540 biofilm formation tests
   in 108 pH and aw combinations were carried out in polystyrene microtiter
   plates using crystal violet staining and optical density (OD; 580 nm)
   measurements. Since the individual effects of pH and aw on biofilm
   formation had a similar pattern to that observed for microbial growth
   rate, cardinal parameter models (CPMs) were used to describe these
   effects. CPMs described successfully the effects of these two
   environmental parameters, with the estimated cardinal values of pH(min),
   pH(opt), pH(max), a(wmin) and a(wopt) being 3.58, 6.02, 9.71, 0.894 and
   0.994, respectively. The CPMs assumption of the multiplicative
   inhibitory effect of environmental factors was validated in the case of
   biofilm formation using additional independent data (i.e. 430 OD data at
   86 different combinations of pH and a(w)). The validation results showed
   a good agreement (r(2) = 0.938) between observed and predicted OD with
   no systematic error. In the second part of this study, a probabilistic
   model predicting the pathogen's biofilm formation boundaries was
   developed, and the degree of agreement between predicted probabilities
   and observations was as high as 99.8%. Hence, the effect of
   environmental parameters on biofilm formation can be quantitatively
   expressed using mathematical models, with the latter models, in turn,
   providing useful information for biofilm control in food industry
   environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biochemistry of fatty acids (FA) can be affected by a number of
   factors, including environmental temperature, which may affect the way
   FAs are physiologically metabolized. In this study, we investigated FAs
   in Pachygrapsus crassipes, in relation to environmental temperatures in
   southern California. Although there was a trend toward differences in FA
   abundances in the hepatopancreas of females compared with those found in
   the hepatopancreas of males, these differences were not significant
   through most of the year. The sampling month influenced changes in the
   abundances of both individual FAs (identities) and FA saturation
   categories (saturated = SAFA, monounsaturated = MUFA, polyunsaturated =
   PUFA). The abundances of palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, and
   docosahexaenoic acid were found to fluctuate significantly over time,
   although this fluctuation did not appear to be directly influenced by
   temperature since an increase in FA abundance between February and April
   preceded an increase in temperature. In all months except for June,
   PUFAs dominated the FA profile. Changes in FAs may be an acclimatory
   mechanism used by P. crassipes to take advantage of specific biochemical
   properties of FAs. We conclude that, while temperature may affect FA
   abundance and composition, other underlying factors, such as changes in
   day length, food availability, molting, mating and reproduction, may
   also influence FA abundances in P. crassipes from southern California.

AB Using thermal growth data from eight populations of anadromous and
   lake-feeding brown trout Salmo trutta, hypotheses of adaptation to local
   optima and countergradient variation in growth were tested. The
   adaptation to local optima hypothesis suggests that natural selection
   can shift optimal performance temperatures to match the prevailing
   temperature in a new or changed thermal niche. In contradiction, the
   countergradient variation hypothesis suggests that populations from
   hostile environments perform better than conspecifics from benign
   environments at all temperatures. In this study, growth capacity varied
   between populations but there was no significant correlation between any
   of the estimated thermal performance parameters (e.g. lower and upper
   thermal growth limits, optimal temperature for growth and maximum growth
   capacity) and natural climatic conditions among populations. Hence, S.
   trutta growth response to temperature lends no support for either of the
   two suggested thermal adaptation hypotheses. Instead, growth capacity
   among populations tended to correlate positively with female size at
   maturity.

AB Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA), predictive
   modelling and HACCP may be used as tools to increase food safety and can
   be integrated fruitfully for many purposes. However, when QMRA is
   applied for public health issues like the evaluation of the status of
   public health, existing predictive models may not be suited to model
   bacterial growth. In this context, precise quantification of risks is
   more important than in the context of food manufacturing alone. In this
   paper, the modular process risk model (MPRM) is briefly introduced as a
   QMRA modelling framework. This framework can be used to model the
   transmission of pathogens through any food pathway, by assigning one of
   six basic processes (modules) to each of the processing steps. Bacterial
   growth is one of these basic processes. For QMRA, models of bacterial
   growth need to be expressed in terms of probability, for example to
   predict the probability that a critical concentration is reached within
   a certain amount of time. In contrast, available predictive models are
   developed and validated to produce point estimates of population sizes
   and therefore do not fit with this requirement. Recent experience from a
   European risk assessment project is discussed to illustrate some of the
   problems that may arise when predictive growth models are used in QMRA.
   It is suggested that a new type of predictive models needs to be
   developed that incorporates modelling of variability and uncertainty in
   growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   for the conduct of human and animal biological rhythm research and
   recommend essential elements for quality chronobiological research
   information, which should be especially useful for new investigators of
   the rhythms of life. A secondary objective is to provide for those with
   an interest in the results of chronobiology investigations, but who
   might be unfamiliar with the field, an introduction to the basic methods
   and standards of biological rhythm research and time series data
   analysis. The journal and its editors endorse compliance of all
   investigators to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of the
   World Medical Association, which relate to the conduct of ethical
   research on human beings, and the Guide for the Care and Use of
   Laboratory Animals of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of
   the National Research Council, which relate to the conduct of ethical
   research on laboratory and other animals. The editors and the readers of
   the journal expect the authors of submitted manuscripts to have adhered
   to the ethical standards dictated by local, national, and international
   laws and regulations in the conduct of investigations and to be unbiased
   and accurate in reporting never-before-published research findings.
   Authors of scientific papers are required to disclose all potential
   conflicts of interest, particularly when the research is funded in part
   or in full by the medical and pharmaceutical industry, when the authors
   are stock-holders of the company that manufactures or markets the
   products under study, or when the authors are a recent or current paid
   consultant to the involved company. It is the responsibility of the
   authors of submitted manuscripts to clearly present sufficient detail
   about the synchronizer schedule of the studied subjects (i.e., the
   sleep-wake schedule, ambient light-dark cycle, intensity and spectrum of
   ambient light exposure, seasons when the research was conducted, shift
   schedule in studies involving shift work, and menstrual cycle stage in
   studies involving young women). Rhythm analysis of time series data
   should be performed with the perspective that rhythms of different
   periods might be superimposed upon the observed temporal pattern of
   interest. A variety of different and complementary statistical
   procedures can be used for rhythm detection. Fitting a mathematical
   model to the time series data provides a better and more objective
   analysis of time series data than simple data inspection and narrative
   description, and if rhythmicity is documented by objective methods, its
   characterization is required by relevant parameters such as the rhythm's
   period (tau), MESOR (time series average), amplitude (range of temporal
   variation), acrophase (time of peak value), and bathyphase (time of
   trough value). However, the assumptions underlying the time series
   modeling must be satisfied and applicable in each case, especially the
   assumption of sinusoidality in the case of cosinor analaysis, before it
   can be accepted as appropriate. An important aspect of the peer review
   of manuscripts submitted to Chronobiology International entails judgment
   of the conformity of research protocols and methods to the standards
   described in this article.

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between deep sedimentary fluxes and
   ocean current vertical velocities in an offshore area of the Ionian Sea,
   the deepest basin of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Sediment trap data
   are collected at 500 m and 2800 m depth in two successive moorings
   covering the period September 1999-May 2001. A tight coupling is
   observed between the upper and deep traps and the estimated particle
   sinking rates are more than 200 m day(-1). The current vertical velocity
   field is computed from a 1/16 degrees x 1/16 degrees Ocean General
   Circulation Model simulation and from the wind stress curl. Current
   vertical velocities are larger and more variable than Ekman vertical
   velocities, yet the general patterns are alike. Current vertical
   velocities are generally smaller than 1 m day(-1): we therefore exclude
   a direct effect of downward velocities in determining high sedimentation
   rates. However we find that upward velocities in the subsurface layers
   of the water column are positively correlated with deep particle fluxes.
   We thus hypothesize that upwelling would produce an increase in upper
   ocean nutrient levels-thus stimulating primary production and grazing-a
   few weeks before an enhanced vertical flux is found in the sediment
   traps. High particle sedimentation rates may be attained by means of
   rapidly sinking fecal pellets produced by gelatinous macro-zooplankton.
   Other sedimentation mechanisms, such as dust deposition, are also
   considered in explaining large pulses of deep particle fluxes. The fast
   sinking rates estimated in this study might be an evidence of the
   efficiency of the biological pump in sequestering organic carbon from
   the surface layers of the deep Eastern Mediterranean basins.

   variability in terms of pH (ranging from 2.8 to 7), with high
   concentrations of heavy metals, including up to 20 g Fe/l, 80 mg Zn/l,

   older adults in Canada do not engage in enough PA to sustain fitness and
   functional independence. Environmental influences, such as warmer
   daytime temperatures, may influence PA participation; however, few
   studies have examined the effect of summertime temperatures on PA levels
   in older adults. This investigation measured the influence of summertime
   weather variables on PA in 48 community-dwelling older adults who were
   randomly recruited from a local seniors' community centre. Each
   participant wore an accelerometer for a single 7-consecutive-day period
   ( between 30 May and 9 August 2006) during waking hours, and completed a
   PA logbook to remark on major daily PA events. Local weather variables
   were collected from a national weather service and compared with PA
   counts per minute. Regression analysis revealed a curvilinear
   relationship between log-transformed PA and mean daily temperature (r(2)
   = 0.025; p < 0.05). Linear mixed effects models that accounted for
   repeated measures nested within individuals were performed for monthly
   periods, meteorological variables, sex, age, and estimated maximal
   oxygen consumption, with PA as the dependent variable. Age and Air
   Quality Index remained significant variables within the model. Higher
   fitness levels had no effect on allowing individuals to perform more
   vigorous PA in warmer temperatures.

AB Loma salmonae (Putz, Hoffman et Dunbar, 1965) is a common gill parasite
   of salmonids, and essentially all species in the genus Oncorhynchus are
   susceptible. Infections occur in both fresh and salt water. Loma
   salmonae is directly transmissible by ingestion of spores or infected
   tissue. The parasite infects the wall of blood vessels of various
   organs, but the gill is the primary site of infection. Initial infection
   occurs in the intestine, and xenomas are easily detected in the gills by
   standard histology at 4-6 wk post-exposure. A few presporogonic stages
   of the parasite are found in the heart endothelium prior to xenoma
   formation in the gills. Ultrastructure studies of early infections
   demonstrated that wandering blood cells transport the meronts to the
   gills, and that merogony occurs in pillar cells and other cells
   underlying the gill endothelium. Xenomas develop in these cells,
   resulting in hypertrophied host cells filled with spores. Xenomas
   ultimately rupture, and are associated with severe inflammation in which
   free spores are found in macrophages. The parasites are most pathogenic
   during this phase of the infection, resulting in severe vasculitis and
   clinical disease. Both rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook
   salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) recover from infections, but free
   spores persist in kidney and spleen phagocytes for many months after
   xenomas are absent in Chinook salmon. Fish that have recovered from the
   infection show strong immunity against the parasite, lasting up to I
   year. Fish are susceptible to infection by other routes of exposure by
   spores; co-habitation, anal gavage, and intramuscular, intraperitoneal
   and intravascular injection. Autoinfection probably occurs following
   release of spores in blood vessels after xenomas rupture. The optimal
   temperature for L. salmonae infections is 15-17 degrees C, with a
   permissive range of 11-20 degrees C.

AB Bryozoans are colonial benthic marine invertebrate calcifiers, important
   and especially abundant and diverse in southern hemisphere shelf
   environments. Large heavily calcified colonies can be up to 50 years
   old, but most longer-lived bryozoans are limited to 10-20 y. Many
   smaller species are annual. Radial extension in flat encrusting
   bryozoans is generally on the order of 1-5 mm/y. Erect calcified species
   generally grow vertically 2-15 mm/y, though articulated species such as
   Cellaria may reach rates of 40 mm/y. Corresponding calcification rates
   are generally 10(1)-10(2) mg/y, but there can be an order of magnitude
   variation in rate among years in high-latitude bryozoans. Multi-branched
   bryozoans produce up to 24 g of CaCO3/y. The carbonate produced by
   bryozoans varies from calcite to aragonite and mixtures of both.
   Skeletal carbonate mineralogy of bryozoans is complex and appears to be
   strongly genetically controlled. Global climate change, leading to
   increasing water temperatures, will generally increase marine bryozoan
   metabolic rates, and may increase Mg in calcite. On the other hand,
   decreasing pH (ocean acidification) causes corrosion, changes in
   mineralogy, and decreased survival. This review of bryozoan growth and
   calcification allows a general perspective, but also reveals gaps in our
   knowledge which need to be addressed.

AB In predictive microbiology, the study of the microbial lag phase, i.e.,
   the time needed for bacteria to adapt to a new environment before
   multiplying, has received a great deal of attention in the research
   literature. The microbial lag phase is more difficult to estimate than
   the specific growth rate because the lag phase is impacted by the
   previous and actual growth environments. In this study, the growth of
   Listeria monocytogenes preincubated at 0, 5, 10, and 15 degrees C and
   subsequently grown at 25 degrees C was investigated at the single-cell
   and population levels. The population lag phase of L. monocytogenes was
   obtained by fitting the Baranyi model, and the single-cell lag time was
   estimated by the time to detection method. The lag phase at the
   single-cell and population levels of L. monocytogenes presented a
   downward trend as the preculture temperature ranged from 0 to 15 degrees
   C. The population lag phase of L. monocytogenes was lower than the
   single-cell lag time at the same preculture temperature. In addition,
   except for the zero-lag distribution at a preculture temperature of 15
   degrees C, all the single-cell lag time distributions of L.
   monocytogenes followed a Weibull distribution under all preculture
   temperatures. The preculture temperature had a significant impact on the
   rapid variation in the single-cell lag time distribution. Thus, the
   influence of preculture temperature on the lag phase needs to be
   quantitatively analyzed for better assessment of microbiological risk.

AB Resource pulses provide consumers with opportunities to feed at high
   rates. The spawning and die-off of semelparous Pacific salmon provide
   consumers with feeding opportunities that contribute substantially to
   annual energy budgets. The life history of Pacific salmon also includes
   the downstream migration of smolts, which could provide similar
   opportunities for consumers to exploit. We tracked seasonal movements of
   adult Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus in and out of the Chilko
   Lake-River outlet in interior British Columbia, which is characterized
   by a large Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka population. Use of the
   outlet, lake, and river habitats were compared with the timing of
   out-migrations of Sockeye Salmon smolt and the spawning events of
   Sockeye Salmon, Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha, and Coho Salmon O.
   kisutch. Bull Trout activity and residency in the outlet increased
   during the spring Sockeye Salmon smolt out-migration, and 40% of Bull
   Trout were found to return to the outlet in successive years. During
   Sockeye Salmon spawning, Bull Trout residency was increased in the river
   where most Sockeye Salmon spawning occurs. Therefore, Bull Trout may
   exploit both life history events, although direct consumption of eggs
   was not observed. Spawning by Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon in the
   river did not appear to attract Bull Trout; Bull Trout residency
   increased in the lake (where spawning does not occur) during these
   times. Bull Trout residency in the lake also increased when outlet water
   temperatures were >16 degrees C, and thus the lake may provide thermal
   refuge when river temperatures are above optima for this coldwater char.
   This research demonstrates that movements of aquatic consumers can
   depend upon smolt out-migrations, and such movements can allow
   exploitation of multiple pulses that are seasonally distinct. These
   results also highlight the ecological significance of Pacific salmon for
   consumers in freshwater systems.

AB There is emerging concern over the impact of extreme events such as
   heavy rainfall on the quality of water entering the drinking water
   supply from aboveground sources, as such events are expected to increase
   in magnitude and frequency in response to climate change. We compared
   the impact of rainfall events on streamwater quality in four contrasting
   upland (peatland and mineral soil) and lowland agricultural catchments
   used to supply drinking water in France (Brittany) and the United
   Kingdom (North Wales) by analyzing water samples collected before,
   during, and after specific events. At all four streams, heavy rainfall
   led to a considerable rise in organic matter concentration ranging from
   48 to 158%. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality, as determined using
   specific ultraviolet absorbance, changed consistently at all sites
   during rainfall events, with a greater proportion of aromatic and higher
   molecular weight compounds following the onset of rainfall. However, the
   change in DOC quality and quantity did not significantly alter the
   trihalomethane formation potential. We observed small increases in
   trihalomethane (THM) generation only at the Welsh peatland and
   agricultural sites and a small decrease at the Brittany agricultural
   site. The proportion of brominated THMs in chlorinated waters was
   positively correlated with bromide/DOC ratio in raw waters for all sites
   and hydrological conditions. These results provide a first indication of
   the potential implications for surface-based drinking water resources
   resulting from expected future increases in rainfall event intensity and
   extension of dry periods with climate changes.

AB Alvinella pompejana lives on the top of chimneys at deep-sea
   hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise. It is thought to be one of
   the most thermotolerant and eurythermal metazoans. Our experimental
   approach combines methods of population genetics and biochemistry,
   considering temperature as a potential selective factor.
   Phosphoglucomutase (Pgm-1 locus) is one of the most polymorphic loci of
   A. pompejana and exhibits four alleles, from which alleles 90 and 100
   dominate with frequencies of approximately 0.5 in populations. Results
   from previous studies suggested that allele 90 might be more
   thermostable than allele 100. Significant genetic differentiation was
   found by comparing contrasted microhabitats, especially the young, still
   hot, versus older and colder chimneys, with allele 90 being at highest
   frequency on young chimneys. Moreover the frequency of allele 90 was
   positively correlated with mean temperature at the opening of Alvinella
   tubes. In parallel, thermostability and thermal optimum experiments
   demonstrated that allele 90 is more thermostable and more active at
   higher temperatures than allele 100. This dataset supports an additive
   model of diversifying selection in which allele 90 is favoured on young
   hot chimneys but counterbalanced over the whole metapopulation by the
   dynamics of the vent ecosystem.

   taxonomic status of the specimen was confirmed by nucleotide sequences
   of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I and 28S ribosomal DNA.
   Oxygen isotopic analysis (delta O-18(sh)) and histology were used to
   determine the specimen's age and reproductive stage, which were 3.5
   years and ripe male, respectively. This BLP oyster most likely
   originated in an area in the subtropics or tropics, such as the Okinawa
   archipelagic or Micronesian regions. We suggest that intensive

AB SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) related genes have important functions in
   regulating floral transition and inflorescence structure in many plant
   species. Some SVP related genes have been shown associated with dormancy
   transition. Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis exhibits summer dormancy
   release and floral transition promoted by extended high temperature
   exposure. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such development
   remains unknown. In this study, we isolated and characterized one
   SVP-like gene, NSVP1 from N. tazetta var. chinensis. The results of
   RT-PCR and in situ hybridization assay showed that NSVP1 was expressed
   in both vegetative and floral tissues. The highest level of NSVP1 in the
   bulb apices was detected when the above-ground just senesced and its
   transcripts declined gradually during endo-dormany. The lowest level was
   found at the beginning of flower differentiation and the release of
   endo-dormancy. These data suggest that NSVP1 is differentially regulated
   coordinately with endodormancy induction and release. Ectopic expression
   of NSVP1 neither complemented the early flowering phenotype of svp
   mutant nor altered the rosette leaf number in Col background. However,
   NSVP1 in svp mutant and Ler plants increased the number of lateral
   inflorescence and caused abnormal floral morphologies. In addition,
   strong expression of NSVP1 in Ler background affected plastochron. These
   results suggest that NSVP1 might play a role in the regulation of flower
   development. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

   calculated and exhibited a monotonically decreasing reaction norm.
   Intraclass correlations were on average quite low, with no significant
   differences between traits, temperature or sex; a highly significant
   trait-temperature interaction was, however, observed. Sex dimorphism was
   very low in Zaprionus. contrasting with data previously obtained in
   other species. MVs among lines were positively correlated for the three
   size-related traits, whereas sternopleural bristle and ovariole number
   were genetically independent. TMVs were different between the traits,
   but higher than in D. melanogaster and other cold-adapted species, in
   agreement with the hypothesis that the norm shape evolves according to
   species thermal adaptation. MVs and TMVs were never correlated,
   indicating that mean values and plasticity are genetically independent.
   Some positive correlations were observed among TMVs of different traits,
   suggesting that the same genetic system might regulate plasticity of
   different traits.

AB Tobacco streak virus suppressed post-transcriptional gene silencing and
   caused a flower color change in black dahlias, which supported the role
   of cyanidin-based anthocyanins for black flower appearance.
   Black flower color of dahlia (Dahlia variabilis) has been attributed, in
   part, to the high accumulation of cyanidin-based anthocyanins that
   occurs when flavone synthesis is reduced because of post-transcriptional
   gene silencing (PTGS) of flavone synthase II (DvFNS). There are also
   purple-flowering plants that have emerged from a black cultivar
   'Kokucho'. We report that the purple color is not caused by a mutation,
   as previously thought, but by infection with tobacco streak virus
   (TSVdahlia), which suppresses the PTGS of DvFNS. When TSVdahlia was
   eliminated from the purple-flowering 'Kokucho' by leaf primordia-free
   shoot apical meristem culture, the resulting flowers were black.
   TSVdahlia-infected purple flowers had lower numbers of siRNAs to DvFNS
   than black flowers, suggesting that TSVdahlia has a silencing
   suppressor. The graft inoculation of other black cultivars with
   TSVdahlia altered their flower color drastically except for 'Fidalgo
   Blacky', a very deep black cultivar with the highest amount of
   cyanidin-based anthocyanins. The flowers of all six TSVdahlia-infected
   cultivars accumulated increased amounts of flavones and reduced amounts
   of cyanidin-based anthocyanins. 'Fidalgo Blacky' remained black despite
   the change in pigment accumulation, and the amounts of cyanidin-based
   anthocyanins in its TSVdahlia-infected plants were still higher than
   those of other cultivars. We propose that black flower color in dahlia
   is controlled by two different mechanisms that increase the amount of
   cyanidin-based anthocyanins: DvFNS PTGS-dependent and -independent
   mechanisms. If both mechanisms occur simultaneously, the flower color
   will be blacker than if only a single mechanism is active.

AB Prior research has suggested that regional weather patterns impact the
   risk of rupture of cerebral aneurysms, but the findings in the
   literature have been inconsistent. Furthermore, no nationwide analysis
   to date has examined the association between meteorological factors and
   the post-procedural outcomes of patients after the treatment for
   ruptured cerebral aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to use a
   nationwide sample to analyze the association between specific
   meteorological parameters-temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and
   humidity-and hospital admission rate for and outcome after aneurysmal
   subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients were identified using the Nationwide
   Inpatient Sample (2001-2010): Those with an ICD-9 diagnosis code for
   subarachnoid hemorrhage and a procedural code for aneurysm repair were
   included. Climate data were obtained from the State of the Climate
   Report 2010 released by the National Climatic Data Center. Multivariate
   regression models were constructed to analyze the association between
   average state monthly temperature, precipitation, and percent possible
   sunlight, as well as relative morning humidity and both monthly hospital
   admission rate, adjusted for annual state population in millions, and
   in-hospital mortality. 16,970 admissions were included from 723
   hospitals across 41 states. Decreased daily sunlight and lower relative
   humidity were associated with an increased rate of admission for
   ruptured cerebral aneurysms (p<0.001), but had no association with
   differential inpatient mortality. No significant changes in these
   observed associations were seen when multivariate analyses were
   constructed. This is the first nationwide study to suggest that
   decreased sunlight and lower relative humidity are associated with
   admission for ruptured cerebral aneurysms. While it has been postulated
   that external atmospheric factors may cause hormonal and homeostatic
   changes that impact the risk of rupture of cerebral aneurysms,
   additional research is needed to confirm and further understand these
   relationships.

   administered during the early night induce phase-delays of locomotor

   necrosis factor (Tnf)-alpha and its receptor 1/p55 (Tnfr1) in the
   modulation of LPS-induced circadian effects on the suprachiasmatic
   nucleus (SCN). We observed that Tnfr1-defective mice (Tnfr1 KO),
   although exhibiting similar circadian behavior and light response to
   that of control mice, did not show LPS-induced phase-delays of locomotor
   activity rhythms, nor LPS-induced cFos and Per2 expression in the SCN
   and Per1 expression in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) as
   compared to wild-type (WT) mice. We also analyzed Tnfr1 expression in
   the SCN of WT mice, peaking during the early night, when LPS has a
   circadian effect. Peripheral inoculation of LPS induced an increase in
   cytokine/chemokine levels (Tnf, Il-6 and Ccl2) in the SCN and in the
   PVN. In conclusion, in this study, we show that LPS-induced circadian
   responses are mediated by Tnf. Our results also suggest that this
   cytokine stimulates the SCN after LPS peripheral inoculation; and the
   time-related effect of LPS (i.e. phase shifts elicited only at early
   night) might depend on the increased levels of Tnfr1 expression. We also
   confirmed that LPS modulates clock gene expression in the SCN and PVN in
   WT but not in Tnfr1 KO mice.
   Highlights: We demonstrate a fundamental role for Tnf and its receptor
   in circadian modulation by immune stimuli at the level of the SCN
   biological clock.

AB This paper describes the skeletal carbonate mineralogy of 156 bryozoan
   species collected from Scotland (sourced both from museum collections
   and from waters around Scotland) and collated from literature. This
   collection represents 79% of the species which inhabit Scottish waters
   and is a greater number and proportion of extant species than any
   previous regional study. The study is also of significance globally
   where the data augment the growing database of mineralogical analyses
   and offers first analyses for 26 genera and four families. Specimens
   were collated through a combination of field sampling and existing
   collections and were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-XRD
   to determine wt% MgCO3 in calcite and wt% aragonite. Species
   distribution data and phylogenetic organisation were applied to
   understand distributional, taxonomic and phylo-mineralogical patterns.
   Analysis of the skeletal composition of Scottish bryozoans shows that
   the group is statistically different from neighbouring Arctic fauna but
   features a range of mineralogy comparable to other temperate regions. As
   has been previously reported, cyclostomes feature low Mg in calcite and
   very little aragonite, whereas cheilostomes show much more variability,
   including bimineralic species. Scotland is a highly variable region,
   open to biological and environmental influx from all directions, and
   bryozoans exhibit this in the wide range of within-species mineralogical
   variability they present. This plasticity in skeletal composition may be
   driven by a combination of environmentally-induced phenotypic variation,
   or physiological factors. A flexible response to environment, as
   manifested in a wide range of skeletal mineralogy within a species, may
   be one characteristic of successful invasive bryozoans.

AB Sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari Zehntner (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is
   now widely established in sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench (Poaceae),
   production areas of the USA, and is an important economic pest. To
   calculate economic thresholds, population growth parameters under varied
   temperature conditions are needed. However, detailed laboratory studies
   of temperature effects on the biology and population parameters of M.
   sacchari since the sorghum outbreak in the US have not been performed
   previously. Therefore, this study evaluated the response of M. sacchari
   to 6 different constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, and 35 degrees
   C) on sorghum tissue. Aphid development, age-specific survivorship,
   fecundity, and longevity were compared at the mentioned temperatures. At
   20 degrees C, the reproductive period was longest and total fecundity
   was greatest. Development time of M. sacchari was shortest at 25 and 30
   C. Intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 25 degrees C (r(m) = 0.405
   +/- 0.030). Net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest at 20 degrees C, and
   age-specific survivorship decreased with increasing temperature. At 25
   degrees C, aphid populations doubled in 1.7 d, the shortest among all
   temperatures tested. Using a modification of the nonlinear Logan model,
   the lower and upper developmental thresholds of M. sacchari were
   calculated at 8.6 and 37.8 degrees C, respectively, with the optimum
   temperature for development occurring at 28.3 degrees C. Population
   parameters, together with high minimum and maximum thermal thresholds,
   indicate that M. sacchari is an aphid species adapted to higher
   temperatures.

AB Sponges host diverse and complex communities of microbial symbionts that
   display a high degree of host specificity. The microbiomes of
   conspecific sponges are relatively constant, even across distant
   locations, yet few studies have directly examined the influence of
   abiotic factors on intraspecific variation in sponge microbial community
   structure. The contrast between intertidal and subtidal environments is
   an ideal system to assess the effect of environmental variation on
   sponge-microbe symbioses, producing two drastically different
   environments on a small spatial scale. Here, we characterized the
   microbial communities of individual intertidal and subtidal Hymeniacidon
   heliophila sponges, ambient seawater, and sediment from a North Carolina
   oyster reef habitat by partial (Illumina sequencing) and nearly
   full-length (clone libraries) 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. Clone
   library sequences were compared to H. heliophila symbiont communities
   from the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, revealing strong host specificity of
   dominant symbiont taxa across expansive geographic distances. Sediment
   and seawater samples yielded clearly distinct microbial communities from
   those found in H. heliophila. Despite the close proximity of the sponges
   sampled, significant differences between subtidal and intertidal sponges
   in the diversity, structure, and composition of their microbial
   communities were detected. Differences were driven by changes in the
   relative abundance of a few dominant microbial symbiont taxa, as well as
   the presence or absence of numerous rare microbial taxa. These findings
   suggest that extreme abiotic fluctuations, such as periodic air exposure
   in intertidal habitats, can drive intraspecific differences in complex
   host-microbe symbioses.

AB Bathymetric biodiversity patterns of marine benthic invertebrates and
   demersal fishes have been identified in the extant fauna of the deep
   continental margins. Depth zonation is widespread and evident through a
   transition between shelf and slope fauna from the shelf break to 1000m,
   and a transition between slope and abyssal fauna from 2000 to 3000m;
   these transitions are characterised by high species turnover. A unimodal
   pattern of diversity with depth peaks between 1000 and 3000m, despite
   the relatively low area represented by these depths. Zonation is thought
   to result from the colonisation of the deep sea by shallow-water
   organisms following multiple mass extinction events throughout the
   Phanerozoic. The effects of low temperature and high pressure act across
   hierarchical levels of biological organisation and appear sufficient to
   limit the distributions of such shallow-water species. Hydrostatic
   pressures of bathyal depths have consistently been identified
   experimentally as the maximum tolerated by shallow-water and upper
   bathyal benthic invertebrates at in situ temperatures, and adaptation
   appears required for passage to deeper water in both benthic
   invertebrates and demersal fishes. Together, this suggests that a
   hyperbaric and thermal physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths
   contributes to bathymetric zonation. The peak of the unimodal
   diversity-depth pattern typically occurs at these depths even though the
   area represented by these depths is relatively low. Although it is
   recognised that, over long evolutionary time scales, shallow-water
   diversity patterns are driven by speciation, little consideration has
   been given to the potential implications for species distribution
   patterns with depth. Molecular and morphological evidence indicates that
   cool bathyal waters are the primary site of adaptive radiation in the
   deep sea, and we hypothesise that bathymetric variation in speciation
   rates could drive the unimodal diversity-depth pattern over time.
   Thermal effects on metabolic-rate-dependent mutation and on generation
   times have been proposed to drive differences in speciation rates, which
   result in modern latitudinal biodiversity patterns over time. Clearly,
   this thermal mechanism alone cannot explain bathymetric patterns since
   temperature generally decreases with depth. We hypothesise that
   demonstrated physiological effects of high hydrostatic pressure and low
   temperature at bathyal depths, acting on shallow-water taxa invading the
   deep sea, may invoke a stress-evolution mechanism by increasing
   mutagenic activity in germ cells, by inactivating canalisation during
   embryonic or larval development, by releasing hidden variation or
   mutagenic activity, or by activating or releasing transposable elements
   in larvae or adults. In this scenario, increased variation at a
   physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths results in elevated
   speciation rate. Adaptation that increases tolerance to high hydrostatic
   pressure and low temperature allows colonisation of abyssal depths and
   reduces the stress-evolution response, consequently returning speciation
   of deeper taxa to the background rate. Over time this mechanism could
   contribute to the unimodal diversity-depth pattern.

AB Populations of the same species can experience different responses to
   the environment throughout their distributional range as a result of
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity in habitat conditions. This
   highlights the importance of understanding the processes governing
   species distribution at local scales. However, research on species
   distribution often averages environmental covariates across large
   geographic areas, missing variability in population-environment
   interactions within geographically distinct regions. We used spatially
   explicit models to identify interactions between species and
   environmental, including chlorophyll a (Chla) and sea surface
   temperature (SST), and trophic (prey density) conditions, along with
   processes governing the distribution of two cephalopods with contrasting
   life-histories (octopus and squid) across the western Mediterranean Sea.
   This approach is relevant for cephalopods, since their population
   dynamics are especially sensitive to variations in habitat conditions
   and rarely stable in abundance and location. The regional distributions
   of the two cephalopod species matched two different trophic pathways
   present in the western Mediterranean Sea, associated with the Gulf of
   Lion upwelling and the Ebro river discharges respectively. The effects
   of the studied environmental and trophic conditions were spatially
   variant in both species, with usually stronger effects along their
   distributional boundaries. We identify areas where prey availability
   limited the abundance of cephalopod populations as well as contrasting
   effects of temperature in the warmest regions. Despite distributional
   patterns matching productive areas, a general negative effect of Chla on
   cephalopod densities suggests that competition pressure is common in the
   study area. Additionally, results highlight the importance of trophic
   interactions, beyond other common environmental factors, in shaping the
   distribution of cephalopod populations. Our study presents a valuable
   approach for understanding the spatially variant ecology of cephalopod
   populations, which is important for fisheries and ecosystem management.

AB The broad distribution of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) along the
   Pacific coast of North America makes it difficult for fisheries managers
   to identify regional stocks of this dominant small pelagic species. An
   investigation of morphometric characteristics of otoliths of Pacific
   sardine across most of their range revealed regional differences in
   populations. In a survey of over 2000 otoliths, all ages (with an
   emphasis on age-1 recruits) were compared. Principal components
   analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and a novel method derived
   from regression and residuals calculations, termed perimeter-weight
   profiles (PWPs), revealed otolith similarities and differences. The
   results of the different approaches to statistical comparisons did not
   always agree. Sardine otoliths from Mexican waters were generally
   lighter and more lobate than those from U.S. and Canadian populations.
   Age-1 otoliths from northern California in 2006-07 tended to be heavier
   and smoother than those from other areas, including year-class cohorts
   from southern California. Comparisons of age-groups and year-classes of
   northern California otoliths with the use of the PWP models indicated
   significant trends in year-to-year patterns. In conjunction with other
   established indices of population structure, otolith PWPs are a useful
   tool for identifying local and regional stocks of Pacific sardine and
   may help distinguish populations of other fish species as well.

AB Life on earth spans a size range of around 21 orders of magnitude across
   species and can span a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude within
   species of animal. The effect of size on physiology is, therefore,
   enormous and is typically expressed by how physiological phenomena scale
   with mass(b). When b not equal 1 a trait does not vary in direct
   proportion to mass and is said to scale allometrically. The study of
   allometric scaling goes back to at least the time of Galileo Galilei,
   and published scaling relationships are now available for hundreds of
   traits. Here, the methods of scaling analysis are reviewed, using
   examples for a range of traits with an emphasis on those related to
   metabolism in animals. Where necessary, new relationships have been
   generated from published data using modern phylogenetically informed
   techniques. During recent decades one of the most controversial scaling
   relationships has been that between metabolic rate and body mass and a
   number of explanations have been proposed for the scaling of this trait.
   Examples of these mechanistic explanations for metabolic scaling are
   reviewed, and suggestions made for comparing between them. Finally, the
   conceptual links between metabolic scaling and ecological patterns are
   examined, emphasizing the distinction between (1) the hypothesis that
   size-and temperature-dependent variation among species and individuals
   in metabolic rate influences ecological processes at levels of
   organization from individuals to the biosphere and (2) mechanistic
   explanations for metabolic rate that may explain the size-and
   temperature-dependence of this trait. (C) 2014 American Physiological

AB Cold stress is a major abiotic factor plants face during their life
   cycle. Although plants often exhibit phenotypic variation in cold
   tolerance, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In the
   present study, the 50% lethal temperature (LT50) values of 37
   Arabidopsis thaliana accessions at latitudes from 15 degrees to 58
   degrees ranged from -13.2 degrees C to -4.9 degrees C and were closely
   correlated with the cold climates of the collection sites. According to
   a methylation analysis of all C-repeat (CRT)-binding factor (CBF)
   pathway genes, the coding and promoter regions of AtICE1, a regulator of
   CBF genes, exhibited the greatest variability in methylation levels
   among the accessions and included 5-122 methylated cytosine residues. In
   contrast, unmethylated or only slightly methylated genes in the CBF
   pathway showed little variation among the accessions. According to a
   gene expression analysis of four selected A. thaliana populations with
   distinct methylation patterns, except for the down-regulated gene
   AtCBF2, the expression levels of all members of the CBF pathway were
   negatively correlated with AtICE1 gene methylation levels. Treatment of
   the four A. thaliana populations with the DNA methylation inhibitory
   reagent 5-azacytidine resulted in a 30.0-78.3% enhancement of freezing
   tolerance and decreases in LT50 values of approximately 1.9-3.6 degrees
   C. Similar effects were observed in drm2 mutants, including 30.0-48.3%
   increases in freezing tolerance and decreases in LT50 values of
   approximately 0.7-3.4 degrees C. Thus, the AtICE1 methylation-regulated
   transcription of CBF pathway genes is responsible for the phenotypic
   variation in the freezing tolerance observed in A. thaliana.

AB Air temperatures estimated by partial thin plate spline interpolation,
   or from the 'nearest station' (Voronoi polygon method), were used to
   model the phenology of three pests of horticultural crops throughout
   England and Wales. Temperatures for a particularly hot (1976) and a
   particularly cold (1986) year were interpolated to a grid resolution of
   1 km. Estimates were made of the timing of spring emergence
   (Cecidophyopsis ribis (Westwood)), the maximum number of generations
   completed during the summer (Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus)) and the
   numbers of days when mating was possible (Merodon equestris
   (Fabricius)). The relative accuracy of the two temperature estimation
   methods was compared using jack-knife cross-validation. For C. ribis and
   P. xylostella, modelling with interpolated temperature input data was
   more accurate than using data from the 'nearest station'. Of the three
   phenology models used, the one that relied on an activity threshold (M.
   equestris) was the most sensitive to both types of input data. Spatial
   variability in the activity of M. equestris adults was investigated in
   the two main areas (south-west peninsula and Lincolnshire) where its
   host crop (Narcissus) is grown. Modelling at cruder scales (up to 25*25
   km) masked local variation, but the degree to which this was important
   varied from region to region and over time, as did the geography of the
   variability itself. The results indicate that interpolated data,
   computed to a resolution of 1 km using the UK synoptic network, have the
   potential for wider use within agricultural decision support systems for
   horticultural crops.

AB Because of its catalytic inefficiencies, Rubisco is the most obvious
   target for improvement to enhance the photosynthetic capacity of plants.
   Two hypotheses are tested in the present work: (1) existing Rubiscos
   have optimal kinetic properties to maximize photosynthetic carbon
   assimilation in existing higher plants; (2) current knowledge allows
   proposal of changes to kinetic properties to make Rubiscos more suited
   to changed conditions in chloroplasts that are likely to occur with
   climate change. The catalytic mechanism of Rubisco results in higher
   catalytic rates of carboxylation being associated with decreased
   affinity for CO2, so that selection for different environments involves
   a trade-off between these two properties. The simulations performed in
   this study confirm that the optimality of Rubisco kinetics depends on
   the species and the environmental conditions. In particular,
   environmental drivers affecting the CO2 availability for carboxylation
   (C-c) or directly shifting the photosynthetic limitations between
   Rubisco and RuBP regeneration determine to what extend Rubisco kinetics
   are optimally suited to maximize CO2 assimilation rate. In general,
   modeled values for optimal kinetic reflect the predominant environmental
   conditions currently encountered by the species in the field. Under
   future climatic conditions, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation will be
   limited by RuBP-regeneration, especially in the absence of water stress,
   the largest rise in [CO2] and the lowest increases in temperature. Under
   these conditions, the model predicts that optimal Rubisco should have
   high S-c/o and low K-cat(c). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Interpreting spatial patterns in the abundance of species over time is a
   fundamental cornerstone of ecological research. For many species, this
   type of analysis is hampered by datasets that contain a large proportion
   of zeros, and data that are overdispersed and spatially autocorrelated.
   This is particularly true for insects, for which abundance data can
   fluctuate from zero to many thousands in the space of weeks.
   Increasingly, an understanding of the ways in which environmental
   variation drives spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution,
   abundance and phenology of insects is required for management of pests
   and vector-borne diseases. In this study, we combine the use of
   smoothing techniques and generalised linear mixed models to relate
   environmental drivers to key phenological patterns of two species of
   biting midges, Culicoides pulicaris and C. impunctatus, of which C.
   pulicaris has been implicated in transmission of bluetongue in Europe.
   In so doing, we demonstrate analytical tools for linking the phenology
   of species with key environmental drivers, despite using a relatively
   small dataset containing overdispersed and zero-inflated data. We
   demonstrate the importance of landcover and climatic variables in
   determining the seasonal abundance of these two vector species, and
   highlight the need for more empirical data on the effects of temperature
   and precipitation on the life history traits of palearctic Culicoides

AB Many species appear to be undergoing shifts in phenology, arising from
   climate change. To predict the direction and magnitude of future changes
   requires an understanding of how phenology depends on climatic
   variation. Species show large-scale spatial variation in phenology
   (affected by differentiation among populations) as well as variation in
   phenology from year-to-year at the same site (affected predominantly by
   local plasticity). Teasing apart spatial and temporal variation in
   phenology should allow improved predictions of phenology under climate
   change. This study is the first to quantify large-scale spatial and
   temporal variation in the entire emergence pattern of species, and to
   test the relationships found by predicting future data. We use data from
   up to 33 years of permanent transect records of butterflies in the
   United Kingdom to fit and test models for 15 butterfly species. We use
   generalized additive models to model spatial and temporal variation in
   the distribution of adult butterflies over the season, allowing us to
   capture changes in the timing of emergence peaks, relative sizes of
   peaks and/or number of peaks in a single analysis. We develop these
   models using data for 1973-2000, and then use them to predict
   phenologies from 2001 to 2006. For six of our study species, a model
   with only spatial variation in phenology is the best predictor of the
   future, implying that these species have limited plasticity. For the
   remaining nine species, the best predictions come from a model with both
   spatial and temporal variation in phenology; for four of these, growing
   degree-days have similar effects over space and time, implying high
   levels of plasticity. The results show that statistical phenology models
   can be used to predict phenology shifts in a second time period,
   suggesting that it should be feasible to project phenologies under
   climate change scenarios, at least over modest time scales.

AB Changes in land-use and climate affect the distribution and diversity of
   plant and animal species at different spatiotemporal scales. The extent
   to which species-specific phenotypic plasticity and biotic interactions
   mediate organismal adaptation to changing environments, however, remains
   poorly understood. Woody plant expansion is threatening the extent of
   alpine grasslands worldwide, and evaluating and predicting its effects
   on herbivores is of crucial importance. Here, we explore the impact of
   shrubification on the feeding efficiency of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra
   p. pyrenaica), as well as on the three most abundant coexisting domestic
   ungulate species: cattle, sheep and horses. We use observational diet
   composition from May to October and model different scenarios of
   vegetation availability where shrubland and woodland proliferate at the
   expense of grassland. We then predicted if the four ungulate species
   could efficiently utilize their food landscapes with their current
   dietary specificities measuring their niche breath in each scenario. We
   observed that the wild counterpart, due to a higher trophic plasticity,
   is less disturbed by shrubification compared to livestock, which rely
   primarily on herbaceous plants and will be affected 3.6 times more. Our
   results suggest that mixed feeders, such as chamois, could benefit from
   fallow landscapes, and that mountain farmers are at a growing economic
   risk worldwide due to changing land-use practices and climate
   conditions.

AB Low temperature or cold stress is one of the major constraints of rice
   production and productivity in temperate rice-growing countries and
   high-altitude areas in the tropics. Even though low temperature affects
   the rice plant in all stages of growth, the percent seed set is damaged
   severely by cold and this reduces the yield potential of cultivars
   significantly. In this study, a new source of cold-tolerant line,
   IR66160-121-4-4-2, was used as a donor parent with a cold-sensitive
   cultivar, Geumobyeo, to produce 153 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs)
   for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. QTL analysis with 175
   polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and composite interval
   mapping identified three main-effect QTLs (qPSST-3, qPSST-7, and
   qPSST-9) on chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. The SSR markers RM569, RM1377, and
   RM24545 were linked to the identified QTLs for cold tolerance with
   respect to percent seed set using cold-water (18-19A degrees C)
   irrigation in the field and controlled air temperature (17A degrees C)
   in the greenhouse. The total phenotypic variation for cold tolerance
   contributed by the three QTLs was 27.4%. RILs with high percent seed set
   under cold stress were validated with linked DNA markers and by
   haplotype analysis that revealed the contribution of progenitor genomes
   from the tropical japonica cultivar Jimbrug (Javanica) and temperate
   japonica cultivar Shen-Nung89-366. Three QTLs contributed by the
   cold-tolerant parent were identified which showed additive effect on
   percent seed set under cold treatment. This study demonstrated the
   utility of a new phenotyping method as well as the identification of SSR
   markers associated with QTLs for selection of cold-tolerant genotypes to
   improve temperate rice production.

AB Many taxa are undergoing distribution shifts in response to
   anthropogenic climate change. However, detecting a climate signal in
   mobile species is difficult due to their wide-ranging, patchy
   distributions, often driven by natural climate variability. For example,
   difficulties associated with assessing pelagic fish distributions have
   rendered fisheries management ill-equipped to adapt to the challenges
   posed by climate change, leaving pelagic species and ecosystems
   vulnerable. Here, we demonstrate the value of citizen science data for
   modelling the dynamic habitat suitability of a mobile pelagic predator
   (black marlin, Istiompax indica) within the south-west Pacific Ocean.
   The extensive spatial and temporal coverage of our occurrence data set
   (n=18717), collected at high resolution (similar to 1.85km(2)), enabled
   identification of suitable habitat at monthly time steps over a 16-year
   period (1998-2013). We identified considerable monthly, seasonal and
   interannual variability in the extent and distribution of suitable
   habitat, predominately driven by chlorophyll a and sea surface height.
   Interannual variability correlated with El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) events, with suitable habitat extending up to similar to 300km
   further south during La Nina events. Despite the strong influence of
   ENSO, our model revealed a rapid poleward shift in the geometric mean of
   black marlin habitat, occurring at 88.2kmdecade(-1). By incorporating
   multiple environmental factors at monthly time steps, we were able to
   demonstrate a rapid distribution shift in a mobile pelagic species. Our
   findings suggest that the rapid velocity of climate change in the
   south-west Pacific Ocean is likely affecting mobile pelagic species,
   indicating that they may be more vulnerable to climate change than
   previously thought.

AB In crop species such as wheat, abiotic stresses and preharvest sprouting
   reduce grain yield and quality. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA)
   plays important roles in abiotic stress tolerance and seed dormancy. In
   previous studies, we evaluated ABA responsiveness of 67 Aegilops
   tauschii accessions and their synthetic hexaploid wheat lines, finding
   wide variation that was due to the D-genome. In this study, quantitative
   trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using an F-2 population derived
   from crosses of highly ABA-responsive and less-responsive synthetic
   wheat lines. A significant QTL was detected on chromosome 6D, in a
   similar location to that reported for ABA responsiveness using
   recombinant inbred lines derived from common wheat cultivars
   Mironovskaya 808 and Chinese Spring. A comparative map and physiological
   and expression analyses of the 6D QTL suggested that this locus involved
   in line differences among wheat synthetics is different from that
   involved in cultivar differences in common wheat. The common wheat 6D
   QTL was found to affect seed dormancy and the regulation of
   cold-responsive/late embryogenesis abundant genes during dehydration.
   However, in synthetic wheat, we failed to detect any association of ABA
   responsiveness with abiotic stress tolerance or seed dormancy, at least
   under our experimental conditions. Development of near-isogenic lines
   will be important for functional analyses of the synthetic wheat 6D QTL.

AB A greater understanding of natural variation in photosynthesis will
   inform strategies for crop improvement by revealing overlooked
   opportunities. We use Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes as a model system to
   assess (i) how photosynthesis and photorespiration covary and (ii) how
   mesophyll conductance influences water use efficiency (WUE). Phenotypic
   variation in photorespiratory CO2 efflux was correlated with
   assimilation rates and two metrics of photosynthetic capacity (i.e.
   V(cmax )and J(max)); however, genetic correlations were not detected
   between photosynthesis and photorespiration. We found standing genetic
   variation-as broad-sense heritability-for most photosynthetic traits,
   including photorespiration. Genetic correlation between photosynthetic
   electron transport and carboxylation capacities indicates that these
   traits are genetically constrained. Winter ecotypes had greater
   mesophyll conductance, maximum carboxylation capacity, maximum electron
   transport capacity, and leaf structural robustness when compared with
   spring ecotypes. Stomatal conductance varied little in winter ecotypes,
   leading to a positive correlation between integrated WUE and mesophyll
   conductance. Thus, variation in mesophyll conductance can modulate WUE
   among A. thaliana ecotypes without a significant loss in assimilation.
   Genetic correlations between traits supplying energy and carbon to the
   Calvin-Benson cycle are consistent with biochemical models, suggesting
   that selection on either of these traits would improve all of them.
   Similarly, the lack of a genetic correlation between photosynthesis and
   photorespiration suggests that the positive scaling of these two traits
   can be broken.

AB Isothermal germination curves, sigmoid and nonsigmoid, can be described
   by a variety of models reminiscent of growth models. Two of these, which
   are consistent with the percent of germinated spores being initially
   zero, were selected: one, Weibullian (or "stretched exponential"), for
   more or less symmetric curves, and the other, introduced by Dantigny's
   group, for asymmetric curves (P. Dantigny, S. P.-M. Nanguy, D.
   Judet-Correia, and M. Bensoussan, Int. J. Food Microbiol. 146: 176 -
   181, 2011). These static models were converted into differential rate
   models to simulate dynamic germination patterns, which passed a test for
   consistency. In principle, these and similar models, if validated
   experimentally, could be used to predict dynamic germination from
   isothermal data. The procedures to generate both isothermal and dynamic
   germination curves have been automated and posted as freeware on the
   Internet in the form of interactive Wolfram demonstrations. A fully
   stochastic model of individual and small groups of spores, developed in
   parallel, shows that when the germination probability is constant from
   the start, the germination curve is nonsigmoid. It becomes sigmoid if
   the probability monotonically rises from zero. If the probability rate
   function rises and then falls, the germination reaches an asymptotic
   level determined by the peak's location and height. As the number of
   individual spores rises, the germination curve of their assemblies
   becomes smoother. It also becomes more deterministic and can be
   described by the empirical phenomenological models.

AB Background
   Dengue is the fastest spreading vector-borne viral disease, resulting in
   an estimated 390 million infections annually. Precise prediction of many
   attributes related to dengue is still a challenge due to the complex
   dynamics of the disease. Important attributes to predict include: the
   risk of and risk factors for an infection; infection severity; and the
   timing and magnitude of outbreaks. In this work, we build a model for
   predicting the risk of dengue transmission using high-resolution weather
   data. The level of dengue transmission risk depends on the vector
   density, hence we predict risk via vector prediction.
   Methods and findings
   We make use of surveillance data on Aedes aegypti larvae collected by
   the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control as part of the national routine
   entomological surveillance of dengue, and weather data simulated using
   the IBM's Containerized Forecasting Workflow, a high spatial- and
   temporal-resolution forecasting system. We propose a two stage risk
   prediction system for assessing dengue transmission via Aedes aegypti
   mosquitoes. In stage one, we perform a logistic regression to determine
   whether larvae are present or absent at the locations of interest using
   weather attributes as the explanatory variables. The results are then
   aggregated to an administrative division, with presence in the division
   determined by a threshold percentage of larvae positive locations
   resulting from a bootstrap approach. In stage two, larvae counts are
   estimated for the predicted larvae positive divisions from stage one,
   using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. This model identifies the
   larvae positive locations with 71% accuracy and predicts the larvae
   numbers producing a coverage probability of 98% over 95% nominal
   prediction intervals. This two-stage model improves the overall accuracy
   of identifying larvae positive locations by 29%, and the mean squared
   error of predicted larvae numbers by 9.6%, against a single-stage
   approach which uses a zero-inflated binomial regression approach.
   Conclusions
   We demonstrate a risk prediction system using high resolution weather
   data can provide valuable insight to the distribution of risk over a
   geographical region. The work also shows that a two-stage approach is
   beneficial in predicting risk in non-homogeneous regions, where the risk
   is localised.

AB Fisherian sex-ratio theory predicts sexual species should have a
   balanced primary sex ratio. However, organisms with environmental sex
   determination (ESD) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing skewed
   sex ratios when environmental conditions vary. Theoretical work has
   modeled sex-ratio dynamics for animals with ESD with regard to 2 traits
   predicted to be responsive to sex-ratio selection: 1) maternal
   oviposition behavior and 2) sensitivity of embryonic sex determination
   to environmental conditions, and much research has since focused on how
   these traits influence offspring sex ratios. However, relatively few
   studies have provided estimates of univariate quantitative genetic
   parameters for these 2 traits, and the existence of phenotypic or
   genetic covariances among these traits has not been assessed. Here, we
   leverage studies on 3 species of reptiles (2 turtle species and a
   lizard) with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) to assess
   phenotypic covariances between measures of maternal oviposition behavior
   and thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway. These studies
   quantified maternal behaviors that relate to nest temperature and sex
   ratio of offspring incubated under controlled conditions. A positive
   covariance between these traits would enhance the efficiency of
   sex-ratio selection when primary sex ratio is unbalanced. However, we
   detected no such covariance between measures of these categories of
   traits in the 3 study species. These results suggest that maternal
   oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of sex determination in
   embryos might evolve independently. Such information is critical to
   understand how animals with TSD will respond to rapidly changing
   environments that induce sex-ratio selection.

   (thorax length, wing length, wing width, wing/thorax ratio and
   wing-aspect ratio) was studied at three developmental temperatures (20,
   25 and 30 degreesC) in Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila simulans
   collected on the island of La Gomera (Canary Archipelago). The flies
   originated from five closely situated localities, representing different
   altitudes (from 20 to 886 m above sea level) and a range of climatic
   conditions. We found statistically significant population effects for
   all traits in D. buzzatii and for most of the traits in D. simulans.
   Although no correlations of trait values with altitude were detected,
   geographical patterns for three life-history traits and body size in D.
   buzzatii indicated that short-range geographical variation in this
   species could be maintained by local climatic selection. Five of eight
   traits showed population-by-temperature interactions either in D.
   buzzatii or in D. simulans, but in all cases except wing width in D.
   buzzatii this could not be interpreted as adaptive responses to thermal
   conditions in the localities. The range of plastic changes across
   temperatures for particular traits differed between species, indicating
   a possibility for different levels of environmental stress experienced
   by the natural populations. The reaction norm curves and the response of
   within-population variability to thermal treatments suggested better
   adaptations to higher and lower temperatures for D. buzzatii and D.
   simulans, respectively. The levels of among-population differentiation
   depended on developmental temperature, implying environmental effects on
   the expression of the genetic variance. At 20 and 25 degreesC,
   interpopulation variability in D. buzzatii was higher than in D.
   simulans, while at 30 degreesC the opposite trend was observed. (C) 2005

AB 1. Experimental growth data for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.),
   all fed on excess rations, from 11 European watercourses between 54 and
   70degreesN were analysed and fitted to a new general growth model for
   fish. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with the
   growth rate of charr in the wild.
   2. Growth performance varied among populations, mainly because of
   variation in the maximum growth potential, whereas the thermal response
   curves were similar. The estimated lower and upper temperatures for
   growth varied between -1.7 to 5.3 and 20.8-23.2degreesC, respectively,
   while maximum growth occurred between 14.4 and 17.2degreesC.
   3. There was no geographical or climatic trend in growth performance
   among populations and therefore no indication of thermal adaptation. The
   growth potential of charr from different populations correlated
   positively with fish body length at maturity and maximum weight in the
   wild. Charr from populations including large piscivorous fish had higher
   growth rates under standardised conditions than those from populations
   feeding on zoobenthos or zooplankton. Therefore, the adaptive variation
   in growth potential was related to life-history characteristics and
   diet, rather than to thermal conditions.

AB Using a revised chronology, a new palynological study on the late
   Pliocene (Piacenzian and earliest Gelasian) Rio Maior site of the Tagus
   Basin in western Portugal has been undertaken from the F98 core.
   Combining light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, a total of
   127 different pollen and spore taxa have been identified from the
   Piacenzian Lake and indicate the presence of a subtropical to
   warm-temperate mixed forest during the majority of the Piacenzian
   (3.6-2.8 Ma). It is only in the latest Piacenzian (after 2.8 Ma) that
   progressive extinctions of climate sensitive taxa and a drop in
   diversity indicate a cooling and drying climate trend that has also been
   recorded from high-latitude localities. By the earliest Gelasian (2.58
   Ma), a low diversity Ericaceae and Pinus dominated vegetation remained.
   The Piacenzian flora of Rio Maior also shows fluctuations in the
   presence of climate sensitive taxa and pollen-spore diversity that may
   be related to Piacenzian glaciations.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.) is particularly sensitive to chilling in the early
   growth stages. The objective of this study was to determine quantitative
   trait loci (QTL) for early plant vigour of maize grown under cool and
   moderately warm conditions in Central Europe. A population of 720
   doubled haploid (DH) lines was derived from a cross between two dent
   inbred lines contrasting in early vigour and were genotyped with 188 SSR
   markers. The DH lines per se and their testcrosses with a flint line
   were evaluated in field experiments across 11 environments in 2001 and
   2002. Plants were harvested after six to eight leaves had been fully
   developed to assess fresh matter yield as a criterion of early vigour.
   Seven QTL were detected for line performance and ten QTL for testcross
   performance, explaining 64 and 49% of the genetic variance. Six out of
   seven QTL detected in the lines per se were also significant in their
   testcrosses. Significant QTL x environment interaction was observed, but
   no relationship existed between the size of the QTL effects and the mean
   temperature in the individual environment. The correlation between fresh
   matter yield and days to silking was non-significant, indicating that
   differences in early plant vigour were not simply caused by maturity
   differences. For three additional chilling-related traits, leaf
   chlorosis, leaf purpling, and frost damage seven, six, and five QTL were
   detected, respectively. Three QTL for leaf chlorosis, two for leaf
   purpling, and two for frost damage co-localized with QTL for fresh
   matter yield. Results are considered as a reliable basis for further
   genetic, molecular, and physiological investigations.

AB The force exerted by skeletal muscle is modulated by compliance of
   tissues to which it is connected. Force of the muscle sarcomere is
   modulated by compliance of the myofilaments. We tested the hypothesis
   that myofilament compliance influences Ca2+ regulation of muscle by
   constructing a computational model of the muscle half sarcomere that
   includes compliance of the filaments as a variable. The biomechanical
   model consists of three half-filaments of myosin and 13 thin filaments.
   Initial spacing of motor domains of myosin on thick filaments and
   myosin-binding sites on thin filaments was taken to be that measured
   experimentally in unstrained filaments. Monte-Carlo simulations were
   used to determine transitions around a three-state cycle for each
   cross-bridge and between two-states for each thin filament regulatory
   unit. This multifilament model exhibited less "tuning" of maximum force
   than an earlier two-filament model. Significantly, both the apparent
   Ca2+-sensitivity and cooperativity of activation of steady-state
   isometric force were modulated by myofilament compliance.
   Activation-dependence of the kinetics of tension development was also
   modulated by filament compliance. Tuning in the full myofilament lattice
   appears to be more significant at submaximal levels of thin filament
   activation.

AB Developmental resource partitioning and the consequent offspring size
   variations are of fundamental importance for marine invertebrates, in
   both an ecological and evolutionary context. Typically, differences are
   attributed to maternal investment and the environmental factors
   determining this; additional variables, such as environmental factors
   affecting development, are rarely discussed. During intracapsular
   development, for example, sibling conflict has the potential to affect
   resource partitioning. Here, we investigate encapsulated development in
   the marine gastropod Buccinum undatum. We examine the effects of
   maternal investment and temperature on intracapsular resource
   partitioning in this species. Reproductive output was positively
   influenced by maternal investment, but additionally, temperature and
   sibling conflict significantly affected offspring size, number, and
   quality during development. Increased temperature led to reduced
   offspring number, and a combination of high sibling competition and
   asynchronous early development resulted in a common occurrence of empty
   embryos, which received no nutrition at all. The proportion of empty
   embryos increased with both temperature and capsule size. Additionally,
   a novel example of a risk in sibling conflict was observed; embryos
   cannibalized by others during early development ingested nurse eggs from
   inside the consumer, killing it in a Trojan horse scenario. Our results
   highlight the complexity surrounding offspring fitness. Encapsulation
   should be considered as significant in determining maternal output.
   Considering predicted increases in ocean temperatures, this may impact
   offspring quality and consequently species distribution and abundance.

AB We artificially selected on egg size in a butterfly to study the
   consequences for fecundity, reproductive effort and offspring fitness.
   Correlated responses in either pupal mass, larval or pupal development
   time were virtually absent. Offspring size was positively related to
   fitness, but only partly traded off against fecundity. Rather, total
   reproductive effort (measured as fresh mass), egg water content and the
   decline of egg size with female age increased in the large-egg selected
   lines compared to either small-egg or control lines. Accounting for
   these effects showed that reproductive investment (in dry mass) was in
   fact similar across lines. Such mechanisms may enable increased
   investment in (early) offspring without a reduction in their number,
   revealing a much more complex picture than a simple trade-off between
   offspring size and number. Substantial variation among replicates
   suggests that there are different underlying mechanisms for change,
   rather than any single, unitary pathway.

   CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, chloroplast CO2 concentration
   and the carbon isotope composition of carbohydrate formed during
   photosynthesis separately for sunlit and shaded leaves within multiple
   canopy layers. The ecosystem photosynthesis model was validated by
   comparison to leaf-level gas exchange measurements and estimates of
   ecosystem-scale photosynthesis from eddy covariance measurements made in
   a coastal Douglas-fir forest on Vancouver Island. A good agreement was
   also observed between modelled and measured delta C-13 values of
   ecosystem-respired CO2 (delta(R)). The modelled delta(R) values showed
   strong responses to variation in photosynthetic photon flux density
   (PPFD), air temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and available
   soil moisture in a manner consistent with leaf-level studies of
   photosynthetic C-13 discrimination. Sensitivity tests were conducted to
   evaluate the effect of (1) changes in the lag between the time of CO2
   fixation and the conversion of organic matter back to CO2; (2) shifts in
   the proportion of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration; (3) isotope
   fractionation during respiration; and (4) environmentally induced
   changes in mesophyll conductance, on modelled delta(R) values. Our
   results indicated that delta(R) is a good proxy for canopy-level C-c/C-a
   and C-13 discrimination during photosynthetic gas exchange, and
   therefore has several applications in ecosystem physiology.

AB In modular organisms, the propagation of genetic variability within a
   clonal unit can alter the scale at which ecological and evolutionary
   processes operate. Genetic variation within an individual primarily
   arises through the accretion of somatic mutations over time, leading to
   genetic mosaicism. Here, we assess the prevalence of intraorganismal
   genetic variation and potential mechanisms influencing the degree of
   genetic mosaicism in the reef corals Orbicella franksi and Orbicella
   annularis. Colonies of both species, encompassing a range of coral sizes
   and depths, were sampled multiple times and genotyped at the same
   microsatellite loci to detect intraorganismal genetic variation. Genetic
   mosaicism was detected in 38% of corals evaluated, and mutation
   frequency was found to be positively related with clonal size and
   negatively associated with coral depth. We suggest that larger clones
   experience a greater number of somatic cell divisions and consequently
   have an elevated potential to accumulate mutations. Furthermore, corals
   at shallower depths may be exposed to abiotic conditions such as
   elevated thermal regimes, which promote increased mutation rates. The
   results highlight the pervasiveness of intraorganismal genetic variation
   in reef-building corals and emphasize potential mechanisms generating
   somatic mutations in modular organisms.

AB As global temperatures rise, there is a growing need to understand the
   physiological mechanisms that determine an organism's thermal niche.
   Here, we test the hypothesis that increases in mitochondrial capacity
   with cold acclimation and adaptation are associated with decreases in
   thermal tolerance using two subspecies of killifish (Fundulus
   heteroclitus) that differ in thermal niche. We assessed whole-organism
   metabolic rate, mitochondrial amount and mitochondrial function in
   killifish acclimated to several temperatures. Mitochondrial enzyme
   activities and mRNA levels were greater in fish from the northern
   subspecies, particularly in cold-acclimated fish, suggesting that the
   putatively cold-adapted northern subspecies has a greater capacity for
   increases in mitochondrial amount in response to cold acclimation. When
   tested at the fish's acclimation temperature, maximum ADP-stimulated
   (State III) rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vitro were
   greater in cold-acclimated northern fish than in southern fish but did
   not differ between subspecies at higher acclimation temperatures.
   Whole-organism metabolic rate was greater in fish of the northern
   subspecies at all acclimation temperatures. Cold acclimation also
   changed the response of mitochondrial respiration to acute temperature
   challenge. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was greater in
   cold-acclimated northern fish than in southern fish at low test
   temperatures, but the opposite was true at high test temperatures. These
   differences were reflected in whole-organism oxygen consumption. Our
   data indicate that the plasticity of mitochondrial function and amount
   differs between killifish subspecies, with the less high-temperature
   tolerant, and putatively cold adapted, northern subspecies having
   greater ability to increase mitochondrial capacity in the cold. However,
   there were few differences in mitochondrial properties between
   subspecies at warm acclimation temperatures, despite differences in both
   whole-organism oxygen consumption and thermal tolerance at these
   temperatures.

AB Understanding the relationships between environmental variables and
   wildlife activity is an important part of effective management. The
   desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), an imperiled species of arid
   environments in the southwest US, may have increasingly restricted
   windows for activity due to current warming trends. In summer 2013, we
   deployed 48 motion sensor cameras at the entrances of tortoise burrows
   to investigate the effects of temperature, sex, and day of the year on
   the activity of desert tortoises. Using generalized estimating
   equations, we found that the relative probability of activity was
   associated with temperature (linear and quadratic), sex, and day of the
   year. Sex effects showed that male tortoises are generally more active
   than female tortoises. Temperature had a quadratic effect, indicating
   that tortoise activity was heightened at a range of temperatures. In
   addition, we found significant support for interactions between sex and
   day of the year, and sex and temperature as predictors of the
   probability of activity. Using our models, we were able to estimate air
   temperatures and times (days and hours) that were associated with
   maximum activity during the study. Because tortoise activity is
   constrained by environmental conditions such as temperature, it is
   increasingly vital to conduct studies on how tortoises vary their
   activity throughout the Sonoran Desert to better understand the effects
   of a changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB East African climate change since the Late Miocene consisted of
   persistent shorter-term, orbital-scale wet-dry cycles superimposed upon
   a long-term trend towards more open, grassy landscapes. Either or both
   of these modes of palaeoclimate variability may have influenced East
   African mammalian evolution, yet the interrelationship between these
   secular and orbital palaeoclimate signals remains poorly understood.
   Here, we explore whether the long-term secular climate change was also
   accompanied by significant changes at the orbital-scale. We develop
   northeast African hydroclimate and vegetation proxy data for two 100
   kyr-duration windows near 3.05 and 1.75 Ma at ODP Site 967 in the
   eastern Mediterranean basin, where sedimentation is dominated by eastern
   Sahara dust input and Nile River run-off. These two windows were
   selected because they have comparable orbital configurations and bracket
   an important increase in East African C-4 grasslands. We conducted
   high-resolution (2.5 kyr sampling) multiproxy biomarker, H- and
   C-isotopic analyses of plant waxes and lignin phenols to document
   orbital-scale changes in hydrology, vegetation and woody cover for these
   two intervals. Both intervals are dominated by large-amplitude,
   precession-scale (approx. 20 kyr) changes in northeast African
   vegetation and rainfall/run-off. The delta C-13(wax) values and lignin
   phenol composition record a variable but consistently C-4
   grass-dominated ecosystem for both intervals (50-80% C-4). Precessional
   delta D-wax cycles were approximately 20-30% in peak-to-peak amplitude,
   comparable with other delta D-wax records of the Early Holocene African
   Humid Period. There were no significant differences in the means or
   variances of the delta D-wax or delta C-13(wax) data for the 3.05 and
   1.75 Ma intervals studied, suggesting that the palaeohydrology and
   palaeovegetation responses to precessional forcing were similar for
   these two periods. Data for these two windows suggest that the eastern
   Sahara did not experience the significant increase in C-4 vegetation
   that has been observed in East Africa over this time period. This
   observation would be consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby East
   African precipitation is reduced, and drier conditions established, in
   response to the emergence of modern zonal sea surface temperature
   gradients in the tropical oceans between 3 and 2 Ma.

AB This is the first of three papers analyzing the representation of
   information in the biosphere, and the energetic constraints limiting the
   imposition or maintenance of that information. Biological information is
   inherently a chemical property, but is equally an aspect of control flow
   and a result of processes equivalent to computation. The current paper
   develops the constraints on a theory of biological information capable
   of incorporating these three characterizations and their quantitative
   consequences. The paper illustrates the need for a theory linking energy
   and information by considering the problem of existence and reslience of
   the biosphere, and presents empirical evidence from growth and
   development at the organismal level suggesting that the theory developed
   will capture relevant constraints on real systems. The main result of
   the paper is that the limits on the minimal energetic cost of
   information flow will be tractable and universal whereas the assembly of
   more literal process models into a system-level description often is
   not. The second paper in the series then goes on to construct reversible
   models of energy and information flow in chemistry which achieve the
   idealized limits, and the third paper relates these to fundamental
   operations of computation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Proliferation of East Antarctic Adelie penguins in response to

AB Background: Major, long-term environmental changes are projected in the
   Southern Ocean and these are likely to have impacts for marine predators
   such as the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Decadal monitoring
   studies have provided insight into the short-term environmental
   sensitivities of Adelie penguin populations, particularly to sea ice
   changes. However, given the long-term nature of projected climate
   change, it is also prudent to consider the responses of populations to
   environmental change over longer time scales. We investigated the
   population trajectory of Adelie penguins during the last
   glacial-interglacial transition to determine how the species was
   affected by climate warming over millennia. We focussed our study on
   East Antarctica, which is home to 30 % of the global population of
   Adelie penguins.
   Methods: Using mitochondrial DNA from extant colonies, we reconstructed
   the population trend of Adelie penguins in East Antarctica over the past
   22,000 years using an extended Bayesian skyline plot method. To
   determine the relationship of East Antarctic Adelie penguins with
   populations elsewhere in Antarctica we constructed a phylogeny using
   mitochondrial DNA sequences.
   Results: We found that the Adelie penguin population expanded 135-fold
   from approximately 14,000 years ago. The population growth was
   coincident with deglaciation in East Antarctica and, therefore, an
   increase in ice-free ground suitable for Adelie penguin nesting. Our
   phylogenetic analysis indicated that East Antarctic Adelie penguins
   share a common ancestor with Adelie penguins from the Antarctic
   Peninsula and Scotia Arc, with an estimated age of 29,000 years ago, in
   the midst of the last glacial period. This finding suggests that extant
   colonies in East Antarctica, the Scotia Arc and the Antarctic Peninsula
   were founded from a single glacial refuge.
   Conclusions: While changes in sea ice conditions are a critical driver
   of Adelie penguin population success over decadal and yearly timescales,
   deglaciation appears to have been the key driver of population change
   over millennia. This suggests that environmental drivers of population
   trends over thousands of years may differ to drivers over years or
   decades, highlighting the need to consider millennial-scale trends
   alongside contemporary data for the forecasting of species' abundance
   and distribution changes under future climate change scenarios.

AB Genetic improvement of agronomic crops is necessary to cope with
   chilling stress. To identify the physiological factors responsible for
   this genotypic difference in chill-induced inhibition of photosynthesis,
   leaf CO2 assimilation, the electron flux in the chloroplast and the
   antioxidant metabolism in isolated chloroplasts were examined in two
   genotypes of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants with distinct chilling
   tolerance. Cucumber plants were exposed to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 9/7
   degrees C (day/night) for 10 d and were then returned to optimal
   conditions for 2 d. Chilling resulted in more significant reductions in
   rbcL and rbcS transcripts, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) content and initial Rubisco activity,
   leading to higher electron flux to O-2 in the chilling-sensitive
   genotype than in the chilling-tolerant genotype. The chilling-tolerant
   genotype showed lower H2O2 contents in the chloroplasts by maintaining
   higher H2O2-scavenging activity in the chloroplasts than in the
   chilling-sensitive genotype. H2O2 accumulation in chloroplast was
   negatively correlated with the initial Rubisco activity and
   photosynthetic rate.

AB The performance of fermentation processes is greatly influenced by the
   size and quality of inocula. The characterization of the replicative age
   is decided by the number of birth scars each yeast exhibits on its
   cellular membrane. Yeast ageing and inoculum size are factors that
   affect industrial fermentation, particularly those processes in which
   the yeast cells are reused such as the production of beer. This process
   reuses yeast cropped at the end of one fermentation in the following
   one, in a process called "serial repitching". The aim of this study was
   to explore the effects of inoculum size and ageing on the first stages
   of the dynamics of yeast population growth. However, only
   Individual-based Models (IbMs) allow the study of small,
   well-characterized, microbial inocula. We used INDISIM-YEAST, based on
   the generic IbM simulator INDISIM, to carry out these studies. Several
   simulations were performed to analyze the effect of the inoculum size
   and genealogical age of the cells that made it up on the lag phase,
   first division time and specific growth rate. The shortest lag phase and
   time to the first division were obtained with largest inocula and with
   the youngest inoculated parent cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Local climate is an important source of selection on thermal reaction
   norms that has been well investigated in cline studies, where
   populations sampled along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients are
   compared. Several biotic factors vary with climate, but are rarely
   integrated as alternative agents of selection to climatic factors. We
   tested the hypothesis that habitat may select for thermal reaction norms
   and magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in a drosophila parasitoid,
   independently of the climate of origin. We sampled populations of
   Leptopilina boulardi, a Drosophila parasitoid in two different habitats,
   orchards and forests. Orchards offer laying opportunities over small
   distances for parasitoids, with a low variability in the number of hosts
   per patch, while forests offer more dispersed and more variable patches.
   The sampling was realized in a temperate and a Mediterranean climate. We
   measured egg load, volume of eggs, longevity and lipid content for
   parasitoids reared at two temperatures. Reaction norms were opposite for
   populations from forests and orchards for investment in reproduction,
   independently of the climate of origin. The maximal investment of
   resources in reproduction occurred at the lower temperature in orchards
   and the higher temperature in forests. Host distribution differences
   between habitats may explain these opposite reaction norms. We also
   observed a flatter reaction norm for egg load in forests than in
   orchards. This relative canalization may have been selected in response
   to the higher variability in laying opportunities observed in forests.
   Our results demonstrate the potential role of resource distribution in
   evolution of thermal plasticity.

AB Phenotypic plasticity may be an important initial mechanism to counter
   environmental change, yet we know relatively little about the evolution
   of plasticity in nature. Species with widespread distributions are
   expected to have evolved higher levels of plasticity compared with those
   with more restricted, tropical distributions. At the intraspecific
   level, temperate populations are expected to have evolved higher levels
   of plasticity than their tropical counterparts. However, empirical
   support for these expectations is limited. In addition, no studies have
   comprehensively examined the evolution of thermal plasticity across life
   stages. Using populations of Drosophila simulans collected from a
   latitudinal cline spanning the entire east coast of Australia, we
   assessed thermal plasticity, measured as hardening capacity (the
   difference between basal and hardened thermal tolerance) for multiple
   measures of heat and cold tolerance across both adult and larval stages
   of development. This allowed us to explicitly ask whether the evolution
   of thermal plasticity is favoured in more variable, temperate
   environments. We found no relationship between thermal plasticity and
   latitude, providing little support for the hypothesis that temperate
   populations have evolved higher levels of thermal plasticity than their
   tropical counterparts. With the exception of adult heat survival, we
   also found no association between plasticity and ten climatic variables,
   indicating that the evolution of thermal plasticity is not easily
   predicted by the type of environment that a particular population
   occupies. We discuss these results in the context of the role of
   plasticity in a warming climate.

AB Phase estimation of the human circadian rhythm is a topic that has been
   explored using various modeling approaches. The current models range
   from physiological to mathematical, all attempting to estimate the
   circadian phase from different physiological or behavioral signals.
   Here, we have focused on estimation of the circadian phase from
   unobtrusively collected signals in ambulatory conditions using a
   statistically trained autoregressive moving average with exogenous
   inputs (ARMAX) model. Special attention has been given to the evaluation
   of heart rate interbeat intervals (RR intervals) as a potential
   circadian phase predictor. Prediction models were trained using all
   possible combinations of RR intervals, activity levels, and light
   exposures, each collected over a period of 24 hours. The signals were
   measured without any behavioral constraints, aside from the collection
   of saliva in the evening to determine melatonin concentration, which was
   measured in dim-light conditions. The model was trained and evaluated
   using 2 completely independent datasets, with 11 and 19 participants,
   respectively. The output was compared to the gold standard of circadian
   phase: dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO). The most accurate model that we
   found made use of RR intervals and light and was able to yield phase
   estimates with a prediction error of 2 +/- 39 minutes (mean +/- SD) from
   the DLMO reference value.

AB Predicting how climate change will affect disease dynamics requires an
   understanding of how the environment affects host-pathogen interactions.
   For amphibians, global declines and extinctions have been linked to a
   pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Using a
   combination of body temperature measurements and disease assays
   conducted before and after the arrival of B. dendrobatidis, this study
   tested the hypothesis that body temperature affects the prevalence of
   infection in a wild population of Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus
   zeteki). The timing of first detection of the fungus was consistent with
   that of a wave of epidemic infections spreading south and eastward
   through Central America. During the epidemic, many golden frogs modified
   their thermoregulatory behaviour, raising body temperatures above their
   normal set point. Odds of infection decreased with increasing body
   temperature, demonstrating that even slight environmental or behavioural
   changes have the potential to affect an individual's vulnerability to
   infection. The thermal dependency of the relationship between B.
   dendrobatidis and its amphibian hosts demonstrates how the progression
   of an epidemic can be influenced by complex interactions between host
   and pathogen phenotypes and the environments in which they are found.

AB The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is an offshore-spawning
   estuarine-dependent fish that is abundant along the east coast of North
   America. Young-of-the-year bluefish undergo a habitat shift from
   offshore waters to inshore nursery areas at about 40-70 mm total length
   which coincides with an increased growth rate and a diet shift from
   planktivory to piscivory. Here, we measure growth of young-of-the-year
   bluefish on different diets and estimate consumption rates both in the
   field and in the laboratory. Growth on a fish diet is significantly
   higher than that on a zooplanktivorous diet. Bluefish have among the
   highest evacuation (5-7 h), consumption (20-30% body weight/d), and
   specific growth rates (1-2 mm/d) reported for temperate fishes and are
   similar to those for pelagic tropical species. These results suggest
   that bluefish may exhibit a tropical feeding physiology in temperate
   estuarine nurseries as a way to achieve rapid growth rates.

AB Phytoplankton abundance is inversely related to sea surface temperature
   (SST). However, a positive relationship is observed between SST and
   phytoplankton abundance in coastal waters of Bay of Bengal. This has led
   to an assertion that in a warming climate, rise in SST may increase
   phytoplankton blooms and, therefore, cholera outbreaks. Here, we explain
   why a positive SST-phytoplankton relationship exists in the Bay of
   Bengal and the implications of such a relationship on cholera dynamics.
   We found clear evidence of two independent physical drivers for
   phytoplankton abundance. The first one is the widely accepted
   phytoplankton blooming produced by the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich
   deep ocean waters. The second, which explains the Bay of Bengal
   findings, is coastal phytoplankton blooming during high river discharges
   with terrestrial nutrients. Causal mechanisms should be understood when
   associating SST with phytoplankton and subsequent cholera outbreaks in
   regions where freshwater discharge are a predominant mechanism for
   phytoplankton production.

AB Shape variation of individuals from three locations, two from Argentina
   and one from Brazil, was analysed by geometric morphometrics techniques.
   Individuals were weighed, measured, sexed, assigned to a maturity stage
   and photographed. For the analysis, two landmark configurations were
   used: one of nine landmarks (9L) and another of 25 landmarks (25L). To
   visualise shape variation, a principal component analysis (PCA) on
   Procrustes coordinates was conducted. The percentage of total shape
   variation explained by the 9L configuration was 80.5% (PC1: 61% and PC2:
   19.5%), while the percentage for the 25L configuration was 76.4% (PC1:
   54.8% and PC2: 21.6%). Based on this, shape analyses were performed
   using only the 9L configuration. The PCA results indicated that
   specimens show a large overlap between the categories based on sex and
   maturity stage. When location is considered, squid shape from So
   Sebastio and Rawson Port were very similar, while in Nuevo Gulf, the
   presence of two different morphological groups were observed: one
   similar to So Sebastio and Rawson Port, and the other with a morphology
   typical of Nuevo Gulf. Thus, two different morphotypes were defined: (i)
   morphotype of the continental shelf and (ii) morphotype typical of the
   gulf. The continental shelf morphotype is characterised by larger fins
   and wider mantle than the gulf morphotype. These results suggest that
   the morphotypes of Doryteuthis sanpaulensis are adaptations to
   oceanographic regimens.

AB The tropical ocean environment is changing at an unprecedented rate,
   with warming and severe tropical cyclones creating obvious impacts to
   coral reefs within the last few decades and projections of acidification
   raising concerns for the future of these iconic and economically
   important ecosystems. Documenting variability and detecting change in
   global and regional climate relies upon high-quality observational
   records of climate variables supplemented, prior to the mid-19th
   century, with reconstructions from various sources of proxy climate
   information. Here we review how annual density banding patterns that are
   recorded in the skeletons of massive reef-building corals have been used
   to document environmental change and impacts within coral reefs. Massive
   corals provide a historical perspective of continuous calcification
   processes that pre-date most ecological observations of coral reefs.
   High-density stress bands, abrupt declines in annual linear extension,
   and evidence of partial mortality within the skeletal growth record
   reveal signatures of catastrophic stress events that have recently been
   attributed to mass bleaching events caused by unprecedented thermal
   stress. Comparison of recent trends in annual calcification with
   century-scale baseline calcification rates reveals that the frequency of
   growth anomalies has increased since the late 1990s throughout most of
   the world's coral reef ecosystems. Continuous coral growth histories
   provide valuable retrospective information on the coral response to
   environmental change and the consequences of anthropogenic climate
   change. Co-ordinated efforts to synthesize and combine global
   calcification histories will greatly enhance our understanding of
   current calcification responses to a changing ocean.

AB The effects of thermal stress caused by seasonal changes are becoming
   more severe and frequent with projections indicating increased intensity
   in the near future as a result of climatic change. Depending on the
   prevailing season, thermal stress challenges the hypothalamus to
   activate neuroendocrine changes that induce alterations in plasma fluid
   and blood cellular parameters. Variation exists in the erythrocytic,
   leucocytic and thrombocytic responses of different animal species and
   breeds during thermoregulation and artificial thermal stress
   amelioration. During heat stress, plasma fluid serves as an efficient
   thermoregulatory medium to reduce hyperthermia, but with negative
   consequences on the immune system as well as alteration in erythrocytic
   and thrombocytic variables. The thermoregulatory responses aimed at
   making evaporative heat loss more efficient during heat stress may alter
   the composition and distribution of blood cellular components to an
   extent that is dependent on the magnitude of heat stress and the
   thermoregulatory body fluid economy of the livestock. Thermoregulatory
   body fluid economy, which is influenced by morphology of the skin, hair
   coat and sweat glands, and respiratory rhythm of heat-stressed livestock
   may account for the expected decrease or increase in erythrocytic
   variables. The effects of season on leucocytic parameters of mammalian
   livestock seem variable with thermal stress accounting for most of the
   change in the tropics, while both thermal stress and photoperiod have
   been implicated in the subtropics. It is concluded that understanding
   the effect of thermoregulation on the dynamics of blood cellular
   components and plasma fluid in livestock may provide useful information
   in livestock breeding to select animals that are highly adapted to heat
   stress, and in adopting preventive measures against immunosuppression
   and hyper- or hypo-thermia associated with seasonality, thus improving
   livestock productivity.

   Carajas swamp in southeastern Amazonia. Ten AMS radiocarbon dates
   suggest that the sediment covers at least the last 73,000 years. Shifts
   between tropical forests and savanna, changes in species composition, as
   well as changes in fire frequency indicate several wet and dry periods
   during this time interval. During the assumed early Pleniglacial (73-50
   ka), the dominance of savanna vegetation reflects drier conditions,
   whereas vegetation changes in the mid-Pleniglacial (50-40 ka) suggest
   alternating wet and dry phases under generally cool conditions. The
   recorded next period before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows a
   transition to wetter and cooler conditions, followed by a cold and dry
   LGM and Late glacial. At the beginning of the Holocene, between 11.4 and
   10.2 cal ka, tropical forest expanded, reflecting stable and very humid
   conditions. During the early to mid-Holocene an increasingly seasonal,
   generally warm and dry climate established. Dry seasons were longer than
   at present during mid-Holocene times with a pronounced dry phase from 9
   to 3.4 cal ka. Only after 3.4 cal ka did modern tropical rainforests
   became established under present-day climatic conditions. Comparison
   with other palaeoecological studies in the Amazon basin and eastern
   Andean regions suggests that environmental changes in Serra Sul were
   strongly coupled with large scale climatic changes and sea surface
   temperature variability in the tropical Atlantic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cardiovascular mortality has been shown to increase in the winter.
   However, it is unclear whether cold temperature affects indicators known
   as cardiovascular markers. We evaluated the association between ambient
   temperature and cardiovascular markers using data collected
   retrospectively from 55,567 adults who had visited a health check-up
   clinic between 1995 and 2008. Non-parametric smoothing regressions were
   fitted to determine the shapes of association between temperature and
   cardiovascular markers such as blood pressure, lipid profiles, platelet
   count, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Mixed effect
   model was used to investigate the significance of the relationship
   between temperature and cardiovascular markers. Decreased ambient
   temperature was associated with an increase in systolic and diastolic
   blood pressures, platelet count and serum low density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, high density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol level declined with decreasing temperature. The
   hsCRP level increased with decreasing temperature in the minimum
   temperatures below 0 degrees C, but revealed a reverse association
   above. Our study suggests that excess cardiovascular mortality in cold
   weather might be associated with temperature-related variations of
   cardiovascular markers. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A proximate, biophysical model is proposed describing
   temperature-modulated variation in growth rate and differentiation rate
   in ectotherms, based upon the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation connecting
   enzyme kinetics and biological rates. Like the Sharpe-Schoolfield
   equation, the model assumes (1) that growth rate and differentiation
   rate can be described as controlled by one rate-limiting enzyme; in
   addition the model assumes (2) that the temperature coefficients of
   growth and differentiation are different. The model is used to predict
   temperature-dependent size variation of ectotherms at maturation as a
   result of the interaction of growth and differentiation. It is shown
   that the difference between the activation energy constants of growth
   and differentiation determines the slope of the size-temperature
   reaction norm. The structural and heritable variation in enzymes
   determines reaction norm shape without inferring regulatory genes. All
   thermodynamic parameters of the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation can be
   estimated empirically with nonlinear regression techniques. The
   biophysical model provides a proximate framework for genotypic models of
   reaction norm evolution; genetic variation in either growth or
   differentiation would lead to genotype by environment interaction. This
   proximate model of temperature sensitivity and temperature tolerance
   clarifies how temperature dependence of body size would evolve. (C) 1996

AB The ability of scleractinian corals to survive changes that are
   predicted in the global environment over the next century will lie in
   their physiological mechanisms of acclimatization. Corals display rapid
   modifications in behavior, morphology and physiology enabling them to
   photoacclimate to changing light conditions, a scenario that
   demonstrates considerable biological flexibility. Here we argue that the
   acclimatization mechanisms in corals are fundamentally similar to those
   exhibited by other invertebrate taxa, We discuss protein metabolism as a
   mechanism underlying acclimatization responses in reef corals, and
   explore the relationship between protein turnover, metabolic rate,
   growth rate, and acclimatization capacity. Our preliminary analyses
   suggest that corals with low growth rates (mu Ca/mgN/h) and high
   metabolic rates (mu O-2/cm(2)/hr), such as the massive species,
   acclimatize more effectively than those with high growth rates and low
   metabolic rates, a feature that is characteristic of branching species.
   We conclude that studies of protein turnover, combined with temporally
   relevant investigations into the dynamic aspects of coral dinoflagellate
   symbioses will provide considerable insight into why corals exhibit such
   a high level of variation in response to the same environmental
   challenge. Furthermore, a more detailed understanding of acclimatization
   mechanisms is essential if we are to predict how a coral assemblage will
   respond to present and future environmental challenges.

AB The aragonite skeleton of massive reef-building corals contains a record
   of the oceanic environment in which they grow. However, reading of the
   record requires understanding of how it is archived, a process
   complicated by the elaborate skeletal construction and seasonal growth
   patterns that characterize many species. In this study, we assess the
   utility of the massive brain coral Diploria labyrinthiformis as an
   archive of sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the western
   North Atlantic. In situ staining of live colonies combined with
   microscale analysis of skeletal chemistry indicate that D.
   labyrinthiformis grows throughout the year on Bermuda and records the
   full annual cycle of SST variability. However, skeleton accreted during
   the summer is overlain (thickened) by skeleton accreted during the
   subsequent fall and winter. As a result, conventional coarse sampling
   for delta(18)O enables seasonal delta(18)O cycles to be resolved but
   these do not capture the full amplitude of the annual SST cycle. Our
   data show that the shallow gradient of the delta(18)O-SST regression
   equation derived for D. labyrinthiformis (-0.113parts per thousand
   degreesC(-1)) relative to the expected -0.22parts per thousand
   degreesC(-1) for marine skeletons results from dampening of the
   summertime peak in delta(18)O. In contrast, skeleton accreted during the
   winter is not thickened and wintertime delta(18)O captures the
   interannual wintertime SST variability at this site. Using SIMS ion
   microprobe to analyse strontium to calcium ratios (Sr/Ca), we avoided
   the thickening deposits and were able to resolve the full amplitude of
   the annual Sr/Ca cycle. The Sr/Ca-SST relationship obtained for D.
   labyrinthiformis (-0.0843 mmol/mol degreesC(-1)) corresponds to that
   derived from fast-growing tropical reef corals. X-ray intensity ratios,
   used as a proxy for skeletal density, reveal the expected seasonal
   changes associated with growth banding as well as variability on
   interannual and decadal timescales. These variations are well correlated
   with wintertime SST variability in the subtropical gyre and may be a
   valuable proxy thermometer for the North Atlantic.

AB Benthic macroalga or seaweed, a wonder plant in the sea, has been
   attracting the human mind since centuries. Countries of south and South
   East Asia have Put in extensive use of this plant for various purposes
   such as food, feed, fodder. etc. Development of seaweed in these
   countries was favored by their ready availability and prodimities to
   centers of human population that were particularly concentrated in
   coastal areas. In the beginning, those seaweed species that could be
   used for food were the first to be utilized and later the other species
   were found to yield industrial, medicinal. pharmaceutical and cosmetic
   products.
   A number of constraints will be required to be adapted if world's
   seaweed industry is to be developed and stabilized. This is mainly
   because of uncertainty in supply of raw material and Sudden burst in
   demand that occur in cycles. The seaweed resources have undergone
   successive periods of over exploitation and neglect. Alternatively. new
   areas shall have to be explored which could supply rich and high quality
   seaweeds. The Southern Ocean has immense potential for atrtracting
   urgent attention for development and exploitation of seaweed resources.
   A number of investigations are underway to assess the uses of Antarctic
   seaweeds. Recently, all active ingredient from Antarctic seaweed has
   been identified, which blocks the effects of metalloproteinase, all
   enzyme that accelerates the skin aging process. A skin care products
   derived from polar seaweeds has been a latest craze in France and are
   dedicated to men between 25 and 50 years of age. Antarctic red algae
   have recently been identified for their chemodiversity, containing
   compounds possessing antibacterial and other inhibitive properties to
   marine animals.The important fact remains that before we go for actual
   harvesting it is necessary that we have full details of their
   ecophysiology and annual cycle of occurrence at particular region and
   devise a legal framework after extensive debate with experts, for
   sustainable use of this valuable resource. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Phenotypic plasticity is the capability of a genotype to produce
   different phenotypes in different environments. Previous studies have
   indicated phenotypic variability in asexual, male, and female
   reproduction in Botryllus, schlosseri, a hermaphroditic, colonial
   ascidian, but not explicitly tested for genotype by environment
   interactions that indicate genetic variation in plastic responses.
   Consequently, clones derived from an estuarine population were deployed
   at their native site and a warmer, higher productivity site 10km
   up-river. Male reproduction was assayed by testis size, female
   reproduction by the number of eggs produced, and asexual reproduction by
   colony growth rate. To test for ontogenetic effects, data were collected
   from two different generations of zooids born in the field. Analyses of
   variance indicated plasticity in asexual and female reproduction during
   the first zooid generation and plasticity in all three traits during the
   third zooid generation. Reaction norms varied significantly among
   genotypes in direction and magnitude for asexual reproduction at both
   times, implying that selection on asexual reproduction is weak. Sperm
   production during the third zooid generation was significantly lower at
   the nonnative site, but there was no genotype by environment
   interaction. The reaction norms for female reproduction varied
   significantly among genotypes in direction and magnitude during the
   first zooid generation, but only varied in magnitude during the third
   generation, with egg production being higher in all genotypes at the
   nonnative site. Comparisons of weighted frequency distributions between
   sites demonstrated that differences in egg production in the third
   generation were due to increases in the proportion of reproductive
   zooids within a colony. The greater emphasis on female reproduction at a
   site associated with higher food availability and temperature-, and the
   greater emphasis on male reproduction at a colder, food-limited site,
   supports predictions from sex allocation theory. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss,

AB Oceanographic conditions during the past four centuries-sea surface
   temperature (SST) centennial and decadal variability, and changes in the
   water column structure-were reconstructed in high resolution from
   foraminiferal assemblages and stable isotope analyses completed on
   laminated sediments from two multicores (MC15, 415 m depth and MC26, 600
   m depth) from the southern Gulf of California (eastern subtropical
   Pacific). Total abundance counts and oxygen isotopic analyses were
   performed on two planktonic species, Globigerina bulloides (a proxy for
   winter SST) and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata (a proxy for late fall
   subsurface water temperature). Multidecadal oscillations in delta O-18
   values are considered to result primarily from extratropical forcing-sea
   level pressure anomalies in the north Pacific-via northwesterly winds
   weakening/strengthening in association with changes in the average
   position and intensity of the Aleutian Low. The downcore evolution of
   both biological proxies revealed an increase in SST since the 1600s,
   reflecting a gradual decline in upwelling activity during this period.
   This temperature trend implies a long-term change that cannot be
   explained by the same mechanisms associated with the multidecadal
   oceanographic variability. We proposed that the progressive warming of
   the surface waters is linked to a general northward shift of the ITZC
   resulted from increased solar irradiation, which accounts for larger net
   surface shortwave fluxes, affecting regional heating patterns and
   consequently the sensitive regional climate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   localities along a south-north transect (latitude: 10-31 degrees3 N).
   Size traits (body weight, wing length and thorax length) as well as a
   reproductive trait (ovariole number) followed a pattern of clinal
   variation, that is, trait value increased with latitude. Wing/thorax
   ratio, which is inversely related to wing loading, also had a positive,
   but non-significant correlation with latitude. By contrast, bristle
   numbers (sternopleural and abdominal) exhibited a non-significant but
   negative correlation with latitude. Sex dimorphism, estimated as the
   female/male ratio, was very low in Z. indianus, contrasting with results
   already published in other species. Genetic variations among populations
   were also analyzed according to other geographic parameters (altitude
   and longitude) and to climatic conditions from each locality. A
   significant effect of altitude was found for size traits. For abdominal
   bristles, a multiple regression technique evidenced a significant effect
   of both latitude and altitude, but in opposite directions. Genetic
   variations were also correlated to climate, and mainly with average year
   temperature. Taking seasonal variations into account failed however to
   improve the predictability of morphometrical variations. The geographic
   differentiation of Z.indianus for quantitative traits suggests adaptive
   response to local conditions, especially to temperature, but also
   reveals a complex situation according to traits investigated and to
   environmental parameters, which does not match results on other
   drosophilid species.

   These samples were compared to five African mainland populations,
   investigated with the same method. The results were also compared to
   data obtained on mass cultures of other populations from Africa and
   India. Three quantitative traits were measured on both sexes, wing and
   thorax length and sternopleural bristle number. We did not find any
   latitudinal trend among the American samples, while a significant
   increase in body size with latitude was observed in the Indian and, to a
   lesser degree, in the African populations. American populations were
   also characterized by their bigger size. Genetic variability, estimated
   by the intraclass correlation among isofemale lines, was similar in
   American and African populations. The intraline, nongenetic variability
   was significantly less in the American samples, suggesting a better
   developmental stability, the origin of which is unclear. A positive
   relationship was evident between intraline variability of size traits
   and the wing-thorax length correlation. Altogether, our data suggest
   that the colonizing propagule introduced to Brazil had a fairly large
   size, preventing any bottleneck effect being detected. The big body size
   of American flies suggests that they came from a high-latitude African
   country. The lack of a latitudinal cline in America seems to be related
   to the short time elapsed since introduction. The very rapid spread of
   Z. indianus all over South America suggests that it might rapidly invade
   North America.

   in China and from Finland with moderate temperature variation.
   Acclimation to large-amplitude temperature variation increased heat
   tolerance in both populations, but decreased cold tolerance and
   increased hsp70-2 expression in the Chinese population only. The latter
   result indicates a genotypic effect in the response to temperature

AB Fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) contamination of natural waters is a
   serious public health issue. Therefore, understanding and anticipating
   the fate and transport of FCB are important for reducing the risk of
   contracting diseases. The objective of this study was to analyze he
   impacts of climate change on he fate and transport of FCB. We modified
   both the soil and the in-stream bacteria modules in the soil and water
   assessment tool (SWAT) model and verified the prediction accuracy of
   seasonal variability of FCB loads using observations. Forty bias
   correcting GCM-RCM projections were applied in the modified SWAT model
   to examine various future climate conditions at the end of this century
   (2076-2100). Lastly, we also compared the variability of FCB loads under
   current and future weather conditions using multi-model ensemble
   simulations (MMES). The modified SWAT model yielded a satisfactory
   performance with regard to the seasonal variability of FCB amounts in
   the soil and FCB loading to water bodies. The modified SWAT model
   presented substantial proliferation of FCB in the soil (30.1%-147.5%)
   due to an increase in temperature (25.1%,). Also, increase in
   precipitation (53.3%) led to an increase in FCB loads (96.0%-115.5%)
   from the soil to water body. In the in-stream environment, resuspension
   from the stream bed was the dominant process affecting the amount of FCB
   in stream. Therefore, the final FCB loads increased by 71.2% because of
   the growing peak channel velocity and volume of water used clue to an
   increase in precipitation. Based on the results of MMES, we concluded
   that the level of FCB would increase simultaneously in the soil as well

AB Until recently, the distribution of diatom and chironomid assemblages
   and their attributes (species richness/diversity) in relation to water
   depth and sedimentary environments have been identified but not
   quantified. The influence of environmental variables on assemblage
   distribution and taxa richness in a deep, monomictic lake in So Miguel
   Island is assessed. Attention is given to community variation along a
   water-depth gradient. Sediment core samples were analysed for diatom
   content, chironomids, and grain-size clastic particles along three
   transects from the shoreline to the central deep basin of the lake at a
   resolution of 1 m water depth. Linear and unimodal regressions were used
   to test taxon richness, taxon diversity and taxon evenness versus water
   depth of each transect. A hump-shaped relationship between species
   richness and water depth was noted, with a peak occurring at mid-depth,
   meaning that samples located at that depth better represented the total
   subfossil assemblage living in lake Azul. Moreover, data indicate that
   both assemblages in Lake Azul, and taphonomic effects, were influenced
   by processes of clastic transport depending on the lake morphology.
   Results from this study allow us to access the spatial distribution of
   biological assemblages in clastic-dominated lakes with a high
   topographic gradient, and provide us with principal criteria that will
   allow us to determine coring locations that capture the true species
   diversity for studies in lakes.

AB The evolution of reptilian viviparity is favoured, according to the
   cold-climate hypothesis, at high latitudes or altitudes, where egg
   retention would entail thermal benefits for embryogenesis because of
   maternal thermoregulation. According to this hypothesis, and considering
   that viviparity would have evolved through a gradual increase in the
   extent of intrauterine egg retention, highland oviparous populations are
   expected to exhibit more advanced embryo development at oviposition than
   lowland populations. We tested for possible differences in the level of
   egg retention, embryo development time and thermal biology of oviparous
   Zootoca vivipara near the extreme altitudinal limits of the species
   distribution in the north of Spain (mean altitude for lowland
   populations, 235 m asl.; for highland populations, 1895 m asl.).
   Altitude influenced neither temperature of active lizards in the field
   nor temperature selected by lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient,
   and pregnant females selected lower temperatures in the thermal gradient
   than did males and nonpregnant females across altitudinal levels. Eggs
   from highland populations contained embryos more developed at the time
   of oviposition (Dufaure and Hubert's stages 3335) than eggs of highland
   populations (stages 3034) and partly because of this difference
   incubation time was shorter for highland embryos. When analysed for
   clutches from both altitudinal extremes at the same embryonic stage at
   oviposition (stage 33), again incubation time was shorter for highland
   populations, indicating genuine countergradient variation in
   developmental rate. Our results indicate that temperature is an
   environmental factor affecting the geographical distribution of
   different levels of egg retention in Z. vivipara, as predicted by the
   cold-climate hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity.

AB The draft genome data of Medaka Oryzias latipes shows that it has
   distinct intraspecific genetic variation. To survey the genetic
   variations contributing to environmental adaptation, we focused on the
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The complete mtDNA sequences of Medaka were
   compared among 8 local population stocks and 4 inbred strains
   established from genetically divergent groups. Inbred strain HSOK,
   derived from the Eastern Korean group of Medaka, has a mitochondrial
   gene order that was distinct from other Medaka groups. Phylogenetic
   trees based on the mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the
   mitogenome from the Shanghai stock (China) and HSOK strain were highly
   diverged from Japanese Medaka, and that the Japanese Medaka mitogenome
   was diverged into two groups; this result was fully consistent with
   those of the previous study using mtDNA-encode gene sequences. Among
   tRNA genes, the most divergent was the tRNAThr gene as reported in
   humans previously. The number of tandemly repeated 11 nucleotide units
   in the Medaka mtDNA control region (CR) varied greatly among local
   populations. The number of repeats was more variable in the Northern
   Japanese group (10-34) than in the Southern group (7-12), while two
   other Oryzias species, inhabiting tropical regions, had no repeats. A
   comprehensive comparison between the number of repeat units and
   meteorological data indicated that the number of repeats correlated to
   the index data of a cold environment and seasonal climatic change. In
   cold (5 degrees C) acclimated fish, the mRNA levels varied among
   mitochondria coding genes. mRNA of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene
   in some local stocks was induced by cold temperature and seemed to be
   correlated with the number of repeated sequences in the CR. This study
   revealed that the repeated sequences in the mtDNA CR might function for
   mtDNA gene expression and that the number of tandem repeats in Medaka
   mtDNA is likely related to adaptation to a harsh habitat. (C) 2010

AB Xerophytic thickets occur along the southwestern part of Madagascar.
   Although providing a wide variety of resources and services to the local
   population, this particular vegetation is subjected to deforestation.
   This study focuses on linking dendroclimatology and dendroecology by
   examining the spatial and temporal variability of the ecological growth
   conditions. Information from tree rings was retrieved, on one hand, to
   identify the problem of the limiting effects of past climate on growth
   and, on the other hand, to show how local environment takes part in the
   growth pattern of South Soalara species, in the southwestern part of
   Madagascar. Methods and principles of dendrochronology were applied on
   nine species belonging to seven botanical families. A total of 42 stem
   discs from 3 to 5 trees per species were collected at 30 cm height. All
   discs exhibited visible tree rings, but anatomical distinctness varied
   between species. This study highlighted the annual formation of tree
   rings through successful crossdating techniques. Then, from the nine
   constructed chronologies, species were grouped into three clusters.
   Analysis between precipitation and radial growth showed that the
   response to climate occurred mainly in rainy season. Large-scale
   climatic drivers such as sea surface temperature (SST1) of ENSO2 regions
   revealed a teleconnection with tree growth in cluster 1. Mean radial
   increments were computed from the measured tree ring width and varied
   from 0.66 to 1.98 mm year-1, showing that those species are
   slow-growing. All species were recorded as having a certain
   dendrochronological potential, which was ranked as useful for Rhizogum
   madagascariense and Terminalia gracilipes, poor for Gyrocarpus
   americanus and problematic for the other species. It is recommended to
   increase the number of wood samples and to provide more knowledge on the
   characteristics of the species in order to improve the quality of the
   chronology and the climatic signal on tree rings.

AB Hydrostatic pressure is an important, ubiquitous, environmental variable
   of particular relevance in the marine environment. However, it is widely
   overlooked despite recent evidence that some marine ectotherms may be
   demonstrating climate-driven bathymetric range shifts. Wide-ranging
   effects of increased hydrostatic pressure have been observed from the
   molecular through to the behavioural level. Still, no study has
   simultaneously examined these multiple levels of organisation in a
   single experiment in order to understand the kinetics, hierarchy and
   interconnected nature of such responses during an acute exposure, and
   over a subsequent recovery period. Here, we quantify the transcription
   of a set of previously characterised genes during and after acute
   pressure exposure in adults of the shrimp Palaemonetes varians. Further,
   we perform respiratory rate and behavioural analysis over the same
   period. Increases in expression of genes associated with stress and
   metabolism were observed during and after high-pressure exposure.
   Respiratory rate increased during exposure and into the recovery period.
   Finally, differential behaviour was observed under elevated hydrostatic
   pressure in comparison to ambient pressure. Characterising generalised
   responses to acute elevated pressure is a vital precursor to
   longer-term, acclimation-based pressure studies. Results provide a novel
   insight into what we term the overall stress response (OSR) to elevated
   pressure; a concept that we suggest to be applicable to other
   environmental stressors. We highlight the importance of considering more
   than a single component of the stress response in physiological studies,
   particularly in an era where environmental multi-stressor studies are
   proliferating.

AB We incubated eggs of Calotes versicolor at four constant temperatures
   ranging from 24degreesC to 33degreesC to assess the effects of
   incubation temperature on hatching success, embryonic use of energy, and
   hatchling phenotypes that are likely to affect fitness. All viable eggs
   increased in mass throughout incubation due to absorption of water, and
   mass gain during incubation was dependent on initial egg mass and
   incubation temperature. The average duration of incubation at
   24degreesC, 27degreesC, 30degreesC, and 33degreesC was 82.1 days, 60.5
   days, 51.4 days, and 50.3 days, respectively. Incubation temperature
   affected hatching success, energy expenditure for embryonic development,
   and several hatchling traits examined, but it did not affect the sex
   ratio of hatchlings. Hatching success was lowest (3.4%) at 33degreesC,
   but a higher incidence of deformed embryos was recorded from eggs
   incubated at this temperature compared to eggs incubated at lower
   temperatures. Most of the deformed embryos died at the last stage of
   incubation. Energy expenditure for embryonic development was, however,
   higher in eggs incubated at 33degreesC than those similarly incubated at
   lower temperatures. A prolonged exposure of eggs of C. versicolor at
   33degreesC appears to have an adverse and presumably lethal effect on
   embryonic development. Hatching success at 24degreesC was also low
   (43.3%), but hatchlings incubated at 24degreesC did not differ in any of
   the examined traits from those incubated at two intermediate
   temperatures (27C and 30degreesC). Hatchlings incubated at 33degreesC
   were smaller (snout-vent length, SVL) than those incubated at lower
   incubation temperatures and had larger mass residuals (from the
   regression on SVL) as well as shorter head length, hindlimb length,
   tympanum diameter, and eye diameter relative to SVL. Hatchlings from
   33degreesC had significantly lower scores on the first axis of a
   principal component analysis representing mainly SVL-free head size
   (length and width) and fore- and hindlimb lengths, but they had
   significantly higher scores on the second axis mainly representing
   SVL-free wet body mass. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry
   in eye diameter associated with incubation temperatures was quite high,
   and it was clearly consistent with the prediction that environmental
   stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures might produce
   the highest level of asymmetry. Newly emerged hatchlings exhibited
   sexual dimorphism in head width, with male hatchlings having larger head
   width than females. (C) 2002 Viley-Liss, Inc.

AB Neurospora crassa, has been a model organism for the Study of circadian
   clocks for the past four decades. Among natural accessions of Neurospora
   crassa, there is significant variation in clock phenotypes. In an
   attempt to investigate natural allelic variants contributing to
   quantitative variation, we used a quantitative trait. loci mapping
   approach to analyze three independent mapping populations whose
   progenitors were collected from geographically isolated locations. Two
   circadian clock phenotypes, free-running period and entrained phase,
   were evaluated in the 188 F-1 progeny of each mapping population. To
   identify the clock QTL, we applied two QTL mapping analyses: composite
   interval mapping (CIM) and Bayesian multiple QTL analysis (BMQ). When
   controlling false positive rates <= 0.05, BMQ appears to be the more
   sensitive of the two approaches. BMQ confirmed most of the QTL from CIM
   (18 QTL) and identified 23 additional QTL. While 13 QTL colocalize with
   previously identified clock genes, we identified 30 QTL that were not
   linked with any previously characterized clock genes. These are
   candidate regions where clock genes may be located and are expected to
   lead to new insights in clock regulation.

AB Agricultural production is under increasing pressure by global
   anthropogenic changes, including rising population, diversion of cereals
   to biofuels, increased protein demands and climatic extremes. Because of
   the immediate and dynamic nature of these changes, adaptation measures
   are urgently needed to ensure both the stability and continued increase
   of the global food supply. Although potential adaption options often
   consider regional or sectoral variations of existing riskmanagement
   (e.g. earlier planting dates, choice of crop), there may be a
   global-centric strategy for increasing productivity. In spite of the
   recognition that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is an essential plant
   resource that has increased globally by approximately 25 per cent since
   1959, efforts to increase the biological conversion of atmospheric CO2
   to stimulate seed yield through crop selection is not generally
   recognized as an effective adaptation measure. In this review, we
   challenge that viewpoint through an assessment of existing studies on
   CO2 and intraspecific variability to illustrate the potential biological
   basis for differential plant response among crop lines and demonstrate
   that while technical hurdles remain, active selection and breeding for
   CO2 responsiveness among cereal varieties may provide one of the
   simplest and direct strategies for increasing global yields and
   maintaining food security with anthropogenic change.

AB Inter-population variations in growth rate can result from independent
   or interactive effects of genetic and environmental factors, and be
   induced by some physiological differences as well. Toad-headed lizards
   (Phrynocephalus vlangalil) from a higher-elevation population were shown
   to have a higher growth rate than those from a lower-elevation
   population. The physiological basis of growth rate variation in this
   species is not well understood. Here, we investigated the feeding
   performance and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of lower- and
   higher-elevation individuals at different test ambient temperatures to
   evaluate the role of differences in energy intake, assimilation
   efficiency and metabolic expenditure on growth rate variations. Within
   the range of 25 - 35 degrees C, lizard RMR increased with increasing
   test ambient temperature, but food intake, apparent digestive
   coefficient (ADC, food energy minus faecal energy divided by food
   energy), and assimilation efficiency (AE, food energy minus faecal and
   urinary energy divided by food energy) were less thermally sensitive in
   both populations. Higher-elevation lizards tended to eat more food and
   have a lower RMR than lower-elevation ones, despite the lack of
   differences in ADC and AE. Our result showed that more energy intake and
   reduced maintenance cost may be associated with the higher growth rate
   of higher-elevation lizards. Accordingly, inter-population differences
   in energy acquisition and expenditure could act as potential sources for
   geographic variation in growth rate.

AB ABSCISIC ACID-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN1 (AREB1) (i.e., ABF2)
   is a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the
   abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element (ABRE) motif in the promoter
   region of ABA-inducible genes. Here, we show that expression of the
   intact AREB1 gene on its own is insufficient to lead to expression of
   downstream genes under normal growth conditions. To overcome the masked
   transactivation activity of AREB1, we created an activated form of AREB1
   (AREB1 Delta QT). AREB1 Delta QT-overexpressing plants showed ABA
   hypersensitivity and enhanced drought tolerance, and eight genes with
   two or more ABRE motifs in the promoter regions in two groups were
   greatly upregulated:late embryogenesis abundant class genes and ABA- and
   drought stress-inducible regulatory genes. By contrast, an areb1 null
   mutant and a dominant loss-of-function mutant of AREB1 (AREB1:RD) with a
   repression domain exhibited ABA insensitivity. Furthermore, AREB1: RD
   plants displayed reduced survival under dehydration, and three of the
   eight greatly upregulated genes were downregulated, including genes for
   linker histone H1 and AAA ATPase, which govern gene expression and
   multiple cellular activities through protein folding, respectively.
   Thus, these data suggest that AREB1 regulates novel ABRE-dependent ABA
   signaling that enhances drought tolerance in vegetative tissues.

AB We performed a transplant experiment to compare the life histories and
   morphologies of five geographically representative antlion Myrmeleon
   hyalinus populations along a sharp climatic gradient, from a
   Mediterranean climate in Israel's north to a desert climate in the
   south. Larvae were raised in two environmental chambers simulating
   Mediterranean and desert climates to investigate the extent to which the
   different populations exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Along the
   north-to-south climatic gradient, we observed a gradient in body mass
   prior to pupation and in pupation rate. Mediterranean populations
   suffered higher mortality rate when exposed to desert conditions,
   whereas the mortality rate of desert populations was consistent between
   Mediterranean and desert conditions. Our results regarding body mass,
   pupation rate and mortality rate suggest that Mediterranean populations
   had a more flexible response compared with desert populations. An
   analysis of digital photographs was used to measure population
   morphological differences, which were usually indicative of a decrease
   in trait size along the north-to-south gradient. We show how climatic
   gradients translate into phenotypic differences in an antlion population
   and provide a morphometric tool to distinguish between instar stages.

AB We investigated the effect of environmental conditions on Atlantic
   mackerel spawning habitat in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL).
   Based on generalized additive models, we (i) modelled the optimal
   spawning habitat of mackerel in the sGSL using daily egg production
   (DEP) in June, (ii) predicted known and new potential present spawning
   habitats in the GSL and the north-west Atlantic, and (iii) assessed how
   they respond to future climate change. Our findings showed that both
   mackerel presence-absence and given-presence DEP were associated with
   sea surface temperature (10-16.5 degrees C), salinity above 31 and depth
   < 120 m. Adding zooplankton showed a marked effect on the DEP
   given-presence compared to the presence-absence. Predictions of spawning
   habitats under present (1999-2012) and future scenario (2066-2085)
   conditions were estimated from the presence-absence model without
   zooplankton, using physical conditions of the BNAM. Under present
   conditions, our model predicted well the main spawning habitat in the
   sGSL and other known secondary spawning habitats in the northern GSL
   (nGSL), the western and southern Newfoundland, and the north-west
   Atlantic coast. Under future conditions, our study suggests that
   spawning habitats in the sGSL and the nGSL would expand. Our results,
   therefore, suggest that mackerel could benefit from a warmer GSL,
   minimizing the potential for a northward migration of the stock due to
   decreasing suitability of the sGSL as its main spawning ground, and a
   new but spatially limited potential habitat in Newfoundland coasts.
   These results can be used to inform stock management and develop
   adaptive management plans in the context of climate change.

AB Imperiled species that have been translocated or established in
   captivity can show rapid alterations in morphology and behavior, but the
   proximate mechanisms of such phenotypic changes are rarely known. Devils
   Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) are endemic to a single desert pool
   and are characterized by a small body, large head and eyes, and lack of
   pelvic fins. To lessen the risk of extinction, additional populations of
   C. diabolis were established in artificial refuges. Yet, pupfish in
   these refuges rapidly shifted to a larger body, smaller head and eyes,
   and greater body depth. Here we examined how food availability and
   temperature, which differ between these habitats, influence
   morphological development in closely related Amargosa River pupfish
   (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae). We were interested in knowing whether
   these environmental factors could developmentally shift Amargosa River
   pupfish toward the morphology typical of pupfish in Devil's Hole. By
   regulating food ration, we created groups of pupfish with low, medium
   and high growth rates. Pupfish with low growth showed proportionally
   larger head and eyes, smaller body depth, and reduction in pelvic fin
   development. Elevated temperature further inhibited pelvic fin
   development in all treatments. Pupfish in the low growth group also
   showed reduced levels of thyroid hormone, suggesting a possible
   physiological mechanism underlying these morphological changes. To test
   this mechanism further, pupfish were reared with goitrogens to
   pharmacologically inhibit endogenous thyroid hormone production. Pupfish
   given goitrogens developed larger heads and eyes, shallower bodies, and
   reduced pelvic fins. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in
   environmental factors affecting the growth and thyroid hormone status of
   juvenile pupfish may play a developmental role in generating the
   morphological differences between C. diabolis in Devil's Hole and the
   refuges. These findings illustrate the need to incorporate a mechanistic
   understanding of phenotypic plasticity into conservation strategies to
   preserve imperiled fishes.

AB This paper reviews recent literature concerning a wide range of
   processes through which climate change could potentially impact
   global-scale agricultural productivity, and presents projections of
   changes in relevant meteorological, hydrological and plant physiological
   quantities from a climate model ensemble to illustrate key areas of
   uncertainty. Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and
   these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate
   projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme
   events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on
   how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an
   agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different
   impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture
   on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity.
   Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been
   quantified. Perhaps most seriously, there is high uncertainty in the
   extent to which the direct effects of CO2 rise on plant physiology will
   interact with climate change in affecting productivity. At present, the
   aggregate impacts of climate change on global-scale agricultural
   productivity cannot be reliably quantified.

AB Oceanographic fronts and their associated physical processes create
   strong spatial patterns of food availability that may influence the
   metabolic processes of bivalves located within these areas. To
   investigate this prediction, we used mass size relationships, condition
   indices, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes to evaluate how
   the biological characteristics of the Patagonian scallop (Zygochlamys
   paragonica) are influenced by the Shelf Break Front (SBF) and the
   surrounding chlorophyll a concentration (CSAT). Scallops from 2
   transects across the front (38-39 degrees S, 55-56 degrees W, southwest
   Atlantic Ocean) were sampled with a nonselective dredge in October 2005.
   The results show that the SBF position, estimated from satellite-derived
   sea surface temperature, was more stable than the CSAT maximum
   concentrations. If muscle tissue is considered a better indicator of
   food shifts as previous studies indicate, scallops located far from the
   front have lower C isotopic signatures and C/N ratios than scallops
   located near the front. However, the lack of a shift in scallop organ
   conditions suggest that spatial differences in food supply are not
   strong enough during the time of year we sampled to impact scallop
   development, as may happen at a seasonal scale. Our results show that
   complicated interactions exist between oceanographic structures, food
   supply, and scallop life history characteristics.

AB Otobius megnini infests mainly domesticated and wild animals and
   occasionally humans. It has been identified as an agent of human and
   horse otoacariasis in Sri Lanka. The number of nymphal stages in the
   life cycle of O. megnini varies from one to three in different
   geographic regions. The present study determined the life cycle of O.
   megnini infesting the racehorses in Nuwara Eliya. A tick colony was
   initiated from fully engorged nymphs collected from horses and
   maintained at 10 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Immature
   stages were reared on New Zealand rabbits. Only the larvae weighing more
   than 0.9 mg (84.9%) moulted to nymphs with a pre-moulting period of
   5.6(+/- 1.7) days. None of the larvae maintained at 10 +/- 1 degrees C
   moulted. Larval survival was significantly higher at 28 +/- 1 degrees C
   (44.2 +/- 4.3 days) than at 22 +/- 1 degrees C (35.6 +/- 9 days). At 28
   +/- 1 degrees C, majority of nymphs (95.6%) weighing over 10 mg moulted
   into adults within 12.5(+/- 3.1) days. Nymphs kept at 10 +/- 1 degrees C
   underwent diapause for 81.1(+/- 72.0) days. Larger females (>13 mg;
   93.0%) laid eggs for of 44.6(+/- 17.8) days with a mean pre-oviposition
   period of 10.3(+/- 5.1) days. Females survived longer (369.8 +/- 128.3
   days) than males (210.4 +/- 54.1 days; Student's t-test; t=5.9, p =
   0.001). Some females laid eggs without mating. Otobius megnini
   successfully completed the life cycle within 123 days and has only one
   nymphal instar similar to the Neotropical population. Currently, O.
   megnini infestation is a serious problem to horses in the Nuwara Eliya
   racecourse and may pose a risk of spreading to dairy farms close by
   owing to its dynamic nature of the life cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Water resources in snow-dependent regions have undergone significant
   changes due to climate change. Snow measurements in these regions have
   revealed alarming declines in snowfall over the past few years. The
   Zayandeh-Rud River in central Iran chiefly depends on winter falls as
   snow for supplying water from wet regions in high Zagrous Mountains to
   the downstream, (semi-)arid, low-lying lands. In this study, the
   historical records (baseline: 1971-2000) of climate variables
   (temperature and precipitation) in the wet region were chosen to
   construct a probabilistic ensemble model using 15 GCMs in order to
   forecast future trends and changes while the Long Ashton Research
   Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was utilized to project climate
   variables under two A2 and B1 scenarios to a future period (2015-2044).
   Since future snow water equivalent (SWE) forecasts by GCMs were not
   available for the study area, an artificial neural network (ANN) was
   implemented to build a relationship between climate variables and snow
   water equivalent for the baseline period to estimate future snowfall
   amounts. As a last step, homogeneity and trend tests were performed to
   evaluate the robustness of the data series and changes were examined to
   detect past and future variations. Results indicate different
   characteristics of the climate variables at upstream stations. A shift
   is observed in the type of precipitation from snow to rain as well as in
   its quantities across the subregions. The key role in these shifts and
   the subsequent side effects such as water losses is played by
   temperature.

AB This article presents a Listeria monocytogenes growth model in milk at
   the farm bulk tank stage. The main objective was to judge the
   feasibility and value to risk assessors of introducing a complex model,
   including a complete thermal model, within a microbial quantitative risk
   assessment scheme. Predictive microbiology models are used under varying
   temperature conditions to predict bacterial growth. Input distributions
   are estimated based on data in the literature, when it is available. If
   not, reasonable assumptions are made for the considered context.
   Previously published results based on a Bayesian analysis of growth
   parameters are used. A Monte Carlo simulation that forecasts bacterial
   growth is the focus of this study. Three scenarios that take account of
   the variability and uncertainty of growth parameters are compared. The
   effect of a sophisticated thermal model taking account of continuous
   variations in milk temperature was tested by comparison with a
   simplified model where milk temperature was considered as constant.
   Limited multiplication of bacteria within the farm bulk tank was
   modeled. The two principal factors influencing bacterial growth were
   found to be tank thermostat regulation and bacterial population growth
   parameters. The dilution phenomenon due to the introduction of new milk
   was the main factor affecting the final bacterial concentration. The
   results show that a model that assumes constant environmental conditions
   at an average temperature should be acceptable for this process. This
   work may constitute a first step toward exposure assessment for L.
   monocytogenes in milk. In addition, this partly conceptual work provides
   guidelines for other risk assessments where continuous variation of a
   parameter needs to be taken into account.

AB Spring rainfall secular variability is studied using observations,
   reanalysis, and model simulations. The joint coherent spatio-temporal
   secular variability of gridded monthly gauge rainfall over Ethiopia,
   ERA-Interim atmospheric variables and sea surface temperature (SST) from
   Hadley Centre Sea Ice and SST (HadISST) data set is extracted using
   multi-taper method singular value decomposition (MTM-SVD). The
   contemporaneous associations are further examined using partial Granger
   causality to determine presence of causal linkage between any of the
   climate variables. This analysis reveals that only the northwestern
   Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly has direct causal links with spring
   rainfall over Ethiopia and mean sea level pressure (MSLP) over Africa
   inspite of the strong secular covariance of spring rainfall, SST in
   parts of subtropical Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean and MSLP. High
   secular rainfall variance and statistically significant linear trend
   show consistently that there is a massive decline in spring rain over
   southern Ethiopia. This happened concurrently with significant buildup
   of MSLP over East Africa, northeastern Africa including parts of the
   Arabian Peninsula, some parts of central Africa and SST warming over all
   ocean basins with the exception of the ENSO regions. The east-west
   pressure gradient in response to the Indian Ocean warming led to secular
   southeasterly winds over the Arabian Sea, easterly over central Africa
   and equatorial Atlantic. These flows weakened climatological
   northeasterly flow over the Arabian Sea and southwesterly flow over
   equatorial Atlantic and Congo basins which supply moisture into the
   eastern Africa regions in spring. The secular divergent flow at low
   level is concurrent with upper level convergence due to the easterly
   secular anomalous flow. The mechanisms through which the northwestern
   Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly modulates rainfall are further explored
   in the context of East Africa using a simplified atmospheric general
   circulation model (AGCM) coupled to mixed-layer oceanic model. The
   rainfall anomaly (with respect to control simulation), forced by the
   northwestern Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly and averaged over the
   30-year period, exhibits prevalence of dry conditions over East and
   equatorial Africa in agreement with observation. The atmospheric
   response to secular SST warming anomaly led to divergent flow at low
   levels and subsidence at the upper troposphere over regions north of 5(A
   degrees) S on the continent and vice versa over the Indian Ocean. This
   surface difluence over East Africa, in addition to its role in
   suppressing convective activity, deprives the region of moisture supply
   from the Indian Ocean as well as the Atlantic and Congo basins.

AB Barley is cultivated more widely than the other major world crops
   because it adapts well to environmental constraints, such as drought,
   heat, and day length. To better understand the genetic control of local
   adaptation in barley, we studied development in the nested association
   mapping population HEB-25, derived from crossing 25 wild barley
   accessions with the cultivar 'Barke'. HEB-25 was cultivated in
   replicated field trials in Dundee (Scotland) and Halle (Germany),
   differing in regard to day length, precipitation, and temperature.
   Applying a genome-wide association study, we located 60 and 66
   quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions regulating eight plant
   development traits in Dundee and Halle, respectively. A number of QTLs
   could be explained by known major genes such as PHOTOPERIOD 1 (Ppd-H1)
   and FLOWERING LOCUS T (HvFT-1) that regulate plant development. In
   addition, we observed that developmental traits in HEB-25 were partly
   controlled via genotype x environment and genotype x donor interactions,
   defined as location-specific and family-specific QTL effects. Our
   findings indicate that QTL alleles are available in the wild barley gene
   pool that show contrasting effects on plant development, which may be
   deployed to improve adaptation of cultivated barley to future
   environmental changes.

AB The acyl lipids making up the plastid membranes in plants and algae are
   highly enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids and are synthesized by

   which are located within the plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum,
   respectively. Here we report the results of biochemical as well as
   genomic analyses of lipids and fatty acids in the unicellular rhodophyte
   Cyanidioschyzon merolae. All of the glycerolipids usually found in
   photosynthetic algae were found, such as mono- and digalactosyl
   diacylglycerol, sulfolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,
   phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. However, the fatty
   acid composition was extremely simple. Only palmitic, stearic, oleic,
   and linoleic acids were found as major acids. In addition,
   3-trans-hexadecanoic acid was found as a very minor component in
   phosphatidylglycerol. Unlike the case for most other photosynthetic
   eukaryotes, polyenoic fatty acids having three or more double bonds were
   not detected. These results suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids are
   not necessary for photosynthesis in eukaryotes. Genomic analysis
   suggested that C. merolae lacks acyl lipid desaturases of cyanobacterial
   origin as well as stearoyl acyl carrier protein desaturase, both of
   which are major desaturases in plants and green algae. The results of
   labeling experiments with radioactive acetate showed that the
   desaturation leading to linoleic acid synthesis occurs on
   phosphatidylcholine located outside the plastids. Monogalactosyl
   diacylglycerol is therefore synthesized by the coupled pathway, using
   plastid-derived palmitic acid and endoplasmic reticulum-derived linoleic
   acid. These results highlight essential differences in lipid
   biosynthetic pathways between the red algae and the green lineage, which
   includes plants and green algae.

AB Long-term impact of former mining activities on the marine sub-Arctic
   ecosystem in the Ivittuut area, Arsuk Fjord, South Greenland, was
   studied by transplantation experiments with the blue mussel Mytilus
   edulis. Measurements of metal concentration in mussels were conducted
   using atomic absorption spectrometry (flame AAS) and graphite furnace
   atomic absorption spectrometry (graphite furnace AAS). Uptake and
   release of Pb were documented to be slow processes. For mussels
   transplanted from the pristine Kugnait Bay to the polluted mining site
   at Ivittuut, a continuous accumulation throughout the experiments was
   found. Linear uptake rates of 5.86, 6.94 and 11.62 mu g Pb month(-1) for
   small, medium and large mussels were found for a 6-week experiment,
   whereas exponential uptake rates of 0.26, 0.20 and 0.28 month(-1) were
   found for a 9-month experiment. It is estimated that the transplanted
   mussels will reach the same level as the resident population 12-16
   months following transplantation. Mussels transplanted from the polluted
   mining site at Ivittuut to the pristine Kugnait Bay depurated only 7-21%
   of their original Pb content, and the release was within the first 10
   days following transplantation, after which the Pb content remained
   constant.

AB Carbon utilization and allocation were examined between two populations
   of shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) to determine the possible effects of
   living in an area of high anthropogenic impact. Carbon assimilation has
   been studied in P. pugio, but no study has looked at how assimilation
   might be influenced by contaminants. Anthropogenic effects on carbon
   assimilation in grass shrimp represent a major unmeasured impact on the
   carbon budget of multi-cellular organisms in estuaries and near shore
   environments. The influence of anthropogenic contamination on carbon
   assimilation has implications for predicting the environmental impact of
   contaminants, for models of estuarine function, and trophic transfer
   from the dominant macroscopic detritus processor to species of direct
   economic importance. Shrimp budgets were compared between two
   populations, one from a highly polluted marsh creek system in Northern
   New Jersey, and one from a clean reference site in Southern New Jersey.
   All components of the carbon budgets were measured directly including
   carbon allocated to reproduction. Carbon lost to respiration was lower
   in shrimp from the polluted system allowing them to have increased
   reproductive output. This is examined in the context of previous studies
   that show lowered predation by a piscine predator at the polluted site,
   resulting in a trophic cascade and changes in ecosystem function due to
   anthropogenic impacts.

AB Although molecular techniques are revolutionising nematode taxonomy,
   morphological data still form the basis of nematode species
   descriptions. However, morphological characters show a natural
   variability that should be taken into account before describing new
   species. The current study presents the results of an elaborate
   morphometric study of Halicephalobus cf. gingivalis, including 15
   measurements and 13 indices of 540 specimens, the progeny of a single
   parthenogenetic female and cultured under different temperature and food
   conditions and measured in different adult age groups, i.e., young
   adults with a developed vulva but before the onset of oviposition,
   adults laying eggs, and old, post-reproductive adults near the end of
   their life cycle. The morphometric characters were analysed using both
   univariate (analysis of variance) and multivariate (principal components
   and canonical discriminant analysis) techniques. The main results reveal
   that the morphometric characters most used in Halicephalobus
   identification keys have a huge variability within a single progeny,
   e.g., body length 1.9 times longer than the shortest or ratio VA/tail
   length 3.9 times larger than the smallest. This variability has a
   magnitude that has not been observed in nematodes before. Further, by
   changing the environmental factors, the morphometric characters are
   influenced to an extent that one could assign - with seemingly
   'statistical support' - different 'species' of the genus to different
   subpopulations. With this experimental study we provide convincing
   elements to advocate an integrative taxonomic approach and to discourage
   the description of new species based only on morphometric differences.

   division, transport of cellular cargo, organelle positioning, and cell
   migration. Owing to their diverse functions, understanding microtubule
   function is an important part of cell biological research that can help
   in combating various diseases. For example, microtubules are an
   important target of chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel because of
   their pivotal role in cell division. Many functions of microtubules
   relate to the generation of mechanical forces. These forces are
   generally either a direct result of microtubule
   polymerization/depolymerization or generated by motor proteins that move
   processively along microtubules. In this review, we summarize recent
   efforts to quantify and model force generation by microtubules in the

AB The spatial and seasonal distribution of cetaceans and possible links
   with environmental conditions were studied at the Galician continental
   shelf. Data were collected between February-August 2001 and
   June-September 2003 during opportunistic surveys onboard fishing boats.
   Seven species of cetaceans were identified from 250 sightings of 6,846
   individuals. The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) was by far the most
   frequently sighted and the most widely distributed species.
   Spatiotemporal trends in cetacean distribution and abundance, and their
   relationships with environmental parameters (sea depth, SST and
   chlorophyll-a) were quantified using generalised additive models (GAMs).
   Results for all cetaceans were essentially the same as for common
   dolphins alone. Modelling results indicated that the number of common
   dolphin sightings per unit effort was higher further south. The number
   of individual common dolphins seen per sighting of this species (i.e.
   group size) was however higher in the north and west of the study area,
   higher later in the year and higher in 2001 than in 2003. In contrast,
   the number of common dolphin calves seen (per sighting of this species)
   was higher in the south. Models including environmental variables
   indicated larger common dolphin group sizes in deeper waters and at
   higher chlorophyll concentrations (i.e. in more productive areas). There
   was also a positive relationship between survey effort and group size,
   which is probably an artefact of the tendency of the survey platforms
   (fishing boats) to spend most time in areas of high fish abundance.
   Numbers of common dolphin calves per sighting were found to be higher in
   shallower waters. The results are consistent with common dolphins
   foraging mainly in deeper waters of the Galician continental shelf,
   while more southern inshore waters may represent a nursery area.

   revealed that the mean phenotypic value of each trait varied
   significantly among temperatures and wing morphs, but temperature
   reaction norms were not similar across all traits. Micropterous
   individuals were always smaller than macropterous individuals while
   expressing more phenotypic variation, a finding discussed in terms of
   canalization and life-history trade-offs. We observed little variation
   between the matrices of among-family (co)variation corresponding to each
   combination of temperature and wing morphology, with only one matrix of
   six differing in structure from the others. The implications of this
   result are discussed with respect to the prediction of evolutionary

   not genetically differentiated. However, 18 of the 24 independent traits
   measured showed significant differentiation among populations of
   Drosophila buzzatii, but only nine of 25 for Drosophila simulans. This
   difference in the number of traits might reflect higher habitat
   specificity and thus higher potential for local adaptation of D.
   buzzatii than D. simulans. We found clinal variation, as some traits

AB Populations of broadly distributed species commonly exhibit latitudinal
   variation in thermal tolerance and physiological plasticity. This
   variation can be interrupted when biogeographic breaks occur across the
   range of a species, which are known to affect patterns of community
   structure, abundance and recruitment dynamics. Coastal biogeographic
   breaks often impose abrupt changes in environmental characteristics
   driven by oceanographic processes and can affect the physiological
   responses of populations inhabiting these areas. Here, we examined
   thermal limits, performances for heart rate and plasticity in metabolic
   rate of the intertidal shrimp Betaeus emarginatus from seven populations
   along its latitudinal range (similar to 3000 km). The distribution of
   this species encompass two breaks along the southeastern Pacific coast
   of Chile: the northern break is characterized by sharp discontinuities
   in upwelling regimes, and the southern break constitutes a major
   discontinuity in water conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and
   nutrients), coastline topography and divergence of main oceanographic
   currents. For B. emarginatus, we found higher plasticity in metabolism
   at the sites sampled at the biogeographic breaks, and at the site
   subjected to seasonal upwelling. The variation in metabolic rate was not
   consistent with increasing latitude and it was not affected by breaks.
   The lower and upper thermal limits were lower in populations around
   breaks, although the optimum temperature decreased towards higher
   latitudes. Overall, whereas thermal limits and plasticity of metabolism
   are related to biogeographic breaks, metabolic rate is not related to
   increasing latitude or the presence of breaks in the sampled range.

AB I present a dynamic bioenergetic model that couples individual

   those following climate warming. The model predictions are uniquely
   based on first principles of morphology, life history, and thermal
   physiology. I apply the model to five populations of a widespread North
   American lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, to examine how geographic
   variation in traits and life histories influences ranges. This
   geographic variation reflects the potential for species to adapt to
   environmental change. I then consider the range dynamics of the closely
   related Sceloporus graciosus. Comparing predicted ranges and actual
   current ranges reveals how dispersal limitations, species interactions,
   and habitat requirements influence the occupied portions of thermally
   suitable ranges. The dynamic model predicts individualistic responses to
   a uniform 3 degrees C warming but a northward shift in the northern
   range boundary for all populations and species. In contrast to standard
   correlative climate envelope models, the extent of the predicted
   northward shift depends on organism traits and life histories. The
   results highlight the limitations of correlative models and the need for
   more dynamic models of species' ranges.

   We investigated in the earlier studies that female butterflies exhibit
   higher thermal tolerance than males in the Tianshan Mountains of China.
   We aim to understand the molecular mechanism of differences of thermal
   responses between sexes. We used RNA-seq approach and performed de novo
   assembly of transcriptome to compare the gene expression patterns
   between two sexes after heat stress. All the reads were assembled into
   84,376 transcripts and 72,701 unigenes. The number of differential
   expressed genes (DEGs) between control and heat shock samples was 175
   and 268 for males and females, respectively. Heat shock proteins genes
   (hsps) were up-regulated in response to heat stress in both males and
   females. Most of the up-regulated hsps showed higher fold changes in
   males than in females. Females expressed more ribosomal subunit protein
   genes, transcriptional elongation factor genes, and methionine-rich
   storage protein genes, participating in protein synthesis. It indicated
   that protein synthesis is needed for females to replace the damaged
   proteins due to heat shock. In addition, aspartate decarboxylase might
   contribute to thermal tolerance in females. These differences in gene
   expression may at least partly explain the response to high temperature
   stress, and the fact that females exhibit higher thermal tolerance.

AB Most bivalve shells contain macroscopic growth-increment patterns which
   form with an annual periodicity. These are best observed in radial shell
   cross-sections and consist of alternating dark (translucent in
   transmitted light) and light (opaque in transmitted light) increments. A
   couplet of dark and light increments constitutes one year's shell growth
   and subdivides the continuous shell growth record into successive,
   annual components. Conventional wisdom suggests that dark increments
   represent slow shelf growth associated with cold winter temperatures.
   Such a pattern characterizes shells of the much-studied hard clam,
   Mercenaria mercenaria, from coastal New England. Investigations of other
   species indicate, however, that not all dark increments form in response
   to cold temperatures. Yearly cycles in oxygen isotopic data from fossil
   and modern bivalves demonstrate considerable variability in the season
   of growth increment formation Isotopic data suggest Jurassic Gryphaea
   arcuata from Great Britain formed dark increments during the warmest
   season, as do many other bivalves. In fact, oxygen isotope profiles
   across the shells of modern and fossil Mercenaria spp. from the U.S.
   east coast and the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains indicate that in
   northern latitudes the dark increment typically forms during the winter
   season whereas in lower latitudes it forms during the summer to early
   fall. A transition zone occurs in the Middle Atlantic region where
   aspects of both patterns are observed. Water temperature extremes (high
   or low) appear to be the primary factor controlling the timing of dark
   (translucent) increment formation. Because of this dichotomy in the
   season of growth-increment formation high-resolution, isotopic sampling
   is invaluable when interpreting shell records in sclerochronological
   contexts, particularly for fossil bivalves.

AB Larval recruitment in Antarctic krill is known to be episodic and
   regional. We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors
   using an environmentally driven model of larval development from
   spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning,
   interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures,
   temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to
   identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that
   the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for
   successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest
   area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we
   assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large
   areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later
   spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often
   insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage
   before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in
   more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally
   remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae
   to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further
   limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval
   recruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross
   and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield
   Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the
   overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at
   higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better
   constrain the uncertainties in the model.

   against thermal denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts.
   According to the current paradigm, the adaptation of an organism for
   survival at higher or lower temperatures is facilitated by the
   adaptation of the component proteins. We note, however, that these
   observations have been carried out on relatively few proteins. The
   extent to which the conformational stabilities of all members of the
   proteome have been modulated for thermal adaptation remains unclear,
   with no direct experimental strategies to address this issue. Adapted
   extremophilies are likely to use it Multitude of molecular and
   biophysical strategies for survival and, therefore, evolution of
   specific biophysical properties of proteins for optimal function may not
   be necessary for all proteins in the proteome. Using it sequence-based
   predictor of protein stability, eScape, an in silico examination of
   several extremophilic proteomes shows a correlation between the
   collective stability of the proteins and the thermal range of survival
   for the organism as expected. Unexpectedly, however, the analysis shows
   that protein thermostability is modified to different extents across the
   proteome and depends oil the functional role for which the protein is
   involved. Identification of these differences provides unique
   opportunities to study interdependence within the proteome as well as
   the role that the proteome plays in the process of evolutionary thermal
   adaptation.

AB A positive genetic correlation between basal metabolic rate (BMR) and
   maximal ((V) over dotO(2)max) rate of oxygen consumption is a key
   assumption of the aerobic capacity model for the evolution of
   endothermy. We estimated the genetic (V-A, additive, and V-D,
   dominance), prenatal (V-N), and postnatal common environmental (V-E)
   contributions to individual differences in metabolic rates and body mass
   for a genetically heterogeneous laboratory strain of house mice (Mus
   domesticus). Our breeding design did not allow the simultaneous
   estimation of V-D and V-N. Regardless of whether V-D or V-N was assumed,
   estimates of V-A were negative under the full models. Hence, we fitted
   reduced models (e.g., V-A + V-N + V-E or V-A + V-E) and obtained new
   variance estimates. For reduced models, narrow-sense heritability
   (h(N)(2)) for BMR was <0.1, but estimates of h(2)(N) for (V) over
   dotO(2)max were higher. When estimated with the V-A + V-E model, the
   additive genetic covariance between (V) over dotO(2)max and BMR was
   positive and statistically different from zero. This result offers
   tentative support for the aerobic capacity model for the evolution of
   vertebrate energetics. However, constraints imposed on the genetic model
   may cause our estimates of additive variance and covariance to be
   biased, so our results should be interpreted with caution and tested via
   selection experiments.

AB Normal left-right patterning in vertebrates depends on the rotational
   movement of nodal cilia. In order to produce this ciliary motion, the
   activity of axonemal dyneins must be tightly regulated in a temporal and
   spatial manner; the specific activation pattern of the dynein motors in
   the nodal cilia has not been reported. Contemporary imaging techniques
   cannot directly assess dynein activity in a living cilium. In this
   study, we establish a three-dimensional model to mimic the ciliary
   ultrastructure and assume that the activation of dynein proteins is
   related to the interdoublet distance. By employing finite-element
   analysis and grid deformation techniques, we simulate the mechanical
   function of dyneins by pairs of point loads, investigate the
   time-variant interdoublet distance, and simulate the dynein-triggered
   ciliary motion. The computational results indicate that, to produce the
   rotational movement of nodal cilia, the dynein activity is transferred
   clockwise (looking from the tip) between the nine doublet microtubules,
   and along each microtubule, the dynein activation should occur faster at
   the basal region and slower when it is close to the ciliary tip.
   Moreover, the time cost by all the dyneins along one microtubule to be
   activated can be used to deduce the dynein activation pattern; it
   implies that, as an alternative method, measuring this time can
   indirectly reveal the dynein activity. The proposed protein-structure
   model can simulate the ciliary motion triggered by various dynein
   activation patterns explicitly and may contribute to furthering the
   studies on axonemal dynein activity.

   across the sapropel units associated with insolation-cycles 90 and 86 in

   southern Italy). Three benthic foraminiferal fossil associations
   (Associations A, B and C), identified by performing Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis on the quantitative data, can be considered diagnostic of the
   palaeoenvironmental conditions before, during and after the sapropel
   intervals. They indicate a gradual decrease of bottom water oxygenation
   prior to the onset of sapropel deposition and a rapid return to stable
   environmental conditions at the end of the sapropel events. The constant
   presence of benthic foraminifera throughout the sapropels implies that
   the bottom environment was not totally anoxic.
   The high-resolution distributional pattern of planktonic and benthic
   foraminifera within the sapropel associated with i-cycle 90 documents a
   surface water cooling with consequent rapid re-oxygenation of bottom
   waters that subdivides this interval in two phases. Both of them are
   characterized by an early subphase with warm climate conditions, a
   decrease of salinity in surficial water layers and dominated by the low
   oxygen tolerant benthic species Globobulimina affinis. The late subphase
   shows thermal stratification during summer and a relatively deep and
   oxygenated mixed layer during winter. In this subphase, the
   contemporaneous replacement of G. affinis, the "less opportunistic, but
   more resistant to low oxygen conditions" species with Bolivina alata,
   Bolivina dilatata and Brizalina spathulata, the "less resistant to low
   oxygen conditions" species, indicates the relative oxygen improvement in
   sediment pore water.
   The frequent changes detected in the sapropel-associated faunal

   species. Zaprtonus indianus is an Afrotropical drosophilid species that
   have recently invaded the Palearetic and the Neotropical regions. Here,
   we compared the variability of three size-related traits and one
   meristic trait the sternopleural (STP) bristle number, between
   wild-collected flies living under different conditions. a stressful
   Mediterranean environment in Egypt, and a benign tropical environment in
   Brazil. From cacti population, a F-l generation was also grown under the
   stable conditions of the laboratory Variability of size in nature had a
   variance 13 times greater than in the laboratory, but not affected by
   different climates. By contrast. STP variability was identical in nature
   and in the laboratory. Sexual dimorphism was also investigated with
   contrasting results between traits. It is suggested that the very high
   invasiveness of Z. indianus might be related to a better capacity to
   survive adverse conditions. To cite this article: A. Yassin et al., C.

AB Recently, a new type of hybrid resulting from the hybridization between
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii was described.
   These strains eXhibit physiological properties of potential
   biotechnological interest. A preliminary characterization of these
   hybrids showed a trend to reduce the S. kudriavzevii fraction of the
   hybrid genome. We characterized the genomic constitution of several wine
   S. cerevisiae X S. kudriavzevii strains by using a combined approach
   based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of gene
   regions, comparative genome hybridizations with S. cerevisiae DNA
   arrays, ploidy analysis, and gene dose determination by quantitative
   real-time PCR. The high similarity in the genome structures of the S.
   cerevisiae X S. kudriavzevii hybrids under study indicates that they
   originated from a single hybridization event. After hybridization, the
   hybrid genome underwent eXtensive chromosomal rearrangements, including
   chromosome losses and the generation of chimeric chromosomes by the
   nonreciprocal recombination between homeologous chromosomes. These
   nonreciprocal recombinations between homeologous chromosomes occurred in
   highly conserved regions, such as Ty long terminal repeats (LTRs), rRNA
   regions, and conserved protein-coding genes. This study supports the
   hypothesis that chimeric chromosomes may have been generated by a
   mechanism similar to the recombination-mediated chromosome loss acting
   during meiosis in Saccharomyces hybrids. As a result of the selective
   processes acting during fermentation, hybrid genomes maintained the S.
   cerevisiae genome but reduced the S. kudriavzevii fraction.

AB 1. A new laboratory-based growth model for brown trout (Salmo trutta)
   was used to explore latitudinal variation in growth among natural
   populations. The model included the effects of differences in ambient
   temperatures and fish size among populations. Annual growth rates of
   anadromous brown trout parr from 22. Norwegian populations at 61-70
   degreesN were compared with predictions from the growth model. Published
   field data from one Spanish, 15 British and four Danish populations at
   44-58 degreesN were included in the analysis to increase the latitudinal
   range.
   2. Among the Norwegian populations, the ratio between observed and
   predicted growth rates was not significantly different from 1.00 in
   eight rivers, but was significantly higher in eight, and was
   significantly lower in six. Observed growth was highest, relative to
   predicted growth, in the coldest rivers. In Spanish, British and Danish
   rivers, observed growth did not exceed predicted growth.
   3. The ratio between observed and predicted annual growth rate decreased
   significantly with increasing annual mean temperature. Observed annual
   growth was higher than predicted growth only in rivers with an annual
   mean temperature lower than 5.1 degreesC, and this indicates that some
   kind of thermal adaptation may occur in trout populations in the coldest
   rivers.
   4. Regression analyses showed that besides the direct effects of
   temperature and body size predicted by the growth model, annual growth
   rates were significantly related to annual mean temperature, densities
   of juvenile salmonids, duration of twilight (average for May-August) and
   latitude. Adding these variables to the original model increased the
   explanatory power from 73.9 to 80.6%.

AB As a first examination of the additive genetic variance of
   thermoregulatory traits in a natural population of endotherms. we
   studied the quantitative genetics of key physiological ecology traits in
   the leaf-cared mouse, Phyllotis darwini. We measured basal metabolic
   rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), maximum metabolic rate for
   thermoregulation (MMR), thermal conductance (C-T), body temperature
   (T-b), and factorial aerobic scope (FAS) in individuals acclimated to
   cold and warm conditions. For comparability with previous studies, we
   included the following morphological traits: foot length (F-L), total
   length (T-L), body mass (m(b), at birth, sexual maturity, 6 months, and
   8 months). Variance components were obtained from two different
   procedures: the expected variance component in an ANOVA Type III sum of
   squares and an animal model approach using restricted maximum
   likelihood. Results suggest the presence of additive genetic variance in
   F-L (h(2) = 0.47, P = 0.045), C-T of cold-acclimated animals (h(2) =
   0.66, P = 0.041). and night body temperature, measured in
   cold-acclimated animals (h(2) = 0.68, P = 0.080). Heritabilities of rub
   were near zero at all ages, but maternal effects and common environment
   effects were high and significant. We found no evidence of additive
   genetic variance in BMR, NST, MMR, or FAS (i.e., estimates were not
   significantly different from zero for all tests). Our results are in
   general agreement with previous studies of mammals that reported low
   heritability for: (1) BMR and MMR; (2) daytime body temperature; and (3)
   body mass for wild, but not laboratory or domestic, populations.

AB Most agricultural pests are poikilothermic species expected to respond
   to climate change. Currently, they are a tremendous burden because of
   the high losses they inflict on crops and livestock. Smallholder farmers
   in developing countries of Africa are likely to suffer more under these
   changes than farmers in the developed world because more severe climatic
   changes are projected in these areas. African countries further have a
   lower ability to cope with impacts of climate change through the lack of
   suitable adapted management strategies and financial constraints. In
   this study we are predicting current and future habitat suitability
   under changing climatic conditions for Tuta absoluta, Ceratitis cosyra,
   and Bactrocera invadens, three important insect pests that are common
   across some parts of Africa and responsible for immense agricultural
   losses. We use presence records from different sources and bioclimatic
   variables to predict their habitat suitability using the maximum entropy
   modelling approach. We find that habitat suitability for B. invadens, C.
   cosyra and T. absoluta is partially increasing across the continent,
   especially in those areas already overlapping with or close to most
   suitable sites under current climate conditions. Assuming a habitat
   suitability at three different threshold levels we assessed where each
   species is likely to be present under future climatic conditions and if
   this is likely to have an impact on productive agricultural areas. Our
   results can be used by African policy makers, extensionists and farmers
   for agricultural adaptation measures to cope with the impacts of climate
   change.

AB The potential role of solar variations in modulating recent climate has
   been debated for many decades and recent papers suggest that solar
   forcing may be less than previously believed. Because solar variability
   before the satellite period must be scaled from proxy data, large
   uncertainty exists about phase and magnitude of the forcing. We used a
   coupled climate system model to determine whether proxy-based irradiance
   series are capable of inducing climatic variations that resemble
   variations found in climate reconstructions, and if part of the
   previously estimated large range of past solar irradiance changes could
   be excluded. Transient simulations, covering the published range of
   solar irradiance estimates, were integrated from 850 AD to the present.
   Solar forcing as well as volcanic and anthropogenic forcing are
   detectable in the model results despite internal variability. The
   resulting climates are generally consistent with temperature
   reconstructions. Smaller, rather than larger, long-term trends in solar
   irradiance appear more plausible and produced modeled climates in better
   agreement with the range of Northern Hemisphere temperature proxy
   records both with respect to phase and magnitude. Despite the direct
   response of the model to solar forcing, even large solar irradiance
   change combined with realistic volcanic forcing over past centuries
   could not explain the late 20th century warming without inclusion of
   greenhouse gas forcing. Although solar and volcanic effects appear to
   dominate most of the slow climate variations within the past thousand
   years, the impacts of greenhouse gases have dominated since the second
   half of the last century.

AB Due to the close relationship of climate change with reference
   evapotranspiration (ETo), detecting changes in ETo spatial distribution
   and its temporal evolution at local and regional levels is favorable to
   comprehensively understand climate change-induced impacts on hydrology
   and agriculture. In this study, the objective is to identify whether
   climate change has caused variation of ETo spatial distribution in
   different analysis periods [i.e., long- (20-year), medium- (10-year),
   and short-term (5-year)] and to investigate its temporal evolution
   (namely, when these changes happened) at annual and monthly scales in
   Southwest China (SWC). First, we estimated ETo values using the United
   Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Penman-Monteith
   equation, based on historical climate data measured at 269 weather sites
   during 1973-2012. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated
   that the spatial pattern of annual ETo had significantly changed during
   the past 40 years, particularly in west SWC for the long-term analysis
   period, and west and southeast SWC in both medium- and short-term
   periods, which corresponded to the percent area of significant
   differences which were 21.9, 58.0, and 48.2 %, respectively. For
   investigating temporal evolution of spatial patterns of annual ETo,
   Duncan's multiple range test was used, and we found that the most
   significant changes appeared during 1988-2002 with the significant area
   of higher than 25.0 %. In addition, for long-, medium-, and short-term
   analysis periods, the spatial distribution has significantly changed
   during March, September, November, and December, especially in the
   corresponding periods of 1988-1997, 1983-1992, 1973-1977, and 1988-2002.
   All in all, climate change has resulted in significant ETo changes in
   SWC since the 1970s. Knowledge of climate change-induced spatial
   distribution of ETo and its temporal evolution would aid in formulating
   strategies for water resources and agricultural managements.

AB 1. For many fish species, survival during early life stages is linked to
   the size and energetic condition of females prior to reproduction. For
   example, females in good energetic condition are often more fecund and
   produce larger eggs and offspring than those in poor condition.
   2. We measured the characteristics of female yellow perch (Perca
   flavescens) that may influence annual population fluctuations. From 2005
   to 2007, we measured spatial variation in female reproductive traits,
   such as age, length, mass and energy density (J g(-1)) of somatic
   tissues and ovaries among four spawning aggregations of yellow perch in
   western and central Lake Erie.
   3. Maternal traits, such as somatic energy density and spawner age
   distribution, differed between the western and central basin, whereas
   reproductive traits, such as fecundity and ovarian energy density,
   differed across years.
   4. To understand the implications of observed differences in demographic
   rates (growth and mortality rates) between basins, we developed a
   deterministic model to simulate the total egg production in the western
   and central basins under different scenarios of fishing mortality.
   5. High growth rates and low mortality rates combined to produce higher
   modelled estimates of total egg production in the central than in the
   western basin, and a larger proportion of eggs were produced by old age
   classes in the central basin than in the western basin.
   6. Our results demonstrate that changing harvest levels for populations
   with different demographic rates can influence total reproductive output
   through complex interactions between age-specific mortality, growth and
   size-specific fecundity, which has implications for the population
   dynamics of yellow perch and related species across a broad geographic
   range.

AB Drought, associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can
   have considerable impact on tropical rainforests. Concern over drought,
   particularly given the possibility of an increase in its occurrence and
   intensity, has fostered a desire for an increased understanding of
   drought events and their impact to inform the development of a drought
   monitoring system. This paper investigates the use of National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution
   Radiometer (AVHRR) data in a drought monitoring system for the
   rainforests of Sabah, Borneo. These rainforests are dynamic with respect
   to their coupling with ENSO processes and in their biophysical
   properties, and such dynamism may have implications for how NOAA AVHRR
   data may be used. In particular, this paper explores the transferability
   of relationships between a drought indicator ( rainfall) and the
   response of the rainforest, as measured by four NOAA AVHRR variables (
   middle infrared reflectance; VI3; Ts/VI3 and Ts/NDVI), under particular
   site conditions. It was found that both spatial variability in forest
   biophysical properties and geographical variability in drought impact
   had implications for the transferability of relationships developed
   under local conditions across Sabah rainforests within a drought
   monitoring system. Suggestions are presented for how NOAA AVHRR data
   could be used, with a new drought monitoring index the
   Ts/VI3-recommended.

AB Habitat change in Rhodnius spp may represent an environmental challenge
   for the development of the species, particularly when feeding frequency
   and population density vary in nature. To estimate the effect of these
   variables in stability on development, the degree of directional
   asymmetry (DA) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the wing size and shape
   of R. prolixus and R. robustus-like were measured under laboratory
   controlled conditions. DA and FA in wing size and shape were significant
   in both species, but their variation patterns showed both inter-specific
   and sexual dimorphic differences in FA of wing size and shape induced by
   nutrition stress. These results suggest different abilities of the
   genotypes and sexes of two sylvatic and domestic genotypes of Rhodnius
   to buffer these stress conditions. However, both species showed
   non-significant differences in the levels of FA between treatments that
   simulated sylvan vs domestic conditions, indicating that the
   developmental noise did not explain the variation in wing size and shape
   found in previous studies. Thus, this result confirm that the variation
   in wing size and shape in response to treatments constitute a plastic
   response of these genotypes to population density and feeding frequency.

AB In ectothermic organisms, declining season length and lower temperature
   towards higher latitudes often select for latitudinal variation in
   growth and development. However, the energetic mechanisms underlying
   this adaptive variation are largely unknown. We investigated growth,
   food intake and growth efficiency of Rana temporaria tadpoles from eight
   populations along a 1500 km latitudinal gradient across Sweden. To gain
   an insight into the mechanisms of adaptation at organ level, we also
   examined variation in tadpole gut length. The tadpoles were raised at
   two temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C) in a laboratory common garden
   experiment. We found increased growth rate towards higher latitudes,
   regardless of temperature treatment. This increase in growth was not
   because of a higher food intake rate, but populations from higher
   latitudes had higher growth efficiency, i.e. they were more efficient at
   converting ingested food into body mass. Low temperature reduced growth
   efficiency most strongly in southern populations. Relative gut length
   increased with latitude, and tadpoles at low temperature tended to have
   longer guts. However, variation in gut length was not the sole adaptive
   explanation for increased growth efficiency as latitude and body length
   still explained significant amounts of variation in growth efficiency.
   Hence, additional energetic adaptations are probably involved in growth
   efficiency variation along the latitudinal gradient.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the water cycle -
   ET from the land surface returns approximately 60% of the global
   precipitation back to the atmosphere. ET also plays an important role in
   energy transport among the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.
   Current regional to global and daily to annual ET estimation relies
   mainly on surface energy balance (SEB) ET models or statistical and
   empirical methods driven by remote sensing data and various
   climatological databases. These models have uncertainties due to
   inevitable input errors, poorly defined parameters, and inadequate model
   structures. The eddy covariance measurements on water, energy, and
   carbon fluxes at the AmeriFlux tower sites provide an opportunity to
   assess the ET modeling uncertainties. In this study, we focused on
   uncertainty analysis of the Operational Simplified Surface Energy
   Balance (SSEBop) model for ET estimation at multiple AmeriFlux tower
   sites with diverse land cover characteristics and climatic conditions.
   The 8-day composite 1-km MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) was used as input land surface
   temperature for the SSEBop algorithms. The other input data were taken
   from the AmeriFlux database. Results of statistical analysis indicated
   that the SSEBop model performed well in estimating ET with an R2 of 0.86
   between estimated ET and eddy covariance measurements at 42 AmeriFlux
   tower sites during 2001-2007. It was encouraging to see that the best
   performance was observed for croplands, where R2 was 0.92 with a root
   mean square error of 13 mm/month. The uncertainties or random errors
   from input variables and parameters of the SSEBop model led to monthly
   ET estimates with relative errors less than 20% across multiple flux
   tower sites distributed across different biomes. This uncertainty of the
   SSEBop model lies within the error range of other SEB models, suggesting
   systematic error or bias of the SSEBop model is within the normal range.
   This finding implies that the simplified parameterization of the SSEBop
   model did not significantly affect the accuracy of the ET estimate while
   increasing the ease of model setup for operational applications. The
   sensitivity analysis indicated that the SSEBop model is most sensitive
   to input variables, land surface temperature (LST) and reference ET
   (ET0); and parameters, differential temperature (dT), and maximum ET
   scalar (K-max), particularly during the non-growing season and in dry
   areas. In summary, the uncertainty assessment verifies that the SSEBop
   model is a reliable and robust method for large-area ET estimation. The
   SSEBop model estimates can be further improved by reducing errors in two
   input variables (ET and LST) and two key parameters (Kmax and dT). (C)

AB We examined the variation of pelagic larval durations (PLDs) among three
   damselfishes, Dascyllus aruanus, D. marginatus, and D. trimaculatus,
   which live under the influence of an environmental gradient in the Red
   Sea. PLDs were significantly correlated with latitude, sea surface
   temperature (SST), and primary production (CHLA; chlorophyll a
   concentrations). We find a consistent decrease in PLDs with increasing
   SST and primary production (CHLA) towards the southern Red Sea among all
   species. This trend is likely related to higher food availability and
   increased metabolic rates in that region. We suggest that food
   availability is a potentially stronger driver of variation in PLD than
   temperature, especially in highly oligotrophic regions. Additionally,
   variations in PLDs were particularly high among specimens of D.
   marginatus, suggesting a stronger response to local environmental
   differences for endemic species. We also report the first average PLD
   for this species over a broad geographic range (19,82 +/- 2.92 days).

AB Understanding how populations adapt to different thermal environments is
   an important issue for biodiversity conservation in the context of
   recent global warming. To test the hypothesis that populations from
   southern region are more sensitive to climate change than northern
   region in cold-water species, we determined the thermal tolerance of two
   geographical populations of a cold-water fish, Rhynchocypris
   oxycephalus: the Hangzhou population from southern region and the
   Gaizhou population from northern region, then compared their
   transcriptomic responses between a control and a high temperature
   treatment. The results showed that the thermal tolerance range and
   thermal tolerance polygon area of Hangzhou population were narrower than
   the Gaizhou population, indicating populations from southern region were
   possibly more vulnerable. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that
   the Gaizhou population expressed more temperature responding genes than
   the Hangzhou population (583 VS. 484), corresponding with their higher
   thermal tolerance, while some of these genes (e.g. heat shock protein)
   showed higher expression in the Hangzhou population under control
   condition, suggesting individuals from southern region possibly have
   already responded to the present higher environmental temperature
   pressure. Therefore, these results confirm the prediction that
   populations from southern region are more sensitive to global warming,
   and will be important for their future conservation.

AB In the eurythermal cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, performance depends on
   hearts that ensure systemic oxygen supply over a broad range of
   temperatures. We therefore aimed to identify adjustments in energetic
   cardiac capacity and underlying mitochondrial function supporting
   thermal acclimation and adaptation that could be crucial for the
   cuttlefish's competitive success in variable environments. Two
   genetically distinct cuttlefish populations were acclimated to 11, 16
   and 21 degrees C. Subsequently, skinned and permeabilised heart fibres
   were used to assess mitochondrial functioning by means of
   high-resolution respirometry and a substrate-inhibitor protocol,
   followed by measurements of cardiac citrate synthase and cytosolic
   enzyme activities. Temperate English Channel cuttlefish had lower
   mitochondrial capacities but larger hearts than subtropical Adriatic
   cuttlefish. Warm acclimation to 21 degrees C decreased mitochondrial
   complex I activity in Adriatic cuttlefish and increased complex IV
   activity in English Channel cuttlefish. However, compensation of
   mitochondrial capacities did not occur during cold acclimation to 11
   degrees C. In systemic hearts, the thermal sensitivity of mitochondrial
   substrate oxidation was high for proline and pyruvate but low for
   succinate. Oxygen efficiency of catabolism rose as temperature changed
   from 11 to 21 degrees C via shifts to oxygen-conserving oxidation of
   proline and pyruvate and via reduced relative proton leak. The changes
   observed for substrate oxidation, mitochondrial complexes, relative
   proton leak and heart mass improve energetic efficiency and essentially
   seem to extend tolerance to high temperatures and reduce associated
   tissue hypoxia. We conclude that cuttlefish sustain cardiac performance
   and, thus, systemic oxygen delivery over short-and long-term changes of
   temperature and environmental conditions by multiple adjustments in
   cellular and mitochondrial energetics.

AB Marine herpesviruses are responsible for epizootics in economically,
   ecologically and culturally significant taxa. The recent emergence of
   microvariants of Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in Pacific oysters
   Crassostrea gigas has resulted in socioeconomic losses in Europe, New
   Zealand and Australia however, there is no information on their origin
   or mode of transmission. These factors need to be understood because
   they influence the way the disease may be prevented and controlled.
   Mortality data obtained from experimental populations of C. gigas during
   natural epizootics of OsHV-1 disease in Australia were analysed
   qualitatively. In addition we compared actual mortality data with those
   from a Reed-Frost model of direct transmission and analysed incubation
   periods using Sartwell's method to test for the type of epizootic, point
   source or propagating. We concluded that outbreaks were initiated from
   an unknown environmental source which is unlikely to be farmed oysters
   in the same estuary. While direct oyster-to-oyster transmission may
   occur in larger oysters if they are in close proximity (< 40 cm), it did
   not explain the observed epizootics, point source exposure and indirect
   transmission being more common and important. A conceptual model is
   proposed for OsHV-1 index case source and transmission, leading to
   endemicity with recurrent seasonal outbreaks. The findings suggest that
   prevention and control of OsHV-1 in C. gigas will require multiple
   interventions. OsHV-1 in C. gigas, which is a sedentary animal once
   beyond the larval stage, is an informative model when considering marine
   host-herpesvirus relationships.

AB We developed a geochemical atlas of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon
   and in its tributary, the Little Colorado River, and used it to identify
   provenance and habitat use by Federally Endangered humpback chub, Gila
   cypha. Carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) discriminate best
   between the two rivers, but fine scale analysis in otoliths requires
   rare, expensive instrumentation. We therefore correlated other tracers
   (SrSr, Ba, and Se in ratio to Ca) to delta C-13 that are easier to
   quantify in otoliths with other microchemical techniques. Although the
   Little Colorado River's water chemistry varies with major storm events,
   at base flow or near base flow (conditions occurring 84% of the time in
   our study) its chemistry differs sufficiently from the mainstem to
   discriminate one from the other. Additionally, when fish egress from the
   natal Little Colorado River to the mainstem, they encounter cold water
   which causes the otolith daily growth increments to decrease in size
   markedly. Combining otolith growth increment analysis and microchemistry
   permitted estimation of size and age at first egress; size at first
   birthday was also estimated. Emigrants < 1 year old averaged 51.2 +/-
   4.4 (SE) days and 35.5 +/- 3.6 mm at egress; older fish that had
   recruited to the population averaged 100 +/- 7.8 days old and 51.0 +/-
   2.2 mm at egress, suggesting that larger, older emigrants recruit
   better. Back-calculated size at age 1 was unimodal and large (78.2 +/-
   3.3 mm) in Little Colorado caught fish but was bimodally distributed in
   Colorado mainstem caught fish (49.9 +/- 3.6 and 79 +/- 4.9 mm)
   suggesting that humpback chub can also rear in the mainstem. The study
   demonstrates the coupled usage of the two rivers by this fish and
   highlights the need to consider both rivers when making management
   decisions for humpback chub recovery.

AB Human indigenous circumpolar populations have elevated basal metabolic
   rates (BMRs) relative to predicted values; this metabolic elevation has
   been postulated to be a physiological adaptation to chronic and severe
   cold stress. The present study examines BMR in the Yakut, an indigenous
   high-latitude population from the Sakha Republic of Russia to determine
   (1) whether the Yakut show evidence of an elevated BMR, (2) if the Yakut
   display evidence of age-related changes in BMR, and (3) whether
   lifestyle differences influence BMR. BMR was measured during the late
   summer in 75 women and 50 men (ages 18-56 years) from the Siberian
   village of Berdygestiakh. Measured BMR (+/-SEM) of the entire sample was
   significantly elevated (+6.5%) compared to predictions based on body
   mass (6,623.7 +/- 94.9 vs. 6,218.2 +/- 84.7 kJ/day; P < 0.001).
   Additionally, measured BMR for the entire sample was significantly
   higher than predictions based on fat-free mass (+20.8%) and surface area
   (+8.9%). Males and females both showed significant elevations relative
   to all three standards. The elevated BMR of the Yakut does not appear to
   be attributable to extreme levels of protein, since the Yakut consume a
   mixed diet with a substantial proportion of carbohydrates. No
   significant age-related changes in BMR were found when controlled for
   body composition. No significant relationship was found between
   lifestyle variables and BMR, suggesting the possibility of a genetic or
   developmental mechanism. This study provides additional evidence of
   metabolic elevation in indigenous circumpolar groups and has important
   implications for estimating the nutritional requirements of these
   populations. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Why is maximal insect body size relatively small compared to that of
   vertebrates? Possibly insect body size is limited by the capacity of the
   tracheal respiratory system to delivery oxygen down longer and longer
   tracheae to the tissues. If so, one possible outcome would be that
   larger insect species would have a smaller safety margin for oxygen
   delivery ( higher critical P-O2, P-c). We tested this idea by exposing
   inactive adult grasshoppers of a range of species and body sizes
   (0.07-6.4 g) to progressively lower oxygen atmospheres and measuring
   their ventilation frequency and their ability to maintain metabolic rate
   (indexed by CO2 emission rate). We analyzed effects of body size on
   these parameters by simple linear regressions, as well as methods to
   control for phylogenetic relatedness among species. We found
   interspecific variation in P-c, but P-c did not significantly correlate
   with body mass (average P-c across all species = 4 kPa). Maximal
   tracheal system conductance scaled approximately with mass(0.7), and
   estimated ventilation in hypoxia (ventilatory frequency x tidal volume)
   scaled directly with mass, suggesting that convection is the major
   mechanism of gas exchange in all these species. These comparative data
   strengthen the growing body of evidence that body size does not affect
   the safety margin for oxygen delivery in insects.

AB Dengue fever is the most prevalent arthropod-transmitted viral disease
   worldwide, with endemic transmission restricted to tropical and
   subtropical regions of different temperature profiles. Temperature is
   epidemiologically relevant because it affects dengue infection rates in
   Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the major vector of the dengue virus (DENV).
   Aedes aegypti populations are also known to vary in competence for
   different DENV genotypes. We assessed the effects of mosquito and virus
   genotype on DENV infection in the context of temperature by challenging
   Ae. aegypti from two locations in Vietnam, which differ in temperature
   regimes, with two isolates of DENV-2 collected from the same two
   localities, followed by incubation at 25, 27 or 32 degrees C for 10
   days. Genotyping of the mosquito populations and virus isolates
   confirmed that each group was genetically distinct. Extrinsic incubation
   temperature (EIT) and DENV-2 genotype had a direct effect on the
   infection rate, consistent with previous studies. However, our results
   show that the EIT impacts the infection rate differently in each
   mosquito population, indicating a genotype by environment interaction.
   These results suggest that the magnitude of DENV epidemics may not only
   depend on the virus and mosquito genotypes present, but also on how they
   interact with local temperature. This information should be considered
   when estimating vector competence of local and introduced mosquito
   populations during disease risk evaluation.

AB Understanding the relationship between growth and temperature will aid
   in the evaluation of thermal stress and threats to ectotherms in the
   context of anticipated climate changes. Most Pecten maximus scallops
   living at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere have a larger
   maximum body size than individuals further south, a common pattern among
   many ectotherms. We investigated differences in daily shell growth among
   scallop populations along the Northeast Atlantic coast from Spain to
   Norway. This study design allowed us to address precisely whether the
   asymptotic size observed along a latitudinal gradient, mainly defined by
   a temperature gradient, results from differences in annual or daily
   growth rates, or a difference in the length of the growing season. We
   found that low annual growth rates in northern populations are not due
   to low daily growth values, but to the smaller number of days available
   each year to achieve growth compared to the south. We documented a
   decrease in the annual number of growth days with age regardless of
   latitude. However, despite initially lower annual growth performances in
   terms of growing season length and growth rate, differences in
   asymptotic size as a function of latitude resulted from persistent
   annual growth performances in the north and sharp declines in the south.
   Our measurements of daily growth rates throughout life in a long-lived
   ectothermic species provide new insight into spatio-temporal variations
   in growth dynamics and growing season length that cannot be accounted
   for by classical growth models that only address asymptotic size and
   annual growth rate.

AB For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences
   developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms
   live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling
   between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal
   preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder
   phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are
   closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In
   addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen
   conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited
   thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner
   (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour
   in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the
   shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen
   concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the
   behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data
   from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold
   behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial
   predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations.
   Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially,
   but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast,
   individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were
   significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis.
   These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia,
   not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the
   preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated
   thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed
   by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen
   availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic
   environments.

AB Background: Low pollen viability may limit grapevine yield under certain
   conditions, causing relevant economic losses to grape-growers. It is
   usually evaluated by the quantification of the number of viable and
   non-viable pollen grains that are present in a sample after an adequate
   pollen grain staining procedure. Although the manual counting of both
   types of grains is the simplest and most sensitive approach, it is a
   laborious and time-demanding process. In this regard, novel image-based
   approaches can assist in the objective, accurate and cost-effective
   phenotyping of this trait.
   Results: Here, we introduce PollenCounter, an open-source macro
   implemented as a customizable Fiji tool for the high-throughput
   phenotyping of pollen viability. This tool splits RGB images of stained
   pollen grains into its primary channels, retaining red and green color
   fractionated images (which contain information on total and only viable
   pollen grains, respectively) for the subsequent isolation and counting
   of the regions of interest (pollen grains). This framework was
   successfully used for the analysis of pollen viability of a high number
   of samples collected in a large collection of grapevine cultivars.
   Results revealed a great genetic variability, from cultivars having very
   low pollen viability (like Corinto Bianco; viability: 14.1 +/- 1.3%) to
   others with a very low presence of sterile pollen grains (Cuelga;
   viability: 98.2 +/- 0.5%). A wide range of variability was also observed
   among several clones of cv. Tempranillo Tinto (from 97.9 +/- 0.9 to 60.6
   +/- 5.9%, in the first season). Interestingly, the evaluation of this
   trait in a second season revealed differential genotype-specific
   sensitivity to environment.
   Conclusions: The use of PollenCounter is expected to aid in different
   areas, including genetics research studies, crop improvement and
   breeding strategies that need of fast, precise and accurate results.
   Considering its flexibility, it can be used not only in grapevine, but
   also in other species showing a differential staining of viable and
   non-viable pollen grains. The wide phenotypic diversity observed at a
   species level, together with the identification of specific cultivars
   and clones largely differing in this trait, pave the way of further
   analyses aimed to understand the physiological and genetic causes
   driving to male sterility in grapevine.

AB Winter survival ability is important for autumn sown winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) in regions with cold winters. Wheat vernalization
   and photoperiod genes influence adaptation by regulating the timing of
   the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth to protect the
   floral meristem from cold temperatures. We evaluated winter injury of
   287 genotypes from the Facultative and Winter Wheat Observation Nursery
   (FAWWON) in six field environments over 3years (2014 to 2016) in
   Colorado. Entries were genotyped using single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) obtained by genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and at known
   vernalization (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1) and photoperiod (Ppd-B1 and
   Ppd-D1) loci using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays. Winter
   injury was observed and visually scored in five of the six environments.
   Mean GS prediction accuracies across the five environments, obtained
   through ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) using
   23,269 SNPs alone as random effects, ranged from 0.26 +/- 0.01 to 0.74
   +/- 0.00. Incorporation of alleles at Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1 loci as
   fixed effects in the GS models together with GBS markers as random
   effects provided the highest prediction accuracy with mean GS accuracies
   ranging from 0.34 +/- 0.01 to 0.78 +/- 0.00 across the five
   environments. Genomic selection models incorporating photoperiod alleles
   as fixed effects rarely improved GS prediction accuracy of winter
   injury. Genomic selection models that incorporate both major and minor
   genetic factors that influence low-temperature tolerance improved the
   model predictions for identifying genotypes that are best adapted to
   regions where cold winter temperatures are an important production
   constraint.

AB Population cycles have fascinated ecologists since the early nineteenth
   century, and the dynamics of insect populations have been central to
   understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic biological processes
   responsible for these cycles. We analyzed an extraordinary long-term
   data set (every 5 days for 48 years) of a tea tortrix moth (Adoxophyes
   honmai) that exhibits two dominant cycles: an annual cycle with a
   conspicuous pattern of four or five single-generation cycles
   superimposed on it. General theory offers several candidate mechanisms
   for generation cycles. To evaluate these, we construct and parameterize
   a series of temperature-dependent, stage-structured models that include
   intraspecific competition, parasitism, mate-finding Allee effects, and
   adult senescence, all in the context of a seasonal environment. By
   comparing the observed dynamics with predictions from the models, we
   find that even weak larval competition in the presence of seasonal
   temperature forcing predicts the two cycles accurately. None of the
   other mechanisms predicts the dynamics. Detailed dissection of the
   results shows that a short reproductive life span and differential
   winter mortality among stages are the additional life-cycle
   characteristics that permit the sustained cycles. Our general modeling
   approach is applicable to a wide range of organisms with
   temperature-dependent life histories and is likely to prove particularly
   useful in temperate systems where insect pest outbreaks are both density
   and temperature dependent.

AB Ontogenetic shifts in microhabitat use are widespread among taxa and can
   result in drastic shifts in thermal habitat among age classes. Likewise,
   geographic variation in climate along latitudinal gradients can cause
   differences in thermal environments among populations of a species.
   Using a common garden design, we examined four populations of a single
   species of semi-aquatic snake, Nerodia rhombifer, to determine whether
   ontogenetic shifts in habitat use (and/or body size) and latitudinal
   differences in ambient temperature have resulted in evolutionary changes
   in thermal tolerance. We found ontogenetic differences in thermal
   tolerance for all populations, with neonates tolerating temperatures
   2degreesC higher than adults, a pattern that is consistent with
   ontogenetic shifts in body size and microhabitat use in this species.
   There were differences in thermal tolerance among latitudes in neonates,
   suggesting genetic differences among populations, but adults showed no
   latitudinal differences. In combination, the increased thermal tolerance
   of neonates and the age-specific response to latitude suggest
   individuals may be most sensitive to selection on thermal tolerance as
   neonates. Although latitudinal differences exist in neonates, their
   tolerances were not ranked according to latitude, suggesting the effects
   of some other local factor (e.g., microclimate) may be important.
   Lastly, among neonates, females tolerate higher temperatures than males.

AB Pinus sylvestris tree-ring delta C-13 and delta O-18 records from
   locally moist sites in central and northern Sweden contain consistently
   stronger climate signals than their dry site counterparts.
   We produced twentieth century stable isotope data from Pinus sylvestris
   trees near lakeshores and inland sites in northern Sweden (near Kiruna)
   and central Sweden (near Stockholm) to evaluate the influence of
   changing microsite conditions on the climate sensitivity of tree-ring
   delta C-13 and delta O-18. The data reveal a latitudinal trend towards
   lower C and O isotope values near the Arctic tree line (-0.8 parts per
   thousand for delta C-13 and - 2.4 parts per thousand for delta O-18
   relative to central Sweden) reflecting widely recognized atmospheric
   changes. At the microsite scale, delta C-13 decreases from the dry
   inland to the moist lakeshore sites (- 0.7 parts per thousand in Kiruna
   and - 1.2 parts per thousand in Stockholm), evidence of the importance
   of groundwater access to this proxy. While all isotope records from
   northern and central Sweden correlate significantly against temperature,
   precipitation, cloud cover and/or drought data, climate signals in the
   records from moist microsites are consistently stronger, which
   emphasizes the importance of site selection when producing stable
   isotope chronologies. Overall strongest correlations are found with
   summer temperature, except for delta O-18 from Stockholm correlating
   best with instrumental drought indices. These findings are complemented
   by significant positive correlations with temperature-sensitive ring
   width data in Kiruna, and inverse (or absent) correlations with
   precipitation-sensitive ring width data in Stockholm. A conclusive
   differentiation between leading and co-varying forcings is challenging
   based on only the calibration against often defective instrumental
   climate data, and would require an improved understanding of the
   physiological processes that control isotope fractionation at varying
   microsites and joined application of forward modelling.

AB A coupled physics particle-tracking model, driven by realistic
   meteorological forcing was used to examine the dispersal and transport
   of plaice eggs and larvae in the year 2000 from two spawning grounds in
   the Irish Sea. The model included passive transport of eggs and early
   stage larvae, diel vertical movements for larvae between 7 and 10.5 mm
   in body-length and tidally synchronised, vertical movements for larger
   larvae (> 9 mm body-length). The year 2000 was chosen because of the
   availability of ichthyoplankton data with which to initialise the model.
   The majority of larvae originating from spawning in the eastern Irish
   Sea settled into nursery grounds along the Scottish, English and Welsh
   coasts, in agreement with previous findings. In contrast, a significant
   portion of larvae originating from spawning in the western Irish Sea was
   transported eastwards to these same nursery grounds. Transport across
   the Irish Sea resulted from the onset of tidally synchronised vertical
   behaviour encoded in the model for older larvae. Settlement of larvae
   into local nursery grounds along the Irish coast was limited. Because of
   the prevailing winds and currents in the region, plaice eggs and larvae
   are unlikely to be transported from east to west; in most years spawning
   in the western Irish Sea probably acts as an additional source of
   juveniles for nursery grounds along the Scottish, English and Welsh
   coasts. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Coastal marine Gasterosteus aculeatus were captured from seven locations
   along the Pacific coast of North America, ranging across 218 degrees
   latitude to test Jordan's rule, i.e. that vertebral number should
   increase with increasing latitude for related populations of fish.
   Vertebral number significantly increased with increasing latitude for
   both total and caudal vertebral number. Increasing length with latitude
   (sensu Bergmann's rule) was also supported, but the predictions for
   Jordan's rule held when controlling for standard length. Pleomerism was
   weakly evidenced. Gasterosteus aculeatus exhibited sexual dimorphism for
   Jordan's rule, with both sexes having more vertebrae at higher
   latitudes, but only males showing a positive association between
   latitude and the ratio of caudal to abdominal vertebrae. The number of
   dorsal- and anal-fin rays and basals increased with increasing latitude,
   while pectoral-fin ray number decreased. This study reinforces the
   association between phenotypic variation and environmental variation in
   marine populations of G. aculeatus.

AB To better understand the links between the carbon cycle and changes in
   past climate over tectonic timescales we need new geochemical proxy
   records of secular change in silicate weathering rates. A number of
   proxies are under development, but some of the most promising (e.g.
   palaeoseawater records of Li and Nd isotope change) can only be employed
   on such large samples of mono-specific foraminifera that application to
   the deep sea sediment core archive becomes highly problematic.
   "Dentoglobigerina" venezuelana presents a potentially attractive target
   for circumventing this problem because it is a typically large (>355 mu
   m diameter), abundant and cosmopolitan planktic foraminifer that ranges
   from the early Oligocene to early Pliocene. Yet considerable taxonomic
   and ecological uncertainties associated with this taxon must first be
   addressed. Here, we assess the taxonomy, palaeoecology, and ontogeny of
   "D." venezuelana using stable isotope (oxygen and carbon) and Mg/Ca data
   measured in tests of late Oligocene to early Miocene age from Ocean
   Drilling Program (ODP) Site 925, on Ceara Rise, in the western
   equatorial Atlantic. To help constrain the depth habitat of "D."
   venezuelana relative to other species we report the stable isotope
   composition of selected planktic foraminifera species within
   Globigerina, Globigerinoides, Paragloborotalia and Catapsydrax. We
   define three morphotypes of "D." venezuelana based on the morphology of
   the final chamber and aperture architecture. We determine the trace
   element and stable isotope composition of each morphotype for different
   size fractions, to test the validity of pooling these morphotypes for
   the purposes of generating geochemical proxy datasets and to assess any
   ontogenetic variations in depth habitat. Our data indicate that "D."
   venezuelana maintains a lower thermocline depth habitat at Ceara Rise
   between 24 and 21 Ma. Comparing our results to published datasets we
   conclude that this lower thermocline depth ecology for the Oligo-Miocene
   is part of an Eocene-to-Pliocene evolution of depth habitat from surface
   to sub-thermocline for "D." venezuelana. Our size fraction data advocate
   the absence of photosymbionts in "D." venezuelana and suggest that
   juveniles calcify higher in the water column, descending into slightly
   deeper water during the later stages of its life cycle. Our morphotype
   data show that delta O-18 and delta C-13 variation between morphotypes
   is no greater than within-morphotype variability. This finding will
   permit future pooling of morphotypes in the generation of the "sample
   hungry" palaeoceanographic records. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Mixture risk assessment predictions have rarely been confronted with
   biological changes observed in the environment. In this study, long-term
   monitoring of a European great lake, Lake Geneva, provides the
   opportunity to assess to what extent the predicted toxicity of herbicide
   mixtures explains the changes in the composition of the phytoplankton
   community next to other classical limnology parameters such as
   nutrients. To reach this goal, the gradient of the mixture toxicity of
   14 herbicides regularly detected in the lake was calculated using
   concentration addition and response addition models. A temporal gradient
   of toxicity was observed which decreased from 2004 to 2009. Redundancy
   analysis and partial redundancy analysis showed that this gradient
   explains a significant portion of the variation in phytoplankton
   community composition with and without having removed the effect of all
   other covariables. Moreover, species that are significantly influenced,
   positively or negatively, by the decrease of toxicity in the lake over
   time are highlighted. It can be concluded that the herbicide mixture
   toxicity is one of the key parameters to explain phytoplankton changes
   in Lake Geneva.

AB As technology at the small scale is advancing, motile engineered
   microstructures are becoming useful in drug delivery, biomedicine, and
   lab-on-a-chip devices. However, traditional engineering methods and
   materials can be inefficient or functionally inadequate for small-scale
   applications. Increasingly, researchers are turning to the biology of
   the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin filaments, kinesins,
   dyneins, myosins, and associated proteins, for both inspiration and
   solutions. They are engineering structures with components that range
   from being entirely biological to being entirely synthetic mimics of
   biology and on scales that range from isotropic continuous networks to
   single isolated structures. Motile biological microstructures trace
   their origins from the development of assays used to study the
   cytoskeleton to the array of structures currently available today. We
   define 12 types of motile biological microstructures, based on four
   categories: entirely biological, modular, hybrid, and synthetic, and
   three scales: networks, clusters, and isolated structures. We highlight
   some key examples, the unique functionalities, and the potential
   applications of each microstructure type, and we summarize the
   quantitative models that enable engineering them. By categorizing the
   diversity of motile biological microstructures in this way, we aim to
   establish a framework to classify these structures, define the gaps in
   current research, and spur ideas to fill those gaps. This article is

AB Understanding how populations respond to changes in climate requires
   long-term, high-quality datasets, which are rare for marine systems. We
   estimated the effects of climate warming on cod lengths and length
   variability using a unique 91-y time series of more than 100,000
   individual juvenile cod lengths from surveys that began in 1919 along
   the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Using linear mixed-effects models, we
   accounted for spatial population structure and the nested structure of
   the survey data to reveal opposite effects of spring and summer warming
   on juvenile cod lengths. Warm summer temperatures in the coastal
   Skagerrak have limited juvenile growth. In contrast, warmer springs have
   resulted in larger juvenile cod, with less variation in lengths within a
   cohort, possibly because of a temperature-driven contraction in the
   spring spawning period. A density-dependent reduction in length was
   evident only at the highest population densities in the time series,
   which have rarely been observed in the last decade. If temperatures rise
   because of global warming, nonlinearities in the opposing temperature
   effects suggest that negative effects of warmer summers will
   increasingly outweigh positive effects of warmer springs, and the
   coastal Skagerrak will become ill-suited for Atlantic cod.

AB We investigated the circadian synchronization/desynchronization (by
   field-study assessment of differences in period, tau, of 16 coexisting
   and well-documented rhythms) of 30 healthy firemen (FM) exposed to
   irregular, difficult, and stressful nocturnal work hours who
   demonstrated excellent clinical tolerance (allochronism). Three groups
   of FM were studied (A = 12 FM on 24-h duty at the fire station; B = 9 FM
   on 24-h duty at the emergency call center; C = 9 day-shift
   administrative FM) of mostly comparable average age, body mass index,
   career duration, chronotype-morningness/eveningness, and trait of field
   dependence/independence. The self-assessed 16 circadian rhythms were (i)
   physiological ones of sleep-wake (sleep log), activity-rest
   (actography), body temperature (internal transmitter pill probe), right-
   and left-hand grip strength (hand dynamometer), systolic and diastolic
   blood pressure (BP) plus heart rate (ambulatory BP monitoring device);
   (ii) psychological ones (visual analog self-rating scales) of
   sleepiness, fatigue, fitness for work, and capacity to cope with
   aggressive social behavior; and (iii) cognitive ones of eye-hand skill
   and letter cancellation, entailing performance speed (tasks
   completed/unit time) and accuracy (errors). Data (4-6 time points/24 h;
   2 591 480 values in total) were gathered continuously throughout two 8-d
   spans, one in winter 2010-2011 and one in summer 2011. Each of the
   resulting 938 unequal-interval time series was analyzed by a special
   power spectrum analysis to objectively determine the prominent tau. The
   desynchronization ratio (DR: number of study variables with tau = 24.0
   h/number of study variables x 100) served to ascertain the
   strength/weakness of each rhythm per individual, group, and season. The
   field study confirmed, independent of group and season, coexistence of
   rather strong and weak circadian oscillators. Interindividual
   differences in DR were detected between groups and seasons (chi(2),
   correlation tests, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Moreover, in each
   group, both in winter and summer, a normal distribution was observed in
   the number of FM with rhythms with tau = 24.0 h, e.g., ranging from 5/16
   (large desynchronization) to 16/16 (no desynchronization). Such a normal
   distribution with intraindividual stability over time (i.e., seasons) is
   consistent with the hypothesis of an inherited origin of a differential
   propensity to circadian desynchronization and which is supported by the
   distribution of tau s in winter and summer following the Dian-Circadian
   Genetic Model, i.e., with tau = 24.0 h, tau = 24.0 h + n(0.8 h), and tau
   = 24.0 h - n(0.8 h).

AB Predictive microbiology is the area of food microbiology that attempts
   to forecast the quantitative evolution of microbial populations over
   time. This is achieved to a great extent through models that include the
   mechanisms governing population dynamics. Traditionally, the models used
   in predictive microbiology are whole-system continuous models that
   describe population dynamics by means of equations applied to extensive
   or averaged variables of the whole system. Many existing models can be
   classified by specific criteria. We can distinguish between survival and
   growth models by seeing whether they tackle mortality or cell
   duplication. We can distinguish between empirical (phenomenological)
   models, which mathematically describe specific behaviour, and
   theoretical (mechanistic) models with a biological basis, which search
   for the underlying mechanisms driving already observed phenomena. We can
   also distinguish between primary. secondary and tertiary models, by
   examining their treatment of the effects of external factors and
   constraints on the microbial community.
   Recently, the use of spatially explicit Individual-based Models (IbMs)
   has spread through predictive microbiology, due to the current
   technological capacity of performing measurements on single individual
   cells and thanks to the consolidation of computational modelling.
   Spatially explicit IbMs are bottom-up approaches to microbial
   communities that build bridges between the description of
   micro-organisms at the cell level and macroscopic observations at the
   population level. They provide greater insight into the mesoscale
   phenomena that link unicellular and population levels.
   Every model is built in response to a particular question and with
   different aims. Even so, in this research we conducted a SWOT (Strength,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of the different
   approaches (population continuous modelling and Individual-based
   Modelling), which we hope will be helpful for current and future
   researchers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial community structure and the effects of several environmental

   sediment samples were collected at 6 sampling sites (3 sites from each
   of the 2 areas) on 15 February and 15 August 2009. Based on cluster
   analysis of the DGGE banding patterns, there were significant seasonal
   variations in the structure of the sediment bacterial community in the
   macrophyte- and algae-dominated areas, and site-specific variation
   within an area and between 2 areas. However, there were no significant
   between-area variations due to the large within-area variation. Analysis
   of DNA sequences showed that there were differences in the species
   composition of the sediment bacteria between the macrophyte- and
   algae-dominated area clone libraries. In the macrophy-tedominated area
   library, the bacterial community was dominated by Deltaproteobacteria,
   Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and
   Betaproteobacteria. OP10 was found in the library of this area but not
   in the algae-dominated area library. The algae-dominated area library
   was dominated by Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria,
   Gammaproteobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Cyanobacteria,
   Alphaproteobacteria, and Planctomycetes were found in this area library
   but not in the macrophyte-dominated area library. Canonical
   correspondence analysis demonstrated that total phosphorus and water
   temperature were the dominant environmental factors affecting bacterial
   community composition in the sediment.

AB Arabidopsis thaliana, like many species, is characterized by abundant
   genetic variation. This variation is rapidly being cataloged at the
   sequence level, but careful dissection of genetic variation in
   whole-organism responses to stresses encountered in the natural
   environment are lacking; this functional variation can be exploited as a
   natural mutant screen to determine gene function. Here, we document
   physiological and transcriptomic response to soil drying in 17 natural
   accessions of Arabidopsis. By imposing ecologically realistic stress
   conditions, we found that acclimation in Arabidopsis involved a strong
   signature of increased investment in photosynthesis, carbohydrate
   turnover, and root growth. Our results extend previous work in the
   Columbia accession suggesting that abscisic acid signaling pathways play
   an important role in drought stress response. We also identified several
   mechanisms, including an increase in leaf nitrogen concentration and
   upregulation of two-component signaling relays, that were common to most
   natural accessions but had not been identified in studies using only the
   Columbia accession. Principal component analysis reveals strong
   correlations between suites of genes and specific physiological
   responses to stress. The functional variants we identified may represent
   adaptive mutations in natural habitats and useful variants for agronomic
   improvement of crop species.

AB A survey on the time-temperature conditions of pasteurized milk in
   Greece during transportation to retail, retail storage, and domestic
   storage and handling was performed. The data derived from the survey
   were described with appropriate probability distributions and introduced
   into a growth model of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk which
   was appropriately modified for taking into account strain variability.
   Based on the above components, a probabilistic model was applied to
   evaluate the growth of L. monocytogenes during the chill chain of
   pasteurized milk using a Monte Carlo simulation. The model predicted
   that, in 44.8% of the milk cartons released in the market, the pathogen
   will grow until the time of consumption. For these products the
   estimated mean total growth of L. monocytogenes during transportation,
   retail storage, and domestic storage was 0.93 log CFU, with 95th and
   99th percentiles of 2.68 and 4.01 log CFU, respectively. Although based
   on EU regulation 2073/2005 pasteurized milk produced in Greece belongs
   to the category of products that do not allow the growth of L.
   monocytogenes due to a shelf life (defined by law) of 5 days, the above
   results show that this shelf life limit cannot prevent L. monocytogenes
   from growing under the current chill chain conditions. The predicted
   percentage of milk cartons-initially contaminated with 1 cell/1-liter
   carton-in which the pathogen exceeds the safety criterion of 100
   cells/ml at the time of consumption was 0.14%. The probabilistic model
   was used for an importance analysis of the chill chain factors, using
   rank order correlation, while selected intervention and shelf life
   increase scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that simple
   interventions, such as excluding the door shelf from the domestic
   storage of pasteurized milk, can effectively reduce the growth of the
   pathogen. The door shelf was found to be the warmest position in
   domestic refrigerators, and it was most frequently used by the consumers
   for domestic storage of pasteurized milk. Furthermore, the model
   predicted that a combination of this intervention with a decrease of the
   mean temperature of domestic refrigerators by 2 C may allow an extension
   of pasteurized milk shelf life from 5 to 7 days without affecting the
   current consumer exposure to L. monocytogenes.

AB Metabolomics is widely employed to monitor the cellular metabolic state
   and assess the quality of plant-derived foodstuffs because it can be
   used to manage datasets that include a wide range of metabolites in
   their analytical samples. In this review, we discuss metabolomics
   research on rice in order to elucidate the overall regulation of the
   metabolism as it is related to the growth and mechanisms of adaptation
   to genetic modifications and environmental stresses such as fungal
   infections, submergence, and oxidative stress. We also focus on
   phytochemical genomics studies based on a combination of metabolomics
   and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping techniques. In addition to
   starch, rice produces many metabolites that also serve as nutrients for
   human consumers. The outcomes of recent phytochemical genomics studies
   of diverse natural rice resources suggest there is potential for using
   further effective breeding strategies to improve the quality of
   ingredients in rice grains.

AB The extent to which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is involved in
   adaptive evolutionary change is currently being reevaluated. In
   particular, emerging evidence suggests that mtDNA genes coevolve with
   the nuclear genes with which they interact to form the energy producing
   enzyme complexes in the mitochondria. This suggests that intergenomic
   epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may affect
   whole-organism metabolic phenotypes. Here, we use crossed combinations
   of mitochondrial and nuclear lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus
   maculatus and assay metabolic rate under two different temperature
   regimes. Metabolic rate was affected by an interaction between the
   mitochondrial and nuclear lineages and the temperature regime. Sequence
   data suggests that mitochondrial genetic variation has a role in
   determining the outcome of this interaction. Our genetic dissection of
   metabolic rate reveals a high level of complexity, encompassing genetic
   interactions over two genomes, and genotype x genotype x environment
   interactions. The evolutionary implications of these results are
   twofold. First, because metabolic rate is at the root of life histories,
   our results provide insights into the complexity of life-history
   evolution in general, and thermal adaptation in particular. Second, our
   results suggest a mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of
   nonneutral mtDNA polymorphism.

AB Three cores from the scleractinian coral Montastraea faveolata and one
   core from the scleractinian coral Siderastrea siderea from the Belize
   barrier and atoll reef complex, Central America, were analyzed with
   regard to sclerochronology (skeletal extension rates) and stable isotope
   geochemistry (delta O-18 and delta C-13). The core material covers the
   time span from 1815 to 2000. The four coral time series were compared
   with available instrumental climate data, such as sea surface
   temperatures (GISST), cloud cover (GHCN), and precipitation (COADS).
   Skeletal extension rates Meas ured in the cores average 8.5-14 mm /year
   in M. faveolata and 8 mm/year in S. siderea. No systematic correlations
   between extension rates and instrumental climate data were detected.
   Annual variation in oxygen isotopes is 0.60.87% which accounts for
   monthly averages of sea-surface water temperature fluctuations of 3-4
   degrees C. In three cores from the Belize shelf and barrier reef
   negative correlations of 6180 with the GISST 2.3b data were observed.
   Time series analyses of the oxygen isotope data in these three cores
   revealed a decadal periodicity (10-15 years), which are attributed here
   to the influence of the Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) dipole
   variation. Three- to six-year periodicities, indicative of the El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in the same data are only weakly developed.
   Carbon isotopes of shallow-water corals also exhibit negative
   correlations with the GISST data. It is speculated that warmer years
   were characterized by increased cloud cover leading to reduced
   photosynthesis rates in the corals. Indeed, there is a negative
   correlation between delta C-13 and historic cloud-cover data. Carbon
   isotopes in the Belize shelf and barrier reef cores further exhibit
   general trends towards lighter values in time indicating the uptake of
   fossil fuel CO, in the coral skeletons. A proxy data time series from. a
   core from the restricted Turnefte Atoll lagoon differs from those of the
   Belize shelf and barrier reef cores, and there are fewer systematic
   correlations with historical climate and proxy data. This is probably a
   consequence of the strong influence of local environmental factors,
   which obliterate broader scale environmental parameters. First analyses
   of oxygen isotopes in fossil (Holocene) coral cores of M. faveolata
   indicate higher SSTs around 7, 000 ybp in Belize as compared to older;
   younger; and modern samples.

AB Calcification and reef growth processes dominated by corals and
   calcifying algae are threatened by climate and fishing disturbances.
   Twenty-seven environmental, habitat, and species interaction variables
   were tested for their influence on coral and calcifier cover in 201
   western Indian Ocean coral reefs distributed across similar to 20
   degrees of latitude and longitude and up to 20 m deep. These variables
   predicted more of the total between-site variance of calcifying organism
   cover (similar to 50%) than coral cover (similar to 20%).
   Satellite-derived environmental variables of temperature, light, and
   water quality predicted more of the coral and calcifier cover than
   feeding interactions when groups of related variables were analyzed
   separately. Nevertheless, when simultaneously evaluating all variables,
   the environmental variables better predicted coral cover, but proxies of
   feeding interactions better predicted calcifier cover. Coral and
   calcifier cover were most consistently negatively influenced by sea
   surface temperature distributions (right skewness), but the orange-lined
   triggerfish Balistapus undulatus consistently had a strong positive
   association with coral and calcifier cover. Herbivorous fish and
   Diadematidae sea urchins were not positively associated with coral and
   calcifier cover. A primary prey of B. undulatus, the rock-boring sea
   urchin Echinometra mathaei, had a strong negative association with coral
   cover and particularly calcifier cover. Island reefs had higher
   calcifier abundance than fringing reefs, which probably results from
   high Acropora and B. undulatus but low E. mathaei abundance. When
   comparing all variables and models, these taxonomic associations had
   more influence than environmental stress variables on calcifiers. Given
   the important predatory role of B. undulatus in controlling E. mathaei
   populations, fishing restrictions on this species could help attenuate
   calcification losses predicted by climate change.

AB For crops that are grown for their fruits or seeds, elevated
   temperatures that occur during flowering and seed or fruit set have a
   stronger effect on yield than high temperatures during the vegetative
   stage. Even short-term exposure to heat can have a large impact on
   yield. In this study, we used Arabidopsis thaliana to study the effect
   of short-term heat exposure on flower and seed development. The impact
   of a single hot day (35 degrees C) was determined in more than 250
   natural accessions by measuring the lengths of the siliques along the
   main inflorescence. Two sensitive developmental stages were identified,
   one before anthesis, during male and female meiosis, and one after
   anthesis, during fertilization and early embryo development. In
   addition, we observed a correlation between flowering time and heat
   tolerance. Genome-wide association mapping revealed four quantitative
   trait loci (QTLs) strongly associated with the heat response. These QTLs
   were developmental stage specific, as different QTLs were detected
   before and after anthesis. For a number of QTLs, T-DNA insertion
   knockout lines could validate assigned candidate genes. Our findings
   show that the regulation of complex traits can be highly dependent on
   the developmental timing.

   from SeaWinds/Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) to predict weekly catch
   estimates of the skipjack tuna in the South Brazil Bight. This was
   achieved by confronting the fishery data with model estimates and
   regressing the results on the satellite data. The fishery data were
   expressed by an index of catch per unit effort (CPUE) calculated as the
   weight of fish caught (in tonnes) by fishing week, and were divided into
   two series, called historical series (1996-1998; 2001), and validation
   year (2002). The output of model CPUE estimates is in good agreement
   with the historical weekly CPUE and generated updated weekly estimates
   that explained up to 62% of weekly CPUE from 2002. In general, the best
   proxy for the Bayesian weekly estimates is the gradient zonal SST field.
   The results refined previous knowledge of the influence of SST on the

AB Rapid uniform germination and accumulation of biomass during initial
   phase of seedling establishment is an essential phenotypic trait
   considered as early seedling vigour for direct seeded situation in rice
   irrespective of environment. Enhanced role of carbohydrate, amylase,
   growth hormones, antioxidant enzymes and ascorbic acid brings changes in
   vigour and phenotype of seedling.
   Early establishment and demanding life form dominate the surroundings.
   Crop plant that has better growth overdrives the weed plant and
   suppresses its growth. Seedling early vigour is the characteristic of
   seed quality and describes the rapid, uniform germination and the
   establishment of strong seedlings in any environmental condition. The
   phenotype of modern rice varieties has been changed into adaptable for
   transplanted rice with thirst toward water and selection pressure for
   semi-dwarf architecture resulting in reduced early vigour. Decreasing
   freshwater availability and rising labour cost drives the search for a
   suitable alternative management system to enhance grain yield
   productivity for the burgeoning world population. In view of these
   issues, much attention has been focused on dry direct-seeded rice,
   because it demands low input. A rice cultivar with a strong seedling
   vigour trait is desirable in case of direct seeding. However, seedling
   vigour has not been selected in crop improvement programmes in
   conventional breeding due to its complex nature and quantitative
   inheritance. Molecular markers have been proven effective in increasing
   selection efficiency, particularly for quantitative traits that are
   simply inherited. Marker-assisted selection approach has facilitated
   efficient and precise transfer of genes/QTL(s) into many crop species
   and suggests a speedy and efficient technique over conventional breeding
   and selection methods. In this review, we present the findings and
   investigations in the field of seedling vigour in rice that includes the
   nature of inheritance of physio-morphological and biochemical traits and
   QTLs to assist plant breeders who work for direct-seeded rice.

AB In order to assess pollutants and impact of environmental changes in the

   metals were traced through variations in 5 years growth bands sections
   of recent Porties coral skeleton. X-radiography showed annual growth
   band patterns extending back to the year 1925. Baseline metal
   concentrations in Porites corals were established using 35 years-long
   metal record from late Holocene coral (deposited in pristine
   environment) and coral from reef that is least exposed to pollution in
   the marine reserve in the Gulf of Aqaba. The skeleton samples of the
   collected corals were acid digested and analyzed for their Cd, Cu, Fe,
   Mn, Pb and Zn content using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer
   (FAAS). All metal profiles (except Fe and Zn) recorded the same metal
   signature from recent coral (1925-2005) in which low steady baseline
   levels were displayed in growth bands older than 1965, similar to those
   obtained from fossil and unpolluted corals. Most metals showed dramatic
   increase (ranging from 17% to 300%) in growth band sections younger than
   1965 suggesting an extensive contamination of the coastal area since the
   mid sixties. This date represents the beginning of a period that
   witnessed increasing coastal activities, constructions and urbanization.
   This has produced a significant reduction in coral skeletal extension
   rates. Results from this study strongly suggest that Porites corals have
   a high tendency to accumulate heavy metals in their skeletons and
   therefore can serve as proxy tools to monitor and record environmental
   pollution (bioindicators) in the Gulf of Aqaba. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mediterranean blue mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, an invasive
   species in California, has displaced the more heat-sensitive native
   congener, Mytilus trossulus, from its former southern range, possibly
   due to climate change. By comparing the response of their proteomes to
   acute heat stress we sought to identify responses common to both species
   as well as differences that account for greater heat tolerance in the
   invasive. Mussels were acclimated to 13 degrees C for four weeks and
   exposed to acute heat stress (24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees
   C) for 1 h and returned to 13 degrees C to recover for 24. h. Using
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry we
   identified 47 and 61 distinct proteins that changed abundance in M.
   galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, respectively. The onset temperatures
   of greater abundance of some members of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70
   and small Hsp families were lower in M. trossulus. The abundance of
   proteasome subunits was lower in M. galloprovincialis but greater in M.
   trossulus in response to heat. Levels of several NADH-metabolizing
   proteins, possibly linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), were lower at 32 degrees C in the cold-adapted M. trossulus
   whereas proteins generating NADPH, important in ROS defense, were higher
   in both species. The abundance of oxidative stress proteins was lower at
   32 degrees C in M. trossulus only, indicating that its ability to combat
   heat-induced oxidative stress is limited to lower temperatures. Levels
   of NAD-dependent deacetylase (sirtuin 5), which are correlated with
   lifespan, were lower in M. trossulus in response to heat stress. In
   summary, the expression patterns of proteins involved in molecular
   chaperoning, proteolysis, energy metabolism, oxidative damage,
   cytoskeleton and deacetylation revealed a common loci of heat stress in
   both mussels but also showed a lower sensitivity to high-temperature
   damage in the warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis, which is consistent
   with its expanding range in warmer waters.

AB Objectives This study provides the first investigation of non-shivering
   thermogenesis (NST) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity among an
   indigenous circumpolar population, the Yakut of northeastern Siberia.
   The study also examines the health significance of BAT activity in this
   population by testing the relationships between BAT thermogenesis and
   biomarkers of cardio-metabolic disease risk, such as percent body fat
   and blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Methods Results Data were
   collected in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) for 31 men and 43 women.
   Change in energy expenditure and BAT thermogenesis were quantified after
   a 30-minute mild cooling condition. Anthropometric dimensions, blood
   glucose, and lipid levels were also collected. On average, the skin
   temperature of the supraclavicular area was constant after cooling while
   the skin temperature of a point on the sternum dropped significantly (P
   < .001), thus suggesting the presence of active supraclavicular BAT
   among Yakut adults. Participants with evidence of greater BAT
   thermogenesis exhibited a larger percent change in energy expenditure (%
   Delta EE) and an increase in respiratory quotient (RQ) after cooling (P
   <= .05). While there was no relationship between BAT activity and blood
   lipid levels, BAT thermogenesis was positively associated with blood
   glucose levels (P < .01). Conclusions Yakut adults exhibit evidence of
   active BAT deposits. Given that there is a significant relationship
   between BAT activity and % Delta EE, it is possible that BAT plays a
   role in NST among Yakut adults. While the relationship between BAT and
   body composition is inconclusive, participants with greater BAT seemed
   to preferentially utilize glucose during cold stress exposure.

   flushing time and water quantity to control the diatom growth. First, we
   set up a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyze the dynamics of the
   bloom-formation species, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, in response to the
   environmental variation. The model took into account the time lags
   between the biovolume and the environmental parameters. The model
   indicated that, air temperature explained the most variance in
   biovolume, followed by soluble reactive silicon (SRSi), turbidity, TP,
   dam release, PAR, pH and total nitrogen (GAM, R-2 = 0.759). Afterwards,
   we applied the model to a new predictive dataset, in which values were
   simulated according to the assumed dam release and air temperature. The
   GAM predicted fewer releases for flushing by using this dataset than the
   measured data, implying a prospect of saving water when using this
   strategy. Finally, we drew a contour map to present the operating
   procedure of this strategy. Our flushing strategy is to regulate the dam
   release above a critical value dependent on the air temperatures
   predicted over the following few days. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Individuals of gregarious species often group with conspecifics to which
   they are phenotypically similar. This among-group assortment has been
   studied for body size, sex and relatedness. However, the role of
   physiological traits has been largely overlooked. Here, we discuss
   mechanisms by which physiological traits-particularly those related to
   metabolism and locomotor performance-may result in phenotypic assortment
   not only among but also within animal groups. At the among-group level,
   varying combinations of passive assortment, active assortment,
   phenotypic plasticity and selective mortality may generate phenotypic
   differences among groups. Even within groups, however, individual
   variation in energy requirements, aerobic and anaerobic capacity,
   neurological lateralization and tolerance to environmental stressors are
   likely to produce differences in the spatial location of individuals or
   associations between group-mates with specific physiological phenotypes.
   Owing to the greater availability of empirical research, we focus on
   groups of fishes (i.e. shoals and schools). Increased knowledge of
   physiological mechanisms influencing among-and withingroup assortment
   will enhance our understanding of fundamental concepts regarding optimal
   group size, predator avoidance, group cohesion, information transfer,
   life-history strategies and the evolutionary effects of group
   membership. In a broader perspective, predicting animal responses to
   environmental change will be impossible without a comprehensive
   understanding of the physiological basis of the formation and
   functioning of animal social groups.

AB Predicting species responses to climate change requires tracking the
   variation in individual performance following exposure to warming
   conditions. One ecologically relevant approach consists of examining the
   thermal responses of a large number of traits, both related with
   population dynamics and trophic interactions (i.e. a multi-trait
   approach). Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate
   models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes
   realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern
   France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the
   range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global
   warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We
   then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in
   caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana - including development, pupal
   mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits
   expressed against parasitoids - to this experimental imitation of global
   warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development
   (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval
   stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for
   larval escape ability to natural enemies ( + 60%). Conversely, warming
   elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves ( - 26%) and immunity
   (total phenoloxidase activity: - 34%). These findings confirm that
   traits should differ in their sensitivity to global warming, underlying
   complex consequences for population dynamics and trophic interactions.
   Our study strengthens the importance of combining a multi-trait approach
   with the use of realistic fluctuating regimes to forecast the
   consequences of global warming for individuals, species and species
   assemblages.

AB Early environments can profoundly influence an organism in ways that
   persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest
   temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important
   ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist
   and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important
   in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the
   role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data
   from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of
   incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic
   approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments,
   Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on
   average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation
   temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this
   influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted,
   with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = -8.42).
   Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology,
   performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate
   to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival.
   Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least
   one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential
   to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as
   the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6 degrees C versus 2 degrees
   C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the
   treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they
   were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the
   comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing
   the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The
   highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a
   large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of
   reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological
   and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general
   patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of
   incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow
   general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest
   temperatures under climatic change.

AB Understanding whether populations can adapt to new environmental
   conditions is a major issue in conservation and evolutionary biology.
   Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to environmental changes
   linked with human activities in river catchments. For instance, the
   clogging of bottom substratum by fine sediments is observed in many
   rivers and usually leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen
   concentrations in gravel beds. Such hypoxic stress can alter the
   development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos
   that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a
   common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of
   four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted
   populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive
   genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population.
   Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we
   measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of
   embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower
   survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found
   different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no
   population effect in both treatments. We also detected significant sire
   x treatment interactions in most populations and a tendency for
   heritability values to be lower under stressful conditions. Overall,
   these results reveal a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in salmon
   populations that nevertheless differ in their adaptive potential to
   hypoxia given the distinct reaction norms observed between and within
   populations.

AB Bright light therapy (BLT) is considered among the first-line treatments
   for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), yet a growing body of literature
   supports its use in other neuropsychiatric conditions including
   non-seasonal depression. Despite evidence of its antidepressant
   efficacy, clinical use of BLT remains highly variable internationally.
   In this article, we explore the autonomic effects of BLT and suggest
   that such effects may play a role in its antidepressant and
   chronotherapeutic properties. After providing a brief introduction on
   the clinical application of BLT, we review the chronobiological effects
   of BLT on depression and on the autonomic nervous system in depressed
   and non-depressed individuals with an emphasis on non-seasonal
   depression. Such a theory of autonomic modulation via BLT could serve to
   integrate aspects of recent work centered on alleviating allostatic
   load, the polyvagal theory, the neurovisceral integration model and
   emerging evidence on the roles of glutamate and gamma-hydroxybutyric
   acid (GABA).

AB This paper reviews recent progress made in our understanding of the
   functioning and variability of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS)
   on time scales varying from synoptic to long-term variability and
   climate change. The SAMS contains one of the most prominent summertime
   climate patterns in South America, featuring a strong seasonal
   variability in a region lying between the Amazon and the La Plata Basin.
   Much of the recent progress is derived from complementary international
   programs, such as the Monsoon Experiment South America (MESA), as well
   as from ongoing international programs such as the Large Scale Biosphere
   Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon Basin (LBA) and the La Plata Basin
   (LPB) Regional Hydroclimate Project, which includes the CLARIS LPB
   Europe-South America Network for Climate Change Assessment and Impact
   Studies in La Plata Basin Project. The latter assesses atmosphere-land
   surface interactions, the role of land use changes and aerosols from
   biomass burning considered as sources of variability and change in the
   SAMS functioning, characteristics and behaviour.
   The SAMS region is particularly susceptible to variations of climate due
   to the importance of hydroelectricity generation and the agricultural
   base of local economies. Also addressed in this report are projections
   of climate change and extremes, which are important for impact and
   vulnerability assessments. This discussion includes the need to identify
   and understand important processes that control the monsoonal climate,
   how these processes may vary and change, and how they may interact with
   key societal sectors, including water resource management, hydroelectric
   generation, agriculture, and agribusiness.
   This paper reports on the major contributions of MESA to the knowledge
   of characteristics, functioning and variability of the SAMS, and is
   based on recent studies and publications, and can be considered as an
   update of a previous review by C. S. Vera et al. (2006a). Copyright.

AB Recent scientific interest following the "discovery'' of lithodid crabs
   around Antarctica has centred on a hypothesis that these crabs might be
   poised to invade the Antarctic shelf if the recent warming trend
   continues, potentially decimating its native fauna. This "invasion
   hypothesis'' suggests that decapod crabs were driven out of Antarctica
   40-15 million years ago and are only now returning as "warm'' enough
   habitats become available. The hypothesis is based on a geographically
   and spatially poor fossil record of a different group of crabs
   (Brachyura), and examination of relatively few Recent lithodid samples
   from the Antarctic slope. In this paper, we examine the existing
   lithodid fossil record and present the distribution and biogeographic
   patterns derived from over 16,000 records of Recent Southern Hemisphere
   crabs and lobsters. Globally, the lithodid fossil record consists of
   only two known specimens, neither of which comes from the Antarctic.
   Recent records show that 22 species of crabs and lobsters have been
   reported from the Southern Ocean, with 12 species found south of 60
   degrees S. All are restricted to waters warmer than 0 degrees C, with
   their Antarctic distribution limited to the areas of seafloor dominated
   by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Currently, CDW extends further and
   shallower onto the West Antarctic shelf than the known distribution
   ranges of most lithodid species examined. Geological evidence suggests
   that West Antarctic shelf could have been available for colonisation
   during the last 9,000 years. Distribution patterns, species richness,
   and levels of endemism all suggest that, rather than becoming extinct
   and recently re-invading from outside Antarctica, the lithodid crabs
   have likely persisted, and even radiated, on or near to Antarctic slope.
   We conclude there is no evidence for a modern-day "crab invasion''. We
   recommend a repeated targeted lithodid sampling program along the West
   Antarctic shelf to fully test the validity of the "invasion
   hypothesis''.

AB Purpose: A novel application of infrared-C (IR-C) radiation (3-1000 mu
   m) on hemiparetic stroke patients was evaluated. Hot compresses (HC)
   were used on the paretic shoulders of patients in this
   placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of IR-C on skin
   temperature, electrodermal conductance (EC) and pain relief.
   Materials and methods: Skin temperature at the center of the middle
   deltoid (CMD), Quchi (LI11), and the center of the third metacarpal bone
   on dorsum of hand (COT) of the subjects at Brunnstrom stage 3-5 before
   and after IR-C HC, were examined. Meanwhile, EC was measured on Hegu
   (LI4), Quchi and Juanyu (LI15). Pain intensity was evaluated before and
   after treatment.
   Results: Skin temperature increased significantly at the CMD and COT on
   the paretic side in males. In females after treatment, similar skin
   temperatures were found in each measured region on both the paretic and
   non-paretic sides. The EC on the paretic side tended to be higher than
   the non-paretic side before treatment. After treatment, the EC on
   paretic side declined in both sexes and became even lower than the
   non-paretic side in females. Pain intensity was lessened after treatment
   especially in males, which appeared to correspond with an increase in
   skin temperature and a decrease in EC.
   Conclusion: IR-C hot compress is a promising method for stroke patients
   in rehabilitation. Physiological mechanisms of this treatment were
   proposed and summarized from this research.

AB Our understanding of how oxidative stress resistance phenotypes are
   affected by the developmental environment is limited. One component of
   the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life
   oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of
   temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations
   affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in
   red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First,
   to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress,
   eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5
   degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3
   degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature
   fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of
   three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations
   every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the
   influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a
   daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature
   of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C
   (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was
   unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both
   temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature.
   Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations
   had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was
   associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although
   sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by
   developmental thermal environments, potentially because of
   temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences
   in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and
   overwinter survival.

AB Wetland soils are able to exhibit both consumption and production of
   greenhouse gases, and they play an important role in the regulation of
   the global carbon (C) cycle. Still, it is challenging to accurately
   evaluate the actual amount of C stored in wetlands. The incorporation of
   remote sensing data into digital soil models has great potential to
   assess C stocks in wetland soils. Our objectives were (i) to develop C
   stock prediction models utilizing remote sensing images and
   environmental ancillary data, (ii) to identify the prime environmental
   predictor variables that explain the spatial distribution of soil C, and
   (iii) to assess the amount of C stored in the top 20-cm soils of a
   prominent nutrient-enriched wetland. We collected a total of 108 soil
   cores at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in the Water
   Conservation Area 2A, FL. We developed random forest models to predict
   soil C stocks using field observation data, environmental ancillary
   data, and spectral data derived from remote sensing images, including
   Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (spatial resolution: 10 m),
   Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (30 m), and Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (250 m). The random forest models showed high
   performance to predict C stocks, and variable importance revealed that
   hydrology was the major environmental factor explaining the spatial
   distribution of soil C stocks in Water Conservation Area 2A. Our results
   showed that this area stores about 4.2 Tg (4.2 Mt) of C in the top 20-cm
   soils.

AB Aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals, while resting at the water surface or
   ashore, breathe with a low frequency (f) by comparison to terrestrial
   mammals of the same body size, the difference increasing the larger the
   species. Among various interpretations, it was suggested that the low-f
   breathing is a consequence of the end-inspiratory breath-holding pattern
   adopted by aquatic mammals to favour buoyancy at the water surface, and
   evolved to be part of the genetic makeup. If this interpretation was
   correct it could be expected that, differently from f, the heart rate
   (HR, beats/min) of aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals at rest would not
   need to differ from that of terrestrial mammals and that their HR-f
   ratio would be higher than in terrestrial species. Literature data for
   HR (beats/min) in mammals at rest were gathered for 56 terrestrial and
   27 aquatic species. In aquatic mammals the allometric curve
   (HR=191.M-0.18; M= body mass, kg) did not differ from that of
   terrestrial species (HR=212.M-0.22) and their HR-f ratio (on average
   32+/-5) was much higher than in terrestrial species (5+/-1) (P<0.0001).
   The comparison of these HR allometric curves to those for f previously
   published indicated that the HR-f ratio was body size-independent in
   terrestrial species while it increased significantly with M in aquatic
   species. The similarity in HR and differences in f between aquatic and
   terrestrial mammals agree with the possibility that the low f of aquatic
   and semi-aquatic mammals may have evolved for a non-respiratory
   function, namely the regulation of buoyancy at the water surface

AB Background Melanic (dark) morphs have been barely reported in
   peridomestic and sylvatic conditions for Triatoma infestans, the most
   important vector of Chagas disease in the Southern Cone of South
   America. Adults with dark and small yellow markings on the connexivum
   were collected after manual searches conducted by technical personnel in
   62 domiciliary units in Cruz del Eje, Cordoba Province, Argentina. The
   last community-wide insecticide spraying campaign before the study had
   been conducted three years earlier. We investigated if there was a
   measurable color morph variation (melanic and non-melanic) in wings and
   connexivum; we determined infestation, distribution of melanic and
   non-melanic forms, and correspondence of colorimetric variation with
   variations in morphology (wing size and shape and body length),
   development (wing fluctuating asymmetry), physiology (nutritional
   status) or behaviour (flight initiation). Results Forty-nine females, 54
   males and 217 nymphs were collected in 24 domiciliary units. House
   infestation and colonization were 53% and 47%, respectively. Most of the
   T. infestans individuals (83.2%) were collected in chicken coops;
   intradomicile infestation was recorded in only one case. The chromatic
   cluster analysis showed two well-defined groups: melanic and
   non-melanic. The melanic group included 17 (35%) females and 25 (46%)
   males. Peridomestic infestation was lower for melanic than for
   non-melanic adults. Melanic morphs were collected in houses from several
   localities. Sexual dimorphisms were confirmed by morphometric
   measurements. Body length was large in melanic adults (P < 0.01 only for
   males). Differences between groups were significant for wing size and
   shape, but not for weight or weight/body length ratio. Melanic females
   and males showed significantly higher fluctuating asymmetry (FA) indices
   than their non-melanic counterparts. Conclusions This is the second
   report of melanic forms of T. infestans in domestic and peridomestic
   habitats in the Dry Chaco region of Argentina. Although non-melanic
   adults exhibited a higher infestation rate, melanic adults were
   widespread in the area and were collected in the infested domicile and
   in most types of peridomestic annexes. Differences in morphometric
   variables between groups might be due to different ecological
   adaptations. The higher FA levels observed in melanic individuals
   suggest a higher developmental instability and a selective advantage of
   non-melanic individuals in domestic and peridomestic habitats.

AB Various genetic engineering routes to enhance C-3 leaf photosynthesis
   have been proposed to improve crop productivity. However, their
   potential contribution to crop productivity needs to be assessed under
   realistic field conditions. Using 31 year weather data, we ran the crop
   model GECROS for rice in tropical, subtropical, and temperate
   environments, to evaluate the following routes: (1) improving mesophyll
   conductance (g(m)); (2) improving Rubisco specificity (S-c/o); (3)
   improving both g(m) and S-c/o; (4) introducing C-4 biochemistry; (5)
   introducing C-4 Kranz anatomy that effectively minimizes CO2 leakage;
   (6) engineering the complete C-4 mechanism; (7) engineering
   cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters; (8) engineering a more
   elaborate cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) with the
   carboxysome in the chloroplast; and (9) a mechanism that combines the
   low ATP cost of the cyanobacterial CCM and the high photosynthetic
   capacity per unit leaf nitrogen. All routes improved crop mass
   production, but benefits from Routes 1, 2, and 7 were <= 10%. Benefits
   were higher in the presence than in the absence of drought, and under
   the present climate than for the climate predicted for 2050. Simulated
   crop mass differences resulted not only from the increased canopy
   photosynthesis competence but also from changes in traits such as light
   interception and crop senescence. The route combinations gave larger
   effects than the sum of the effects of the single routes, but only Route
   9 could bring an advantage of >= 50% under any environmental conditions.
   To supercharge crop productivity, exploring a combination of routes in
   improving the CCM, photosynthetic capacity, and quantum efficiency is
   required.

AB The dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) is used to project transient
   impacts of changes in climate on vegetation of the Barents Region. We
   incorporate additional plant functional types, i.e. shrubs and defined
   different types of open ground vegetation, to improve the representation
   of arctic vegetation in the global model. We use future climate
   projections as well as control climate data for 1981-2000 from a
   regional climate model (REMO) that assumes a development of atmospheric
   CO2-concentration according to the B2-SRES scenario [IPCC, Climate
   Change 2001: The scientific basis. Contribution working group I to the
   Third assessment report of the IPCC. Cambridge University Press,
   Cambridge (2001)]. The model showed a generally good fit with observed
   data, both qualitatively when model outputs were compared to vegetation
   maps and quantitatively when compared with observations of biomass, NPP
   and LAI. The main discrepancy between the model output and observed
   vegetation is the overestimation of forest abundance for the northern
   parts of the Kola Peninsula that cannot be explained by climatic factors
   alone. Over the next hundred years, the model predicted an increase in
   boreal needle leaved evergreen forest, as extensions northwards and
   upwards in mountain areas, and as an increase in biomass, NPP and LAI.
   The model also projected that shade-intolerant broadleaved summergreen
   trees will be found further north and higher up in the mountain areas.
   Surprisingly, shrublands will decrease in extent as they are replaced by
   forest at their southern margins and restricted to areas high up in the
   mountains and to areas in northern Russia. Open ground vegetation will
   largely disappear in the Scandinavian mountains. Also
   counter-intuitively, tundra will increase in abundance due to the
   occupation of previously unvegetated areas in the northern part of the
   Barents Region. Spring greening will occur earlier and LAI will
   increase. Consequently, albedo will decrease both in summer and winter
   time, particularly in the Scandinavian mountains (by up to 18%).
   Although this positive feedback to climate could be offset to some
   extent by increased CO2 drawdown from vegetation, increasing soil
   respiration results in NEE close to zero, so we cannot conclude to what
   extent or whether the Barents Region will become a source or a sink of
   CO2.

AB The preferential synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to
   thermal stress [the heat shock response (HSR)] has been shown to vary in
   species that occupy different thermal environments. A survey of case
   studies of aquatic (mostly marine) organisms occupying stable thermal
   environments at all latitudes, from polar to tropical, shows that they
   do not in general respond to heat stress with an inducible HSR.
   Organisms that occupy highly variable thermal environments (variations
   up to >20 degrees C), like the intertidal zone, induce the HSR
   frequently and within the range of body temperatures they normally
   experience, suggesting that the response is part of their biochemical
   strategy to occupy this thermal niche. The highest temperatures at which
   these organisms can synthesize Hsps are only a few degrees Celsius
   higher than the highest body temperatures they experience. Thus, they
   live close to their thermal limits and any further increase in
   temperature is probably going to push them beyond those limits. In
   comparison, organisms occupying moderately variable thermal environments
   (<10 degrees C), like the subtidal zone, activate the HSR at
   temperatures above those they normally experience in their habitats.
   They have a wider temperature range above their body temperature range
   over which they can synthesize Hsps. Contrary to our expectations,
   species from highly (in comparison with moderately) variable thermal
   environments have a limited acclimatory plasticity. Due to this
   variation in the HSR, species from stable and highly variable
   environments are likely to be more affected by climate change than
   species from moderately variable environments.

AB During the last century, the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C)
   and nitrogen (N) have been drastically altered by human activities. A
   century of land-clearing and biomass burning, followed by fossil fuel
   combustion have increased the concentration of atmospheric CO2 by
   approximately 20%, and since the mid-1900s, the use of agricultural
   fertilizers has been the primary driver of an approximate 90% increase
   in bioavailable N. Geochemical records obtained through stable isotope
   analysis of terrestrial and marine biota effectively illustrate rising
   anthropogenic C inputs. However, there are fewer records of
   anthropogenic N, despite the enormous magnitude of change and the known
   negative effects of N on ecosystem health. We used stable isotope values
   from independent octocorals (gorgonians) sampled across the Western
   Atlantic over the last 143 years to document human perturbations of the
   marine C and N pools. Here, we demonstrate that in sea plumes delta 13C
   values and in both sea plumes and sea fans delta 15N values declined
   significantly from 1862 to 2005. Sea plume delta 13C values were
   negatively correlated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and
   corroborate known rates of change resulting from global fossil fuel
   combustion, known as the Suess effect. We suggest that widespread input
   of agricultural fertilizers to near-shore coastal waters is the dominant
   driver for the decreasing delta 15N trend, though multiple anthropogenic
   sources are likely affecting this trend. Given the interest in using
   delta 15N as an indicator for N pollution in aquatic systems, we
   highlight the risk of underestimating contributions of pollutants as a
   result of source mixing as demonstrated by a simple isotope-mixing
   model. We conclude that signals of major human-induced perturbations of
   the C and N pools are detectable in specimens collected over wide
   geographic scales, and that archived materials are invaluable for
   establishing baselines against which we can assess environmental change.

AB Ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariants (OsHV-1) cause severe mortalities in
   farmed Crassostrea gigas in Europe, New Zealand and Australia. Outbreaks
   are seasonal, recurring in the warmer months of the year in endemic
   estuaries. The reference genotype and microvariant genotypes of OsHV-1
   have been previously detected in the tissues of apparently healthy adult
   oysters naturally exposed to OsHV-1 in the field. However, the role of
   such oysters as reservoirs of infection for subsequent mortality
   outbreaks remains unclear. The aims of this study were: (1) to identify
   the optimal sample type to use for the detection of OsHV-1 DNA in
   apparently healthy C. gigas; and (2) to assess whether live C. gigas
   maintained on-farm after an OsHV-1 related mortality event remain
   infected and could act as a reservoir host for subsequent outbreaks.
   OsHV-1 DNA was detected in the hemolymph, gill, mantle, adductor muscle,
   gonad and digestive gland of apparently healthy adult oysters. The
   likelihood of detecting OsHV-1 DNA in hemolymph was equivalent to that
   in gill and mantle, but the odds of detecting OsHV-1 DNA in hemolymph
   and gill were more than 8 times that of adductor muscle. Gill had the
   highest viral loads. Compared to testing whole gill homogenates, testing
   snippets of the gill improved the detection of OsHV-1 DNA by about four
   fold. The prevalence of OsHV-1 in gill and mantle was highest after the
   first season of OsHV-1 exposure; it then declined to low or negligible
   levels in the same cohorts in subsequent seasons, despite repeated
   seasonal exposure in monitoring lasting up to 4 years. The hemolymph of
   individually identified oysters was repeatedly sampled over 15 months,
   and OsHV-1 prevalence declined over that time frame in the youngest
   cohort, which had been exposed to OsHV-1 for the first time at the start
   of that season. In contrast, the prevalence in two cohorts of older
   oysters, which had been exposed to OsHV-1 in prior seasons, was
   consistently low (< 10%). Viral loads were < 10(4) DNA copies per mg
   tissue or mu L hemolymph, suggesting that OsHV-1 was not being
   maintained at or amplified to high quantities. Therefore, while OsHV-1
   may persist within apparently healthy oysters that have survived an
   outbreak of disease, they may not be a major reservoir host for the
   virus for subsequent outbreaks. However, further investigation is
   required to ascertain whether OsHV-1 replication occurs in surviving
   oysters, and whether transmission from them to naive oysters and
   induction of clinical disease is possible.

AB Clinal variation across replicated environmental gradients can reveal

   evolutionary processes that shape intraspecific diversity. Using 1773
   genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms we evaluated latitudinal
   variation in allele frequency for 134 populations of North American and
   European Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We detected 84 (4.74%) and 195
   (11%) loci showing clinal patterns in North America and Europe,
   respectively, with 12 clinal loci in common between continents. Clinal
   single nucleotide polymorphisms were evenly distributed across the
   salmon genome and logistic regression revealed significant associations
   with latitude and seasonal temperatures, particularly average spring
   temperature in both continents. Loci displaying parallel clines were
   associated with several metabolic and immune functions, suggesting a
   potential basis for climate-associated adaptive differentiation. These
   climate-based clines collectively suggest evidence of large-scale
   environmental associated differences on either side of the North
   Atlantic. Our results support patterns of parallel evolution on both
   sides of the North Atlantic, with evidence of both similar and divergent
   underlying genetic architecture. The identification of
   climate-associated genomic clines illuminates the role of selection and
   demographic processes on intraspecific diversity in this species and
   provides a context in which to evaluate the impacts of climate change.

   of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars (japonica and indica types) and
   rbcS antisense rice. All plants were grown hydroponically at 25/20
   degreesC (day/night), and then exposed to 20/17 degreesC (day/ night)
   after full expansion of the 8th leaf, or exposed to either 20/17
   degreesC or 15/13 degreesC (day/night) during the expansion of the 8th
   leaf. All plants exposed to low temperatures showed a decrease in CO2
   assimilation rate without photoinhibition, and increases in the fraction
   of thermal dissipation in PSII, and in the electron flux through the
   water-water cycle (WWC) were observed. Although the increase of thermal
   dissipation was associated with increases in the ratio of carotenoids to
   Chl, the ratio of Xp to carotenoids and the de-epoxidation state of Xp,
   the increase of the electron flux of WWC was not accompanied by an
   increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Such photoprotective
   responses did not differ between during and after full expansion of the
   leaf, and did not differ among the three genotypes. Quantitative
   analyses on the dissipation of excess light energy showed that thermal
   dissipation makes a larger contribution than WWC. Thus, although low
   temperature led to a decrease in CO2 assimilation, rice potentially
   coped with the excess light energy by increasing the thermal dissipation
   and the electron flux of WWC under low temperature irrespective of leaf
   development and genotypes.

AB Reef-building corals inhabit high light environments and are dependent
   on photosynthetic endosymbiotic dinoflagellates for nutrition. While
   photoacclimation responses of the dinoflagellates to changes in
   illumination are well understood, host photoacclimation strategies are
   poorly known. This study investigated fluorescent protein expression in
   the shallow-water coral Acropora yongei during a 30 day laboratory
   photoacclimation experiment in the context of its dinoflagellate
   symbionts. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) concentration measured by
   Western blotting changed reversibly with light intensity. The first 15
   days of the photoacclimation experiment led to a similar to 1.6 times
   increase in GFP concentration for high light corals (900 mu mol quanta
   m(-2) s(-1)) and a similar to 4 times decrease in GFP concentration for
   low light corals (30 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) compared with medium
   light corals (300 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Green fluorescence
   increased similar to 1.9 times in high light corals and decreased
   similar to 1.9 times in low light corals compared with medium light
   corals. GFP concentration and green fluorescence intensity were
   significantly correlated. Typical photoacclimation responses in the
   dinoflagellates were observed including changes in density,
   photosynthetic pigment concentration and photosynthetic efficiency.
   Although fluorescent proteins are ubiquitous and abundant in
   scleractinian corals, their functions remain ambiguous. These results
   suggest that scleractinian corals regulate GFP to modulate the internal
   light environment and support the hypothesis that GFP has a
   photoprotective function. The success of photoprotection and
   photoacclimation strategies, in addition to stress responses, will be
   critical to the fate of scleractinian corals exposed to climate change
   and other stressors.

AB Facing climate change (CC), species are prone to multiple modifications
   in their environment that can lead to extinction, migration or
   adaptation. Identifying the role and interplay of different potential
   stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to
   both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river
   water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as
   three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or
   as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based
   demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to
   compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and
   (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the
   evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We
   focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time
   horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not
   lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast,
   the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for
   population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased
   the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but
   river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history
   modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of
   individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature
   rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic
   evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of
   male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven
   plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of
   plasticity going in the opposite direction. We concluded that to
   counteract oceanic effects, river flow management represented the sole
   potential force to reduce the extinction probability of Atlantic salmon
   populations in Southern Europe, although this might not impede changes
   in migration life history.

AB The cardiovascular system plays a direct role in the maintenance of body
   temperature. Whether passive heating alters cardiovascular autonomic
   modulation in conscious rats is still unknown. This study investigated
   the effects of passive heating on systolic blood pressure variability
   (SBPV) and heart rate variability (HRV) in conscious rats and the
   involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the passive heating
   effects on SBPV and HRV. Fourteen male Wistar rats were randomly
   assigned to the control group or the losartan treatment group. A
   catheter was implanted in the left carotid artery to record pulsatile
   arterial pressure (PAP), and a telemetry sensor was implanted in the
   abdominal cavity to measure body temperature (T-boay). After recovering
   from surgery, the animals were subjected to a passive heating protocol
   (35 degrees C; 30 min) in resting conditions, during which T-body, tail
   skin temperature and PAP were measured. The mean arterial pressure,
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, double product (i.e.,
   the product of systolic blood pressure by heart rate), SBPV and HRV were
   calculated from the PAP. SBPV and HRV were analyzed in terms of both
   time and frequency domains. Increases in the thermoregulatory and
   cardiovascular parameters were observed during passive heating in both
   groups, and those increases were reflected in the higher time and
   frequency domains of the SBPV. However, passive heating was not
   effective in altering HRV. Passive heating altered SBPV but not HRV in
   conscious rats when they were treated with losartan.

AB Dengue is a common and growing problem worldwide, with an estimated
   70-140 million cases per year. Traditional, healthcare-based,
   government-implemented dengue surveillance is resource intensive and
   slow. As global Internet use has increased, novel, Internet-based
   disease monitoring tools have emerged. Google Dengue Trends (GDT) uses
   near real-time search query data to create an index of dengue incidence
   that is a linear proxy for traditional surveillance. Studies have shown
   that GDT correlates highly with dengue incidence in multiple countries
   on a large spatial scale. This study addresses the heterogeneity of GDT
   at smaller spatial scales, assessing its accuracy at the state-level in
   Mexico and identifying factors that are associated with its accuracy. We
   used Pearson correlation to estimate the association between GDT and
   traditional dengue surveillance data for Mexico at the national level
   and for 17 Mexican states. Nationally, GDT captured approximately 83% of
   the variability in reported cases over the 9 study years. The
   correlation between GDT and reported cases varied from state to state,
   capturing anywhere from 1% of the variability in Baja California to 88%
   in Chiapas, with higher accuracy in states with higher dengue average
   annual incidence. A model including annual average maximum temperature,
   precipitation, and their interaction accounted for 81% of the
   variability in GDT accuracy between states. This climate model was the
   best indicator of GDT accuracy, suggesting that GDT works best in areas
   with intense transmission, particularly where local climate is well
   suited for transmission. Internet accessibility (average approximate to
   36%) did not appear to affect GDT accuracy. While GDT seems to be a less
   robust indicator of local transmission in areas of low incidence and
   unfavorable climate, it may indicate cases among travelers in those
   areas. Identifying the strengths and limitations of novel surveillance
   is critical for these types of data to be used to make public health
   decisions and forecasting models.
   Author Summary Dengue is a common and growing problem worldwide. Delays
   in traditional surveillance systems limit the ability of public health
   agencies to identify and respond to dengue outbreaks efficiently.
   Internet search queries provide near real-time indicators of infectious
   disease activity and have proven effective for monitoring disease
   activity in some countries, but have not been assessed on smaller
   geographic areas. We compared Google Dengue Trends data for 17 states in
   Mexico to traditional surveillance data from those states. We found that
   the utility of Google Dengue Trends at the state-level is highly
   variable and depends on climatic conditions supporting dengue virus
   transmission. Novel surveillance tools like Google Dengue Trends can
   provide timely information to public health agencies, but to be useful
   on a local scale, they must be considered within the local context of
   dengue transmissibility.

   pod set in soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) genotypes and (b) assess the
   relationships among photosynthesis, cardinal temperatures for pollen
   germination, in vitro pollen germination percentage, canopy reflectance,
   and pod-set percentage. Three field experiments were conducted, and
   Experiment I had HDT between gametogenesis and full bloom (36.5 degrees
   C to 38.6 degrees C) compared with Experiments II and III (29.5 degrees
   C to 31.6 degrees C; optimum temperature). HDT decreased photosynthesis
   (22%) and pod-set percent (11%) compared with Experiment III. Cultivars
   had higher photosynthesis and pod-set percent than plant introduction
   (PI) lines. The cultivars (i.e., IA3023 and KS4694) and PI lines (i.e.,
   PI393540 and PI588026A) were HDT tolerant and susceptible, respectively.
   The decreased pod-set percentage in susceptible genotypes (PI lines) was
   associated with pollen characteristics. Significant positive (r(2) >=
   0.67) association between photosynthesis, cardinal temperatures for
   pollen germination (T-opt and T-max) with pod-set percentage was
   observed. However, a negative (r(2) >= -0.43) association between
   photosynthesis and pod set with canopy reflectance at visible spectrum
   was observed. In vitro pollen germination and canopy reflectance at
   visible spectrum can be used as a high-throughput phenotypic tool for
   breeding HDT-tolerant genotypes.

   enzymes) controlling maximal size and longevity in the blue mussel
   Mytilus edulis L. from geographically separated populations of Northern
   European seas. Mussels from the Barents Sea attain similar maximal sizes
   as animals from the warmer North Sea. Young animals (< 5 y) grow faster
   in the North Sea, however, inshore Barents Sea mussels grow rapidly even
   at advanced age. The slowest growth rates were found in a population
   exposed to strong wave action in the Barents Sea. Respiration rates
   followed the same age dependent pattern in mussels from all studied
   populations with low respiration rates in the youngest specimens
   followed by a rapid increase and then a gradual decline to nearly
   constant values in the oldest animals. When compared at a common
   temperature, metabolic rates only Of Young blue mussels (< 7-8 y) are
   cold compensated with maximal respiration in the most Northern
   populations. Cold compensated metabolic activities in mussels from
   Northern populations may support similar patterns of maximal body size
   and longevity as in the more temperate Southern population.

AB In Drosophila melanogaster male, the last abdominal tergites (A5-A6) are
   completely dark due to a strong internal constraint while, in female,
   all abdominal tergites (A2-A7) are phenotypically variable and highly
   plastic. Male A2-A4 are quite similar to those of female, but their
   plasticity was never investigated. In this paper, we compared the
   phenotypic plasticity of A2-A4 in both sexes in order to know if the
   major dimorphism (SD) expressed in male A5-A6 also extended toward the
   more anterior segments. We also compared two geographic populations
   living under very different climates in order to know if adaptive
   differences, previously observed in females also existed in males. With
   an isofemale line design, pigmentation variation according to growth
   temperature was investigated in the two populations from France and
   India. Male and female data were compared and sexual dimorphism (SD)
   analyzed in various ways. Reaction norms were quite similar in both
   sexes for A2 and A3, but clearly different for A4. Considering the total
   pigmentation (A2 + A3 + A4) males were darker than females at low
   temperatures and either identical to them (France) or lighter (India)
   above 25A degrees C. SD (male-female difference) was genetically
   variable among lines and significantly different among segments.
   Reaction norms of SD exhibited an overall decrease with temperature and
   also a significant difference among populations, suggesting a local
   adaptation of SD to thermal conditions. The three plastic segments in
   male (A2-A4) seem to react adaptively to the thermal environment more
   efficiently than the same segments in female, in agreement with the
   thermal budget hypothesis. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a
   SD trait exhibits an adaptive difference between geographic populations.

   proposed and validated for flu surveillance, to produce near real-time
   estimates of dengue cases in five countries/states: Mexico, Brazil,

AB Culicoides midges are abundant hematophagous flies that vector
   arboviruses of veterinary and medical importance. Dramatic changes in
   the epidemiology of Culicoides-borne arboviruses have occurred since
   1998, including the emergence of exotic viruses in northern temperate
   regions, increases in global disease incidence, and enhanced virus
   diversity in tropical zones. Drivers may include changes in climate,
   land use, trade, and animal husbandry. New Culicoides species and new
   wild reservoir hosts have been implicated in transmission, highlighting
   the dynamic nature of pathogen-vector-host interactions. Focusing on
   potential vector species worldwide and key elements of vectorial
   capacity, we review the sensitivity of Culicoides life cycles to abiotic
   and biotic factors. We consider implications for designing control
   measures and understanding impacts of environmental change in different
   ecological contexts. Critical geographical, biological, and taxonomic
   knowledge gaps are prioritized. Recent developments in genomics and
   mathematical modeling may enhance ecological understanding of these
   complex arbovirus systems.

AB Preservative factors act as hurdles against microorganisms by inhibiting
   their growth; these are essential control measures for particular
   food-borne pathogens. Different combinations of hurdles can be
   quantified and compared to each other in terms of their inhibitory
   effect ("iso-hurdle"). We present here a methodology for establishing
   microbial iso-hurdle rules in three steps: (i) developing a predictive
   model based on existing but disparate data sets, (ii) building an
   experimental design focused on the iso-hurdles using the model output,
   and (iii) validating the model and the iso-hurdle rules with new data.
   The methodology is illustrated with Listeria monocytogenes. Existing
   data from industry, a public database, and the literature were collected
   and analyzed, after which a total of 650 growth rates were retained. A
   gamma-type model was developed for the factors temperature, pH, a(w),
   and acetic, lactic, and sorbic acids. Three iso-hurdle rules were
   assessed (40 logcount curves generated): salt replacement by addition of
   organic acids, sorbic acid replacement by addition of acetic and lactic
   acid, and sorbic acid replacement by addition of lactic/acetic acid and
   salt. For the three rules, the growth rates were equivalent in the whole
   experimental domain (gamma from 0.1 to 0.5). The lag times were also
   equivalent in the case of mild inhibitory conditions (gamma >= 0.2),
   while they were longer in the presence of salt than acids under stress
   conditions (gamma < 0.2). This methodology allows an assessment of the
   equivalence of inhibitory effects without intensive data generation; it
   could be applied to develop milder formulations which guarantee
   microbial safety and stability.

AB Physiological studies focus on the responses of cells, tissues and
   individuals to stressors, usually in laboratory situations. Conservation
   and management, on the other hand, focus on populations. The field of
   conservation physiology addresses the question of how abiotic drivers of
   physiological responses at the level of the individual alter
   requirements for successful conservation and management of populations.
   To achieve this, impacts of physiological effects at the individual
   level need to be scaled to impacts on population dynamics, which
   requires consideration of ecology. Successfully realizing the potential
   of conservation physiology requires interdisciplinary studies
   incorporating physiology and ecology, and requires that a constructive
   dialogue develops between these traditionally disparate fields. To
   encourage this dialogue, we consider the increasingly explicit
   incorporation of physiology into ecological models applied to marine
   fish conservation and management. Conservation physiology is further
   challenged as the physiology of an individual revealed under laboratory
   conditions is unlikely to reflect realized responses to the complex
   variable stressors to which it is exposed in the wild. Telemetry
   technology offers the capability to record an animal's behaviour while
   simultaneously recording environmental variables to which it is exposed.
   We consider how the emerging insights from telemetry can strengthen the
   incorporation of physiology into ecology.

AB By virtue of their cardiovascular anatomy, reptiles and amphibians can
   shunt blood away from the pulmonary or systemic circuits, but the
   functional role of this characteristic trait remains unclear. It has
   been suggested that right-to-left (R-L) shunt (recirculation of systemic
   blood within the body) fuels the gastric mucosa with acidified and
   CO2-rich blood to facilitate gastric acid secretion during digestion.
   However, in addition to elevating P-CO2, R-L shunt also reduces arterial
   O-2 levels and would compromise O-2 delivery during the increased
   metabolic state of digestion. Conversely, arterial P-CO2 can also be
   elevated by lowering ventilation relative to metabolism (i.e. reducing
   the air convection requirement, ACR). Based on a mathematical analysis
   of the relative roles of ACR and R-L shunt on O-2 and CO2 levels, we
   predict that ventilatory modifications are much more effective for
   gastric CO2 supply with only modest effects on O-2 delivery. Conversely,
   elevating CO2 levels by means of R-L shunt would come at a cost of
   significant reductions in O-2 levels. The different effects of altering
   ACR and R-L shunt on O-2 and CO2 levels are explained by the differences
   in the effective blood capacitance coefficients.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human blood are an effective
   biomarker of environmental exposure and are closely linked to health
   outcomes. Unlike VOC concentrations in air, which are routinely
   collected, blood VOC data are not as readily available. This study aims
   to develop the quantitative relationship between air and blood VOCs by
   deriving population-based blood/air distribution coefficients (popKs) of
   ten common VOCs in the general U.S. population. Air and human blood
   samples were collected from 364 adults aged 20-59 years in 1999-2000
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Determinants
   of popKs were identified using weighted multivariate regression models.
   In the non-smoking population, median popKs ranged from 3.1 to 77.3,
   comparable to values obtained in the laboratory. PopKs decreased with
   increasing airborne VOC concentrations. Smoking elevated popKs by
   1.5-3.5 times for aromatic compounds, but did not affect the popKs for
   methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or chlorinated compounds. Drinking water
   concentration was a modifier of MTBE's popK. Age, gender, body
   composition, nor ethnicity affected popKs. PopKs were predictable using
   linear models with air concentration as the independent variable for

AB After more than a half century without recognized local dengue outbreaks
   in the continental United States, there were recent outbreaks of
   autochthonous dengue in the southern parts of Texas (2004-2005) and
   Florida (2009-2011). This dengue reemergence has provoked interest in
   the extent of the future threat posed by the yellow fever mosquito,
   Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), the primary vector of dengue and yellow
   fever viruses in urban settings, to human health in the continental
   United States. Ae. aegypti is an intriguing example of a vector species
   that not only occurs in the southern most portions of the eastern United
   States today but also is incriminated as the likely primary vector in
   historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as New York,
   Philadelphia, and Boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s. For vector
   species with geographic ranges limited, in part, by low temperature and
   cool range margins occurring in the southern part of the continental
   United States, as is currently the case for Ae. aegypti, it is tempting
   to speculate that climate warming may result in a northward range
   expansion (similar to that seen for Ixodes tick vectors of Lyme
   borreliosis spirochetes in Scandinavia and southern Canada in recent
   decades). Although there is no doubt that climate conditions directly
   impact many aspects of the life history of Ae. aegypti, this mosquito
   also is closely linked to the human environment and directly influenced
   by the availability of water-holding containers for oviposition and
   larval development. Competition with other container-inhabiting mosquito
   species, particularly Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), also may
   impact the presence and local abundance of Ae. aegypti. Field-based
   studies that focus solely on the impact of weather or climate factors on
   the presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti, including assessments of the
   potential impact of climate warming on the mosquito's future range and
   abundance, do not consider the potential confounding effects of
   socioeconomic factors or biological competitors for establishment and
   proliferation of Ae. aegypti. The results of such studies therefore
   should not be assumed to apply in areas with different socioeconomic
   conditions or composition of container-inhabiting mosquito species. For
   example, results from field-based studies at the high altitude cool
   margins for Ae. aegypti in Mexico's central highlands or the Andes in
   South America cannot be assumed to be directly applicable to geographic
   areas in the United States with comparable climate conditions.
   Unfortunately, we have a very poor understanding of how climatic drivers
   interact with the human landscape and biological competitors to impact
   establishment and proliferation of Ae. aegypti at the cool margin of its
   range in the continental United States. A first step toward assessing
   the future threat this mosquito poses to human health in the continental
   United States is to design and conduct studies across strategic climatic
   and socioeconomic gradients in the United States (including the
   U.S.-Mexico border area) to determine the permissiveness of the coupled
   natural and human environment for Ae. aegypti at the present time. This
   approach will require experimental studies and field surveys that focus
   specifically on climate conditions relevant to the continental United
   States.
   These studies also must include assessments of how the human landscape,
   particularly the impact of availability of larval developmental sites
   and the permissiveness of homes for mosquito intrusion, and the presence
   of other container-inhabiting mosquitoes that may compete with Ae.
   aegypti for larval habitat affects the ability of Ae. aegypti to
   establish and proliferate. Until we are armed with such knowledge, it is
   not possible to meaningfully assess the potential for climate warming to
   impact the proliferation potential for Ae. aegypti in the United States
   outside of the geographic areas where the mosquito already is firmly
   established, and even less so for dengue virus transmission and dengue
   disease in humans.

AB The net primary production (NPP) is a key indicator for assessing the
   terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes from the atmosphere to biosphere in
   any given ecosystem. Adequate measurement of the sensitivity and
   uncertainty of regional and global carbon pools and fluxes in different
   climatic and anthropogenic regimes is needed to properly investigate the
   terrestrial carbon balance. Remote sensing light use efficiency (LUE)
   approaches can be used to quantify the terrestrial NPP accurately. Using
   LUE models, NPP was calculated for last two decades of an estuarine
   ecosystem, the Sundarban Biosphere region, India. Results from seven LUE
   models: Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), Global Production
   Efficiency Model (GLO-PEM), Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Eddy
   Covariance-Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE), MODerate resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MOD17), Temperature and Greenness (TG), Greenness and
   Radiation (GR) models were compared to ascertain model consistency for
   NPP estimation during the study period 2000-2013. To optimize structural
   biases in the model accurate parameterization and systematic multi
   method assessment were employed. The influence of the input drivers
   (biophysical, bioclimatic and environmental stress) on model
   performances was evaluated. Best model performances were observed over
   cropland, followed by mixed forest and mangrove ecoregion, respectively.
   Amongst all model, ECLUE simulated higher NPP at mangrove ecoregion,
   while the MOD17 model simulated lower NPP in most of the evaluated
   biomes. In addition, TG and GR models exhibited larger unexplained
   variances and found statistically significant at mixed forest site. This
   error was attributed to the absence of environmental stress factors used
   to drive these model. GLO-PEM and VPM corroborate with NPP prediction
   among all LUE models. All seven LUE models predict the statistically
   significant NPP across the biomes and, the poor model performance is
   attributed to the different parameterization scheme executed for
   defining the biophysical and stress variables. Biophysical drivers
   mostly controlled the model performances, followed by environmental
   stress and bioclimatic drivers, respectively. This analysis is
   suggesting that the TG and GR model (driven only by the biophysical
   factors) could be useful in NPP predictions in the regions with no
   meteorological inputs and real-time eddy covariance flux tower
   measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Erythrocytes (red blood cells) play an essential role in the respiratory
   functions of vertebrates, carrying oxygen from lungs to tissues and CO2
   from tissues to lungs. They are mechanically very soft, enabling
   circulation through small capillaries. The small thermally induced
   displacements of the membrane provide an important tool in the
   investigation of the mechanics of the cell membrane. However, despite
   numerous studies, uncertainties in the interpretation of the data, and
   in the values derived for the main parameters of cell mechanics, have
   rendered past conclusions from the fluctuation approach somewhat
   controversial. Here we revisit the experimental method and theoretical
   analysis of fluctuations, to adapt them to the case of cell contour
   fluctuations, which are readily observable experimentally. This enables
   direct measurements of membrane tension, of bending modulus, and of the
   viscosity of the cell cytoplasm. Of the various factors that influence
   the mechanical properties of the cell, we focus here on: 1), the level
   of oxygenation, as monitored by Raman spectrometry; 2), cell shape; and
   3), the concentration of hemoglobin. The results show that, contrary to
   previous reports, there is no significant difference in cell tension and
   bending modulus between oxygenated and deoxygenated states, in line with
   the softness requirement for optimal circulatory flow in both states. On
   the other hand, tension and bending moduli of discocyte- and
   spherocyte-shaped cells differ markedly, in both the oxygenated and
   deoxygenated states. The tension in spherocytes is much higher,
   consistent with recent theoretical models that describe the transitions
   between red blood cell shapes as a function of membrane tension. Cell
   cytoplasmic viscosity is strongly influenced by the hydration state. The
   implications of these results to circulatory flow dynamics in
   physiological and pathological conditions are discussed.

AB Emerging diseases pose a recurrent threat to bivalve aquaculture.
   Recently, massive mortality events in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea
   gigas associated with the detection of a microvariant of the ostreid
   herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1 mu mVar) have been reported in Europe, Australia
   and New Zealand. Although the spread of disease is often viewed as a
   governance failure, we suggest that the development of protective
   measures for bivalve farming is presently held back by the lack of key
   scientific knowledge. In this paper, we explore the case for an
   integrated approach to study the management of bivalve disease, using
   OsHV-1 as a case study. Reconsidering the key issues by incorporating
   multidisciplinary science could provide a holistic understanding of
   OsHV-1 and increase the benefit of research to policymakers.

AB Understanding the variability in organism's immunological response is
   crucial for predicting changes at population or community level. The
   present study investigated the immunoecology of a commercially valuable
   clam Paphia malabarica in a tropical monsoon-influenced estuary. Clams
   were collected monthly during a year cycle, which coincided with
   pre-monsoon (February-May), monsoon (June-September) and post-monsoon
   seasons (October-January). For assessment of immune functioning,
   selected hemocyte parameters (total hemocyte concentration, hemocyte
   mortality, lysosomal content, esterase activity, reactive oxygen species
   production, and phagocytic activity) were analyzed using flow cytometry.
   Simultaneously, clam's condition index, nutrients, chlorophyll a,
   dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and bacterial density were also
   measured at the sampling site. Our results exhibited seasonal patterns
   in hemocyte functioning with the highest activity during the pre-monsoon
   season (suggestive of a suitable harvesting period) and lowest during
   monsoon (suggestive of a critical biological period). The critical
   biological period for P. malabarica was marked with compromised immune
   parameters inflicted by low salinity, food availability, and possibly
   high bacterial abundance. Also, the involvement of reproductive stress
   altering the hematological functioning in P. malabarica cannot be ruled
   out. Nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature could not explain
   much of the hemocyte variability. The present study has further
   validated the usefulness of hemocyte as a suitable marker for
   understanding immunoecology of P. malabarica which is of prime
   importance, especially in a monsoon-influenced tropical estuarine
   environment. The findings of our research will be constructive in
   monitoring natural as well as cultivated bivalve populations of economic
   and ecological relevance.

AB Fossils of chironomid larvae (non-biting midges) preserved in lake
   sediments are well-established palaeotemperature indicators which, with
   the aid of numerical chironomid-based inference models (transfer
   functions), can provide quantitative estimates of past temperature
   change. This approach to temperature reconstruction relies on the strong
   relationship between air and lake surface water temperature and the
   distribution of individual chironomid taxa (species, species groups,
   genera) that has been observed in different climate regions (arctic,
   subarctic, temperate and tropical) in both the Northern and Southern
   hemisphere. A major complicating factor for the use of chironomids for
   palaeoclimate reconstruction which increases the uncertainty associated
   with chironomid-based temperature estimates is that the exact nature of
   the mechanism responsible for the strong relationship between
   temperature and chironomid assemblages in lakes remains uncertain. While
   a number of authors have provided state of the art overviews of fossil
   chironomid palaeoecology and the use of chironomids for temperature
   reconstruction, few have focused on examining the ecological basis for
   this approach. Here, we review the nature of the relationship between
   chironomids and temperature based on the available ecological evidence.
   After discussing many of the surveys describing the distribution of
   chironomid taxa in lake surface sediments in relation to temperature, we
   also examine evidence from laboratory and field studies exploring the
   effects of temperature on chironomid physiology, life cycles and
   behaviour. We show that, even though a direct influence of water
   temperature on chironomid development, growth and survival is well
   described, chironomid palaeoclimatology is presently faced with the
   paradoxical situation that the relationship between chironomid
   distribution and temperature seems strongest in relatively deep,
   thermally stratified lakes in temperate and subarctic regions in which
   the benthic chironomid fauna lives largely decoupled from the direct
   influence of air and surface water temperature. This finding suggests
   that indirect effects of temperature on physical and chemical
   characteristics of lakes play an important role in determining the
   distribution of lake-living chironomid larvae. However, we also
   demonstrate that no single indirect mechanism has been identified that
   can explain the strong relationship between chironomid distribution and
   temperature in all regions and datasets presently available. This
   observation contrasts with the previously published hypothesis that
   climatic effects on lake nutrient status and productivity may be largely
   responsible for the apparent correlation between chironomid assemblage
   distribution and temperature. We conclude our review by summarizing the
   implications of our findings for chironomid-based palaeoclimatology and
   by pointing towards further avenues of research necessary to improve our
   mechanistic understanding of the chironomid-temperature relationship.

AB Background/Aims: To compile a database on content of individual
   glucosinolates in food and to describe the dietary intake of individual
   glucosinolates in a German population. Methods: Studies analysing the
   content of individual glucosinolates in food were aggregated to form a
   database of 26 individual glucosinolates in 18 vegetables and condiments
   consumed in Germany. This database was linked to food intake data
   derived from 24-hour diet recalls of 2,121 participants of the
   EPIC-Heidelberg cohort study. Results: Mean total glucosinolate intake
   (+/- standard error) was 14.2 (+/- 1.1) mg/day for men and 14.8 (+/-
   1.3) mg/day for women. The intake increased with age and education;
   smokers ingested less glucosinolates than never or former smokers. The
   quantitatively most important individual glucosinolates were
   glucobrassicin and sinigrin with mean daily intakes of 3.5 (+/- 0.3) and
   1.7 (+/- 0.2) mg/ day for men, and 4.2 (+/- 0.4) and 2.5 (+/- 0.4) mg/
   day for women, respectively. Broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower
   contributed most to the total glucosinolate intake in this population.
   Conclusions: The established database allowed for the first time the
   estimation of dietary intake of individual glucosinolates. The database
   can be used for epidemiological research on the role of glucosinolates
   in health and disease. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB In this paper, a method for the determination of spatially varying

   The temperature evolution in tissue is modelled with the Pennes bioheat

   ultrasound surgery, in which the tissue properties are needed when the
   treatment is planned. The overview of the method is as follows. The same
   ultrasound transducers, which are eventually used for the treatment, are
   used to inflict small temperature changes in tissue. This temperature
   evolution is monitored using MR thermal imaging, and the tissue
   properties are then estimated oil the basis of these measurements.
   Furthermore, an approach to choose transducer excitations for the
   determination procedure is also considered. The purpose of this paper is
   to introduce a method and therefore simulations are used to verify the
   method. Furthermore, computations are accomplished in a 2D spatial
   domain.

AB In this paper, a model-based optimization method is derived to control
   the thermal dose in biological tissues for ultrasound surgery. The
   optimization method uses the bioheat equation as a system model and
   quadratic cost criteria for the desired thermal dose. Time-harmonic
   quasi-stationary ultrasound fields are used as the heat source. In this
   method the optimal phase and the amplitude trajectories are found
   directly by minimizing the associated cost function. The approach also
   allows for maximum input amplitude constraints. The method is based on
   the Hamiltonian form of the system and results in a large dimensional
   nonlinear optimization problem which is solved with a gradient-type
   iterative scheme. The performance of the optimization method is tested
   with 2D simulations and it is shown that the approach is able to yield a
   feasible nominal solution. This nominal evolution would then eventually
   be sought to be maintained with the help of a feedback controller during
   the actual sonication.

AB Yersinia pseudotuberculosis O:2a harbours 6-deoxy-D-manno-heptose in its
   O-antigen. The biological function of 6-deoxyheptose and its role in
   virulence is unknown and its biosynthetic pathway has not been
   demonstrated experimentally. Here, we show that dmhA and dmhB are
   necessary for 6-deoxyheptose biosynthesis in Y. pseudotuberculosis.
   Their disruption resulted in the lack of 6-deoxyheptose in the O-unit
   and its replacement by D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, thus indicating
   relaxed specificity of the glycosyltransferases, polymerase and ligase
   involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis. The dmhB mutant exhibited a
   lower content in ketooctonic acid (Ko)-containing core molecules and
   reduced ligation and polymerization of the O-unit. We also show that
   Tyr128 is essential for activity of DmhB, and that DmhB functions as an
   oligomer, based on the dominant negative effect of overexpression of
   DmhB Y128F in dmhA. Moreover, we demonstrate that 6-deoxyheptose is
   important for virulence-related functions of the outer membrane and its
   appendages in vitro, such as barrier function against bile salts,
   polymyxin and novobiocin, and flagella-mediated motility. Although both
