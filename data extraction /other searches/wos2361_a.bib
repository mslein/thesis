AB 1. We examined the ability of rubber boas (Charina bottae) to
   physiologically and behaviorally control their heating and cooling rates
   between 5 and 35 degrees C with constrained and unconstrained postural
   treatments.
   2. In both the unconstrained and constrained treatments, heating rates
   were faster than cooling rates (ANOVA; F =. 52.25; df = 22; p<0.001),
   suggesting that rubber boas can physiologically slow their cooling rates
   and/or accelerate their heating rates.
   3. Our findings provide a greater understanding of physiological
   thermoregulation in rubber boas and insight into mechanisms of reptilian
   thermoregulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Broad-scale patterns of heat stress play an important role in
   shaping the geographical distributions of many species and may differ
   from large-scale changes in average temperatures. For species living on
   rocky intertidal shores extreme heat stress occurs when hot dry aerial
   conditions coincide with midday low tides. We used empirical and
   modelled temperature data, and estimates of cumulative aerial exposure
   and solar radiation, in order to test the hypothesis that heat stress on
   Australian rocky intertidal shores decreases with increasing latitude.
   Location Rocky intertidal shores of south-eastern Australia spanning >
   1500 km and 13 degrees of latitude (26 degrees 24'23 '' S to 39 degrees
   07'47 '' S).
   Methods In situ temperature measurements, hourly tidal elevations and
   daily solar radiation taken over three consecutive summers (December
   2009-February 2012) were used to quantify latitudinal variability in
   extreme heat stress, cumulative aerial exposure and solar radiation,
   respectively. Comparisons between hourly in situ temperatures and
   meteorological data were used to produce a large-scale statistical model
   capable of estimating intertidal substratum temperatures during daytime
   low-tides, which was then extrapolated across 22 locations.
   Results Heat stress estimated using in situ loggers deployed across five
   east coast locations typically did not decline with increasing latitude
   and neither did midday exposure or solar radiation. The meteorological
   model proved to be a successful method for estimating rocky shore heat
   stress and in contrast to the empirical data displayed strong
   latitudinal trends in mean daily maxima and cumulative heat stress.
   Modelled acute heat stress (i.e. summer maxima), however, did not
   decline with increasing latitude, as there was greater thermal
   variability at higher latitudes.
   Main conclusions The meteorological model developed in this study
   represents a useful approach for estimating broad-scale patterns of heat
   stress on rocky intertidal shores. Results also indicate that
   latitudinal patterns of acute and chronic heat stress may differ from
   average temperatures, which are commonly assumed to decline with
   increasing latitude. Such broad-scale patterns of thermal stress as
   described in this study will significantly contribute to our ability to
   understand the impact of climate change on vulnerable rocky intertidal
   communities.

AB Thermoregulatory ability and behavior influence organismal responses to
   their environment. By measuring thermal preferences, researchers can
   better understand the effects that temperature tolerances have on
   ecological and physiological responses to both biotic and abiotic
   stressors. However, because of funding limitations and confounders,
   measuring thermoregulation can often be difficult. Here, we provide an
   effective, affordable (similar to$50 USD per unit), easy to construct,
   and validated apparatus for measuring the long-term thermal preferences
   of animals. In tests, the apparatus spanned temperatures from 9.29 to
   33.94 degrees C, and we provide methods to further increase this range.
   Additionally, we provide simple methods to non-invasively measure animal
   and substrate temperatures and to prevent temperature preferences of the
   focal organisms from being confounded with temperature preferences of
   its prey and its humidity preferences. To validate the apparatus, we
   show that it was capable of detecting individual level consistency and
   among individual-level variation in the preferred body temperatures of
   Southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) and Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus
   septentrionalis) over three-weeks. Nearly every aspect of our design is
   adaptable to meet the needs of a multitude of study systems, including
   various terrestrial amphibious, and aquatic organisms. The apparatus and
   methods described here can be used to quantify behavioral thermal
   preferences, which can be critical for determining temperature
   tolerances across species and thus the resiliency of species to current
   and impending climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Although the importance of thermoregulation and plasticity as
   compensatory mechanisms for climate change has long been recognized,
   they have largely been studied independently. Thus, we know
   comparatively little about how they interact to shape physiological
   variation in natural populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that
   behavioral thermoregulation and thermal acclimatization interact to
   shape physiological phenotypes in a natural population of the diurnal
   lizard, Sceloporus torquatus. Every month for one year we examined
   thermoregulatory effectiveness and changes in the population mean in
   three physiological parameters: cold tolerance (Ct(min)), heat tolerance
   (Ct(max)), and the preferred body temperature (T-pref), to indirectly
   assess thermal acclimatization in population means. We discovered that
   S. torquatus is an active thermoregulator throughout the year, with body
   temperature varying little despite strong seasonal temperature shifts.
   Although we did not observe a strong signal of acclimatization in
   Ct(max), we did find that Ct(max), 1 shifts in parallel with nighttime
   temperatures throughout the year. This likely occurs, at least in part,
   because thermoregulation is substantially less effective at buffering
   organisms from selection on lower physiological limits than upper
   physiological limits. Active thermoregulation is effective at limiting
   exposure to extreme temperatures during the day, but is less effective
   at night, potentially contributing to greater plasticity in Ct(min) than
   Ct(max) Importantly, however, T-pref tracked seasonal changes in
   temperature, which is one the factors contributing to highly effective
   thermoregulation throughout the year. Thus, behavior and physiological
   plasticity do not always operate independently, which could impact how
   organisms can respond to rising temperatures.

AB Changes in rectal temperature during mild exercise in the middle of the
   rising (11:00 h) and falling (23:00 h) phases of the circadian rhythm of
   resting core temperature have been compared. Seven healthy males were
   studied at rest, while exercising on a cycle ergometer (60 min at 80 W),
   and during the first 30 min of recovery. Rectal temperature, forearm
   blood flow, and forearm sweat rate were measured at I min intervals
   throughout. During exercise, there were significant time-of-day
   differences in the profiles of all three variables, and in the
   thresholds for increases in forearm blood flow and sweating. Forearm
   blood flow and sweat rate were recruited more rapidly and to a greater
   extent with evening exercise, and rectal temperature rose less. Analysis
   of covariance, with rectal temperature as the covariate, indicated the
   associations between it and forearm blood flow or sweating were
   significantly different (p < 0.05) between the two times of day. There
   were also significant (p < 0.05) time-of-day effects for forearm blood
   flow and sweating that were independent of rectal temperature. During
   recovery, rectal temperature fell more quickly in the late evening than
   late morning. Forearm blood flow and sweating also showed time-of-day
   differences, but these did not co-vary with rectal temperature. Control
   of rectal temperature during exercise and recovery appears to be more
   effective in the late evening than late morning, and differences in
   forearm blood flow and sweating, as well as factors independent of these
   two variables, contribute to this difference. The results support our
   "heat-gain/heat-lossmodes" hypothesis.

AB Future changes to climate in the Great Lakes may have important
   consequences for fisheries. Evidence suggests that Great Lakes air and
   water temperatures have risen and the duration of ice cover has lessened
   during the past century. Global circulation models (GCMs) suggest future
   warming and increases in precipitation in the region. We present new
   evidence that water temperatures have risen in Lake Erie, particularly
   during summer and winter in the period 1965-2000. GCM forecasts coupled
   with physical models suggest lower annual runoff, less ice cover, and
   lower lake levels in the future, but the certainty of these forecasts is
   low. Assessment of the likely effects of climate change on fish stocks
   will require an integrative approach that considers several components
   of habitat rather than water temperature alone. We recommend using
   mechanistic models that couple habitat conditions to population
   demographics to explore integrated effects of climate-caused habitat
   change and illustrate this approach with a model for Lake Erie walleye
   (Sander vitreum). We show that the combined effect on walleye
   populations of plausible changes in temperature, river hydrology, lake
   levels, and light penetration can be quite different from that which
   would be expected based on consideration of only a single factor.

AB Under future climates, leaf temperature (T-l) will be higher and more
   variable. This will affect plant carbon (C) balance because
   photosynthesis and respiration both respond to short-term (subdaily)
   fluctuations in T-l and acclimate in the longer term (days to months).
   This study asks the question: To what extent can the potential and speed
   of photosynthetic acclimation buffer leaf C gain from rising and
   increasing variable T-l? We quantified how increases in the mean and
   variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO2
   assimilation rates, A(net); its variability; and time under near-optimal
   photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this
   aim, the probability distribution of A(net) was obtained by combining a
   probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in T-l with
   data on A(net) responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and
   111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a)
   expected increases in T-l variability will decrease mean A(net) and
   increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean T-l depend
   on species and initial T-l, and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of
   leaf warming, maintaining A(net) at >80% of its maximum under most
   thermal regimes.

AB The effect of temperature on physiology mediates many of the challenges
   that ectotherms face under climate change. Ectotherm immunity is
   thermally sensitive and, as such, environmental change is likely to have
   complex effects on survival, disease resistance and transmission. The
   effects of temperature on immunity will be particularly profound in
   winter because cold and overwintering are important triggers and
   regulators of ectotherm immune activity. Low temperatures can both
   suppress and activate immune responses independent of parasites, which
   suggests that temperature not only affects the rate of immune responses
   but also provides information that allows overwintering ectotherms to
   balance investment in immunity and other physiological processes that
   underlie winter survival. Changing winter temperatures are now shifting
   ectotherm immunity, as well as the demand for energy conservation and
   protection against parasites. Whether an ectotherm can survive the
   winter will thus depend on whether new immune phenotypes will shift to
   match the conditions of the new environment, or leave ectotherms
   vulnerable to infection or energy depletion. Here, we synthesise
   patterns of overwintering immunity in ectotherms and examine how new
   winter conditions might affect ectotherm immunity. We then explore
   whether it is possible to predict the effects of changing winter
   conditions on ectotherm vulnerability to the direct and indirect effects
   of parasites.

   guentheri in order to evaluate the possible effects of global warming on
   this species. We determined the preferred body temperature (T-pref),
   critical thermals (CTmin, CTmax), and hours of restriction and activity.
   T-pref was 32.14 +/- 1.83 degrees C; CTmin was 8.31 degrees C in adults
   and 9.14 degrees C in juveniles, whereas CTmax was 43.28 degrees C in
   adults and 41.68 degrees C in juveniles. To assess extinction risk, we
   used the model created by Sinervo et al. (2010) and predicted that 16.7%
   of populations will have a high risk of extinction by 2020, with an
   increase to 26.7% by 2050. These results suggest that this species,
   despite being able to maintain its T-pref through behavioral
   thermoregulation and habitat selection, could be physiologically
   sensitive to climate warming; thus, the potential for local adaptation
   may be limited under a warmer climate. Further studies focusing on the
   ability of S. guentheri to evolve higher T-pref and thermal tolerances
   are needed to understand the ability of this species to respond to
   climate change.

   on species' ranges in terrestrial taxa and systems, the effect of sea
   surface warming has been poorly studied in marine systems. Here we
   analyse changes in the southern endpoints of distribution of rocky
   intertidal species (gastropods and chitons) along the Chilean coast, and
   trends in sea surface temperature (SST), using data collected during the
   last half-century.
   Location South-eastern Pacific coast, between 18degrees20' S and
   42degrees35' S.
   Methods Past southern endpoints of distribution were obtained for 10
   intertidal species from museum collections and literature reviews.
   Current endpoints are based on field sampling conducted between 1998 and
   2000. Changes in the position of southern endpoints were analysed
   individually for each species, as well as for the entire assemblage of
   species included in the analysis. SST records encompassing 51-57 years
   were obtained from five coastal stations located between 18degrees and
   36degrees S.
   Results and main conclusions Most species (eight of 10) did not show
   expansion of their southern endpoint. The proportion of species
   expanding, contracting or maintaining their southern limit did not
   differ from chance expectation. On average, species showed small
   (1degrees latitude), non-significant contractions, with low rates of
   decadal change (0.18degrees latitude per 10 years). This pattern can be
   explained by changes in SST, which showed a weak warming trend (and at
   some sites even cooling) along the Chilean coast during the last 57
   years. Our results show that different regional warming trends occur,
   and suggest that generalizations about poleward shifts in species ranges
   cannot be made. However, our results support the hypothesis that
   temperature is a major determinant of species range dynamics.

AB Experimental and modelling work suggests a strong dependence of olive
   flowering date on spring temperatures. Since airborne pollen
   concentrations reflect the flowering phenology of olive populations
   within a radius of 50 km, they may be a sensitive regional indicator of
   climatic warming. We assessed this potential sensitivity with phenology
   models fitted to flowering dates inferred from maximum airborne pollen
   data. Of four models tested, a thermal time model gave the best fit for
   Montpellier, France, and was the most effective at the regional scale,
   providing reasonable predictions for 10 sites in the western
   Mediterranean. This model was forced with replicated future temperature
   simulations for the western Mediterranean from a coupled
   ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (GCM). The GCM temperatures
   rose by 4.5 degrees C between 1990 and 2099 with a 1% per year increase
   in greenhouse gases, and modelled flowering date advanced at a rate of
   6.2 d per degrees C. The results indicated that this long-term regional
   trend in phenology might be statistically significant as early as 2030,
   but with marked spatial variation in magnitude, with the calculated
   flowering date between the 1990s and 2030s advancing by 3-23 d. Future
   monitoring of airborne olive pollen may therefore provide an early
   biological indicator of climatic warming in the Mediterranean.

   conditions. Streambed temperature was monitored at the upper and lower
   main river sites at 0.05, 0.2 and 0.4 m depth. Water column temperature
   rose on average 0.6 degrees C km(-1) along the glacier-fed mainstem.
   Temperature was elevated during warmer periods but the downstream
   increase was reduced clue to greater meltwater production (consequently
   a larger total stream flow volume for atmospheric heating) plus a
   proportional reduction in warmer groundwater contributions.
   Hillslope/groundwater-fed tributaries yielded a range of temperature
   patterns, indicating variable sourcing (meltwater or rainfall) and
   residence times. In the upper basin, streambed temperature was warmer
   than the water column, suggesting groundwater upwelling; however, during
   high runoff events, water column and streambed temperature converged,
   indicating downwelling/heat advection by channel water. At the lower
   site, streambed temperature mirrored the water column, suggesting
   greater surface water/atmospheric influences. Key drivers of stream
   thermal regime were: (1) relative water source contributions, (2)
   prevailing hydroclimatological conditions, (3) distance from source, (4)
   total stream flow volume and (5) basin factors (specifically,
   valley/channel geomorphology and riparian forest). High magnitude
   precipitation events produced a contrasting stream thermal response to
   that reported elsewhere. In contrast to European alpine research,
   streams showed a reduced thermal range owing to the relatively mild, wet
   melt season climate. This New Zealand case study highlights the
   importance of understanding basin-specific modification of energy and
   hydrological fluxes for accurate prediction of stream thermal
   dynamics/habitat and ecological response to climatic variability and
   change. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Temperature influences the physiology and behavior of all organisms. For
   ectotherms, which lack central temperature regulation, temperature
   adaptation requires sheltering from or moving to a heat source. As
   temperature constrains the rate of metabolic reactions, it can directly
   affect ectotherm physiology and thus behavioral performance. This direct
   effect is particularly relevant for insects, as their small bodies
   readily equilibrate with ambient temperature. In fact, models of enzyme
   kinetics applied to insect behavior predict performance at different
   temperatures suggesting that thermal physiology governs behavior.
   However, insects also possess thermosensory neurons critical for
   locating preferred temperatures, showing cognitive control. This
   suggests that temperature-related behavior can emerge directly from a
   physiological effect, indirectly as a consequence of thermosensory
   processing, or through a combination of both. To separate the roles of
   thermal physiology and cognitive control, we developed an arena that
   allows fast temperature changes in time and space, and in which animals'
   movements are automatically quantified. We exposed wild-type Drosophila
   melanogaster and thermosensory receptor mutants to a dynamic temperature
   environment and tracked their movements. The locomotor speed of
   wild-type flies closely matched models of enzyme kinetics, but the
   behavior of thermosensory mutants did not. Mutations in thermosensory
   receptor gene dTrpA1 (Transient Receptor Potential A1) expressed in the
   brain resulted in a complete lack of response to temperature changes,
   while mutations in peripheral thermosensory receptor gene Gr28b(D)
   resulted in a diminished response. We conclude that flies react to
   temperature through cognitive control, informed by interactions between
   various thermosensory neurons, the behavioral output of which resembles
   models of enzyme kinetics.

AB Isophya rizeensis Sevgili, 2003 (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae:
   Phaneropterinae) is endemic to the Firtina Valley in the northeast of
   Turkey. This paper describes the spatial distribution and habitat
   characteristics of nymphs and adults off rizeensis within the Firtina
   Valley taking color variation into consideration. Both male and female
   color morphs showed marked differences in spatial distribution with dark
   morphs appearing in the lowlands (between 300-1000 m) and light morphs
   appearing in the highlands (between 1000-2000 m). Both development
   stages (nymphs and adults) were found only in forb/herb and shrub
   vegetation within certain open habitat patches along the Firtina Valley.
   Microclimatic and vegetative properties of different habitat patches and
   behavioral differences oft rizeensis in these different patches were
   also evaluated. Factors responsible for the differential distribution of
   color morphs were discussed in relation to characteristics of local
   habitat patches.

AB Cold tolerance, the ability to cope with low temperature stress, is a
   critical adaptation in thermally variable environments. An individual's
   cold tolerance comprises several traits including minimum temperatures
   for growth and activity, ability to survive severe cold, and ability to
   resume normal function after cold subsides. Across species, these traits
   are correlated, suggesting they were shaped by shared evolutionary
   processes or possibly share physiological mechanisms. However, the
   extent to which cold tolerance traits and their associated mechanisms
   covary within populations has not been assessed. We measured five cold
   tolerance traits-critical thermal minimum, chill coma recovery, short-
   and long-term cold tolerance, and cold-induced changes in locomotor
   behavior-along with cold-induced expression of two genes with possible
   roles in cold tolerance (heat shock protein 70 and frost)-across 12
   lines of Drosophila melanogaster derived from a single population. We
   observed significant genetic variation in all traits, but few were
   correlated across genotypes, and these correlations were sex-specific.
   Further, cold-induced gene expression varied by genotype, but there was
   no evidence supporting our hypothesis that cold-hardy lines would have
   either higher baseline expression or induction of stress genes. These
   results suggest cold tolerance traits possess unique mechanisms and have
   the capacity to evolve independently.

AB Ectothermy in reptiles involves strong environmental temperature
   dependence to maintain body temperature. High mountains are extreme
   habitats which, because of their marked temperature decrease with
   altitude, impose difficulties for reptile thermoregulation, as the
   number of optimum-temperature days diminish in altitude. We studied the
   activity patterns of the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which has a wide
   altitudinal distribution, at six sampling stations that spanned an
   altitudinal range from 300 to 2500 m asl in Sierra Nevada (SE Iberian
   Peninsula). We performed censuses of the species during the seasonal and
   daily activity period, and measured lizard body temperature and
   environmental temperature in the six sampling plots along the altitude
   gradient. The body temperature of the lizards remained closely the same
   even though environmental temperature decreased around 9 C along that
   gradient. Seasonal activity peaked at the beginning of the activity
   period in highlands, but in the middle of the season in middle and
   lowland regions. However, newborns appeared in the field almost at the
   same time along the altitude gradient. We suggest that the
   thermoregulatory strategies of the lizards must vary along this
   altitudinal gradient, permitting lizards to keep their body temperature
   close to a very similar optimum and thus, develop very similar
   circa-annual activity patterns. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In ectotherms, thermoregulation strongly depends on environmental
   conditions, as well as on intrinsic factors, such as skin colour.
   Indeed, due to its physical properties, melanin pigments allow
   melanistic morphs to benefit of a more efficient thermoregulation
   compared to non-melanistic ones. Despite thermal benefits of melanism
   have often been highlighted under experimental conditions, such field
   data remain scarce. In this study, we investigated the influence of
   colouration on body temperature and microhabitat choice in a montane
   population of colour polymorphic asp viper (Vipera aspis) characterized
   by a strong presence of melanism (64%). Results highlighted a difference
   in internal body temperature, but only within gravid females, with
   melanistic individuals having higher body temperatures compared to
   non-melanistic ones. No differences were found when considering both
   sexes. We also showed that melanistic and non-melanistic vipers were
   found in different microhabitat types, i.e. melanistic snakes used areas
   marked by a scarcer sun exposure and by higher vegetation cover compared
   to non-melanistic ones. This result has important implications. Indeed,
   besides providing a possible explanation for the lack of difference in
   body temperature (except for gravid females), it confirms that
   melanistic individuals can potentially use their efficient
   thermoregulation in order to inhabit less exposed and thermally
   unfavourable microhabitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Routine respiration rates in the South Georgia stock of Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) were measured to compare with previously published
   measurements on stocks from colder locations further south. Within the
   natural temperature range of this species (-1.8 degrees to 5.5 degrees
   C), respiration rate data from both the present and previous studies
   were adequately fitted by a single Arrhenius regression (Q(10) of 2.8),
   although South Georgia krill showed an upward deviation from this
   regression between 0 degrees and 2 degrees C (the lower temperature
   range at South Georgia). Metabolic compensation (i.e. the comparative
   lowering of respiration rate) at the high temperatures experienced at
   South Georgia was not apparent, although the higher than predicted
   metabolic rates at low temperatures suggests acclimation of South
   Georgia krill to a warm water lifestyle. Weight-specific respiration
   rate was significantly higher in sub-adults and adults compared to
   juveniles, highlighting the metabolic burden of reproduction. South
   Georgia krill showed no further increase in respiration rate when
   exposed to acute temperatures (5.5-12.2 degrees C), indicating that they
   were already at the limit of aerobic capacity by 5.5 degrees C. Overall,
   this study shows that even small degrees of additional warming to South
   Georgia waters are likely to make conditions there metabolically
   unsustainable for Antarctic krill.

AB Organisms often experience adverse high temperatures during the daytime,
   but they may also recover or repair themselves during the night-time
   when temperatures are more moderate. Thermal effects of daily
   fluctuating temperatures may thus be divided into two opposite processes
   (i.e. negative effects of daytime heat stress and positive effects of
   night-time recovery). Despite recent progress on the consequences of
   increased daily temperature variability, the independent and combined
   effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on organism performance
   remain unclear. By independently manipulating daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures, we tested how changes in daytime heat stress and
   night-time recovery affect development, survival and heat tolerance of
   the lady beetle species Propylea japonica. Thermal effects on
   development and survival differed between daytime and night-time.
   Daytime high temperatures had negative effects whereas night-time mild
   temperatures had positive effects. The extent of daytime heat stress and
   night-time recovery also affected development and critical thermal
   maximum, which indicates that there were both independent and combined
   effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on thermal performances.
   Our findings provide insight into the thermal effect of day-to-night
   temperature variability and have important implications for predicting
   the impacts of diel asymmetric warming under climate change.

AB Studies dealing with the effects of changing global temperatures on
   living organisms typically concentrate on annual mean temperatures.
   This, however, might not be the best approach in temperate systems with
   large seasonality where the mean annual temperature is actually not
   experienced very frequently. The mean annual temperature across a
   50-year, daily time series of measurements at Helgoland Roads (54.2
   degrees N, 7.9 degrees E) is 10.1 degrees C while seasonal data are
   characterized by a clear, bimodal distribution; temperatures are around
   6 degrees C in winter and 15 degrees C in summer with rapid transitions
   in spring and autumn. Across those 50 years, the temperature at which
   growth is maximal for each single bloom event for 115 phytoplankton
   species (more than 6000 estimates of optimal temperature) mirrors the
   bimodal distribution of the in situ temperatures. Moreover, independent
   laboratory data on temperature optima for growth of North Sea organisms
   yielded similar results: a deviance from the normal distribution, with a
   gap close to the mean annual temperature, and more optima either above
   or below this temperature. We conclude that organisms, particularly
   those that are short-lived, are either adapted to the prevailing winter
   or summer temperatures in temperate areas and that few species exist
   with thermal optima within the periods characterized by rapid spring
   warming and autumn cooling.

AB Rockfall is one of the main geomorphological processes that affects the
   evolution and stability of rock-walls. At high elevations, rockfall is
   largely climate-driven, very probably because of the warming of
   rock-wall permafrost. So with the ongoing global warming that drives the
   degradation of permafrost, the related hazards for people and
   infrastructure could continue to increase.
   The heatwave of summer 2015, which affected Western Europe from the end
   of June to August, had a serious impact on the stability of
   high-altitude rock-walls, including those in the Mont Blanc massif. A
   network of observers allowed us to survey the frequency and intensity of
   rock-wall morphodynamics in 2015, and to verify its relationship with
   permafrost. These observations were compared with those of the 2003
   summer heatwave, identified and quantified by remote sensing.
   A comparison between the two years shows a fairly similar rockfall
   pattern in respect of total volumes and high frequencies (about 160
   rockfalls >100 m(3)) but the total volume for 2003 is higher than the
   2015 one (about 300,000 m(3) and 170,000 m(3) respectively). In both
   cases, rockfalls were numerous but with a low magnitude and occurred in
   permafrost-affected areas. This suggests a sudden and remarkable
   deepening of the active layer during these two summers, rather than a
   longer-term warming of the permafrost body. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Increasing temperatures worldwide, as a primary manifestation of climate
   change, may cause substantial alterations in forests, presenting a major
   challenge to predicting responses in forest composition and function.
   Yet, recent empirical research on climate and forests has found patterns
   at odds with theoretical and modeling expectations. Indeed, the need for
   an improved mechanistic understanding of climate's effects on forests is
   clear but controlled field studies that address this issue are lacking.
   Montane and subalpine systems may be particularly sensitive to changes
   in temperature yet quantifying temperature effects in real-world
   conditions can be challenging. We used three common gardens arrayed over
   a 1200 m elevation and 6 degrees C mean annual temperature gradient in
   the Front Range of Colorado to evaluate the temperature responses of
   seedlings of three widespread and dominant tree species in Colorado:
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) and aspen (Populus tremuloides). Seedlings for the gardens
   were sourced from populations naturally occurring at the intermediate
   elevation on this gradient and were planted into identical soils in all
   three gardens. We focused on in situ photosynthetic performance of
   seedlings, plasticity in spring phenology, and adjustments in leaf
   morphology. We found no evidence for clear temperature sensitivities in
   photosynthetic rates of the two coniferous species, neither across a 6
   degrees C range in growing season temperatures between sites nor across
   manipulated leaf temperatures of 15-30 degrees C within sites. Likewise,
   lodgepole pine exhibited uniform leaf size across the temperature
   gradient; however, ponderosa pine leaf size did increase significantly
   at the warmest site. In contrast, aspen displayed pronounced temperature
   sensitivity in photosynthesis and leaf morphology, with maximum observed
   values at intermediate temperatures which both declined at the colder or
   warmer temperatures. Relative to the conifers, aspen also showed reduced
   phenological responses to warming with 12% fewer growing days at the
   intermediate site, and 6% at the warmest site. These divergent responses
   suggest that warming temperatures can alter seedling success in a number
   of different ways, and taken together, are likely to alter forest
   composition of Colorado in favor of greater dominance by montane conifer
   species.

AB To examine whether recent evolutionary history affects the expression of
   Hsp70, the major heat-induced-heat shock protein in Drosophila
   melanogaster, we measured Hsp70 expression, thermotolerance, and hsp70
   gene number in replicate populations undergoing laboratory evolution at
   different temperatures. Despite Hsp70's ancient and highly conserved
   nature, experimental evolution effectively and replicably modified its
   expression and phenotype (thermotolerance). Among five D, melanogaster
   populations founded from a common ancestral population and raised at
   three different temperatures tone at 18 degrees C, two each at 25
   degrees C and 28 degrees C for twenty years, Hsp70 expression varies in
   a consistent pattern: the replicate 28 degrees C lines expressed 30-50%
   less Hsp70 than the other Lines at a range of inducing temperatures.
   This modification was refractory to acclimation, and correlated with
   thermotolerance: the 28 degrees C lines had significantly lower
   inducible tolerance of 38.5 degrees C and 39 degrees C. We verified the
   presence of five hsp70 genes in the genome of each line, excluding copy
   number variation as a candidate molecular basis of the evolved
   difference in expression. These findings support the ability of Hsp70
   levels in D. melanogaster populations to change over microevolutionary
   time scales and implicate constancy of environmental temperature as a
   potentially important selective agent.

AB Avian nests provide a location for incubation, and in many cases rearing
   of nestlings. These energetically demanding activities have meant that
   nest insulation has been the subject of many studies but few to date
   have dealt with how variation among species in nest construction
   materials could affect nest insulation. This study investigated the
   insulation of nests constructed by three species of Old Word warblers
   (Sylviidae), which vary in size and composition. Insulatory values, i.e.
   difference in cooling rate of temperature loggers placed inside and
   outside a nest, and internal cooling rates within the nest cup were
   determined using temperature loggers under still-air and moving-air
   conditions. Insulatory values determined in still-air conditions of a
   laboratory were significantly different among nests of the different
   species but not when the values were determined within the smaller
   volume of a wind tunnel. Moving-air increased insulatory values by an
   order of magnitude but also increased internal cooling rates in all
   species. Insulatory values were positively correlated with the nest base
   thickness. Moving-air increased the cooling rate of the external
   temperature logger much more than the internal logger, which inflated
   the insulatory value of a nest wall in moving-air. Reasons for these
   results may reflect the thermal properties of the materials individually
   or in combination. Future testing of nest insulation should be under
   standard conditions that limit air movement but the role of the nest
   location in situ should be investigated in future research.

AB Distribution and abundance of temperate ectotherms is determined, in
   part, by the depletion of their limited caloric reserves during
   wintering. The magnitude of winter energy drain depends on the
   species-specific capacity to seasonally modify the minimal maintenance
   costs. We examined seasonal variation of minimum oxygen consumption
   between two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton
   vulgaris. Oxygen consumption was measured in both species during their
   active season (daily temperature range = 12-22 degrees C) and wintering
   period (4 degrees C) at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C. The seasonal
   reduction in metabolic rates differed between species and experimental
   temperatures. Wintering newts reduced their metabolic rates at 4 degrees
   C and 8 degrees C in I. alpestris, but only at 8 degrees C in L.
   vulgaris. Both species reduced the thermal sensitivity of oxygen
   consumption during wintering. Theoretical calculations of winter
   depletion of caloric reserves under various thermal conditions revealed
   that seasonal metabolic reduction is more effective in I. alpestris than
   in L. vulgaris, and its effectiveness will increase with the proportion
   of warmer days during wintering period. The variation in winter
   metabolic reduction between sympatric newt species potentially
   contributes to their distribution patterns and population dynamics under
   climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nine healthy females were studied about the time of the spring equinox,
   while living in student accommodation and aware of the passage of solar
   time. After 7 control days, during which a conventional lifestyle was
   lived, subjects underwent a 24-h 'constant routine', followed by 17
   'days' on a 27-h 'day' (9 h sleep and 18 h wake). Throughout the
   experiment, regular recordings of (non-dominant) wrist activity (every
   30 s) and rectal temperature (every 6 min) were made.
   Only the control and 27-h (experimental) 'days' have been analysed in
   the present report. From each subject, 24-h profiles of raw temperature
   (consisting of 240 points) were obtained: one (control days), by
   averaging the control days; the other (experimental days), by conflating
   16 consecutive 27-h 'days'. Activity data were first collected into 240
   points by summing them over 6-min intervals; they were then converted
   into three data sets (each of 240 points) for control and, separately,
   for experimental days, These data sets were summed activities in the
   previous 18 min (A18), summed activity over the previous 18-30 min
   (A30), and summed activity over the previous 30-42 min (A42).
   The raw temperature data sets for control and experimental days were
   separately analysed by ANCOVA using two time-of-day factors: 'hours' (24
   levels) and 'six-minute-intervals' (10 levels). The covariate was the
   three activity data sets; in order to make the analysis more versatile,
   a cubic polynomial model was used, with a linear, quadratic and cubic
   term for each of these activity data sets. Moreover, the effects of
   activity upon core temperature were separately assessed for four 6-h
   sections of the 24-h profile, centred on its low, rising, high and
   falling phases.
   The main results were as follows:
   1. All three activity data sets made significant contributions to the
   model, but that by the A30 data set was the most powerful of the three.
   This supports the use of activity files coveting the previous 30 min in
   other 'purification' methods.
   2. Although the linear term was the one that was significant most
   frequently, quadratic and (negative) cubic terms were also present on
   several occasions. This result indicates that the effect of activity
   upon core temperature can be approximated by a linear function (as has
   been done in other 'purification' models), but that, with wider ranges
   of activity, a sigmoid curve would be more accurate, indicative of the
   process of thermoregulation.
   3. During the experimental days, the effect of activity upon temperature
   was greater in the rising than the falling temperature phase, and
   greater in the low than in the high phase. These results are predicted
   from current understanding of the circadian rhythm of thermoregulation.
   4. During control days, the effects of activity were more complex,
   probably due to the factors that were present at some, but not all,
   phases - factors such as sleep, meals, changes in posture, lighting, and
   so on.
   5. The ANCOVA also enabled the temperature profiles, corrected for the
   effects of activity (and, therefore, to be considered as 'purified'), to
   be displayed.
   We conclude that the use of ANCOVA to tackle the problem of 'purifying'
   raw temperature data is a promising one. So far, it has produced results
   that accord with those from other 'purification' methods and with
   predictions based on our current understanding of the circadian rhythm
   of thermoregulation.

AB Effective thermoregulation is of vital importance since body temperature
   affects virtually all physiological and biochemical processes. Yet, our
   current knowledge in reptilian thermoregulation is largely based on a
   few, well-studied taxonomic groups. This is especially true in Europe,
   where our insights derive primarily from studies on the numerous
   lacertids of the continent. Skinks on the other hand remain understudied
   despite being abundant around the Mediterranean. In this paper we
   examine the thermoregulation effectiveness of the Ocellated Skink, a
   common lizard whose thermal biology has been overlooked, focusing on a
   population from a typical Mediterranean habitat in mainland Greece. We
   recorded body temperatures in the field and the lab and assessed the
   thermal quality of the habitat through operative temperatures. Our
   findings suggest that Chalcides ocellatus is a poor thermoregulator that
   stands very close to thermoconformity. The high thermal quality of the
   habitat allows the Ocellated Skink to regulate its temperature with less
   effort and lower accuracy. This indicates that C. ocellatus may have
   adopted a distinct thermoregulation strategy, most probably due to the
   particular life style of skinks.

AB Polygonum aviculare seeds show high levels of primary dormancy (PD). Low
   winter temperatures alleviate dormancy and high spring temperatures
   induce seeds into secondary dormancy (SD), naturally establishing stable
   seedbanks cycling through years. The objective of this work was to
   elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in PD expression and release, and in
   SD induction in these seeds, and the extent to which abscisic acid (ABA)
   and gibberellins (GAs) are part of these mechanisms. Quantification of
   endogenous ABA both prior to and during incubation, and sensitivity to
   ABA and GAs, were assessed in seeds with contrasting dormancy.
   Expression analysis was performed for candidate genes involved in
   hormone metabolism and signaling. It was found that endogenous ABA
   content does not explain either dormancy release or dormancy induction;
   moreover, it does not seem to play a role in dormancy maintenance.
   However, dormancy modifications were commonly accompanied by changes in
   ABA sensitivity. Concomitantly, induction into SD, but not PD, was
   characterized by a increased PaABI-5 and PaPYL transcription, and a rise
   in GA sensitivity as a possible counterbalance effect. These results
   suggest that dormancy cycling in this species is related to changes in
   embryo sensitivity to ABA; however, this sensitivity appears to be
   controlled by different molecular mechanisms in primary and secondary
   dormant seeds.

AB Understanding variations in individual trajectories is a crucial
   evolutionary issue. Terrestrial ectotherms from temperate regions
   typically face thermal constraints and limited activity periods.
   Developmental conditions (i.e. embryonic life) and reproductive timing
   (laying date) should induce phenotypic variations and influence
   subsequent ontogenetic trajectories (growth and survival). We studied
   these combined influences in an oviparous squamate, the wall lizard
   (Podarcis muralis), comprising a multiple clutch species with natural
   variations in laying date for the first clutch. We experimentally
   manipulated maternal basking opportunities during gravidity (3, 6 or 9?h
   per day) and incubation temperature (23 or 29?degrees C). Early laying
   date positively influenced winter survival in both incubation
   treatments. Survival was significantly lower in cool than warm-incubated
   individuals (14.8% and 73.6%, respectively) because of delayed hatching
   date and reduced activity period before winter. Individuals from cool
   incubation temperature were slightly smaller but had a higher body
   condition and grew faster during the first month of life. Offspring
   behaviour was driven by complex interactions between gravidity and
   incubation treatments. Under cool incubation temperature, defensive
   behaviour was high, independently of gravidity treatment. Warm incubated
   individuals showed low defensive response except when maternal basking
   opportunities were restricted to 3?h. Defensive behaviour at birth had a
   positive influence on survival in cool-incubated individuals. The
   results of the present study highlight the long-term influence of
   hatching date that integrates female reproductive timing and incubation
   conditions. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal

AB Aim: To investigate the species-specific exposure and distributional
   responses of marine fish and invertebrate taxa to rapidly shifting
   climate in the Pacific Arctic, characterized by warming and cooling
   episodes, over the last 24years.
   Location: Pacific Arctic region, eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.
   Methods: We examined the variations in the summer (June-July) habitat
   patterns of 21 marine fish and invertebrate taxa in the eastern Bering
   Sea using multimodel ensemble predictions of species distribution
   between 1993 and 2016. Using ensemble model outputs, we examined the
   rates of predicted (biotic velocities) and expected (bioclimatic
   velocities) distribution shifts across taxa under four consecutive time
   periods of distinct climatic regimes. We then compared these
   species-specific velocity metrics to the rates of local climatic shifts
   (climatic velocities) and quantified the potential lags in
   distributional responses relative to changes in climate across taxa and
   transitions.
   Results: Our analyses showed that individual taxa responded to climatic
   fluctuations at different paces and generally exhibited lags in their
   predicted distributional responses. Subarctic species revealed higher
   habitat sensitivity and exposure to climatic changes than Arctic taxa,
   as they expand their habitat ranges into suitable regions emerging in
   the north under warmer conditions. Importantly, the actual rates of
   climate shifts (climatic velocities) were poorly correlated with both
   the expected and observed shifts in species distributions across taxa.
   Main conclusions: Our findings underpin the importance of incorporating
   species-specific climatic sensitivity and exposure to changes in
   climatic conditions when predicting range shift responses and evaluating
   species vulnerability. These insights are critical for conservation and
   management of fisheries resources in the region.

AB Associations between traits may differ at the interspecific and
   intraspecific levels, making it difficult to predict long term
   evolutionary constraints. In this study we used replicate hybrid lines
   generated from crosses between Drosophila serrata and D. birchii to
   investigate correlations between measures of heat resistance and
   acclimation responses. Within each species, knockdown heat resistance
   was uncorrelated with heat resistance as measured by mortality. In
   contrast, D. serrata was more resistant than D. birchii for both
   measures of heat resistance. Thus, inter- and intraspecific correlations
   between measures of heat resistance differ. In the hybrids, there was no
   evidence for a correlation between knockdown time and heat induced
   mortality. Hybrid data did suggest a trade-off between acclimation for
   knockdown heat resistance and heat resistance as measured by mortality.
   We argue that hybrids between species are a potentially useful tool for
   studying traits such as acclimation responses that show little genetic
   variation within species. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effects of different

   and power output during the Wingate test. Eleven physical education
   students underwent the Wingate test at 08: 00 and 18: 00 h after four
   AWU protocols: control warm-up (CWU), 5 min (AWU(5)), 15 min (AWU(15)),
   and 20 min (AWU(20)). The CWU consisted of 5 min of free pedaling;
   however, the AWU(5), AWU(15), and the AWU(20) protocols consisted of
   pedaling at a constant pace of 60 rpm against at 50% of the maximal
   aerobic power. Oral temperature was recorded at rest, at the end of
   warm-up, and before and after the Wingate test. The temperature has
   improved significantly from morning to evening. However, the increase
   was greater after AWU(15) and AWU(20). The power peak and the power
   means were significantly higher in the evening in comparison with
   morning. These diurnal variations persisted after all AWU durations.
   However, the increase was greater in the morning and in the evening
   following the AWU(15) in comparison with the AWU(5) and the AWU(20). The
   fatigue index (FI) recorded in the evening is statistically higher in
   comparison with those recorded in the morning. In addition, our findings
   show an effect of the AWU durations on the FI. In moderate conditions,
   an AWU of 15 min at 50% of the maximal aerobic power is the best
   duration for the improvement of both core temperature and muscle power
   in the morning and in the evening.

AB This study provides a case history of the impact of the 1998 El Nino
   event on a lake charr population in a shallow (maximum depth = 13 m)
   lake in the southern boreal shield ecozone of Ontario. The lake lost its
   native charr population by acidification from air-borne pollutants in
   the 1950-1960s. A naturally reproducing population was re-established
   through hatchery stocking after the water quality improved in the 1980s.
   The warm years triggered by the El Nino event exposed fish to bottom
   water temperatures of 20degreesC for several weeks and resulted in the
   loss of all hatchery-reared juveniles that were released in 1998. A few
   adults survived the warm years by making use of cold water refuge areas
   (groundwater seepage). This study shows how climate change can eliminate
   charr populations at the margins of their range. It also illustrates the
   potential confounding effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems
   already subject to other stressors.

AB The temperature tolerances of individuals in geographically separated
   populations of a single species can be used as indicators of each
   population's potential to persist or become extinct in response to
   climate change. We evaluated the population-level variation in
   temperature tolerance in populations of several marine invertebrate
   taxa, including bryozoans, tunicates, bivalves, and gastropods,
   separated by distances of <200 km to >5000 km. We then combined
   physiological thermotolerance data with current temperature data and
   climate change predictions to predict which of these populations may be
   most vulnerable to future changes. In a trans-continental comparison of
   four subtidal epibenthic species, we show that populations on the east
   coast of the United States, which experienced higher habitat
   temperatures than those on the west coast, had higher thermal tolerances
   but lived closer to individuals' tolerance limits. Similarly,
   temperature tolerances varied between western and eastern Atlantic
   populations of the mussel Mytilus edulis; however, these differences
   only emerged after repeated exposures to high temperatures. Furthermore,
   the less thermotolerant M. edulis population in the western Atlantic was
   more susceptible to temperature increases, as evidenced by a recent
   range contraction. Thus, for both the subtidal epibenthic and intertidal
   mussel species, we identified the western Atlantic as a 'hot spot' of
   populations susceptible to climate change compared to those in the
   eastern Pacific and eastern Atlantic, respectively. Finally, because
   current tolerances are not the sole indicators of individuals' abilities
   to cope with temperature increases, we also assessed the possibility for
   acclimatization to facilitate the persistence of populations via the
   buffering of temperature effects. We show that, for four populations of
   intertidal Littorina snail species in the northwest Atlantic, most
   populations were able to overcome geographic differences in temperature
   tolerance via acclimation. When acclimation capacity is low, the
   potential for "rescue" may depend on the particular species'
   life-history strategy and dispersal ability. For example, although
   individuals from the coldest-adapted population of Littorina littorea
   were unable to acclimate as quickly as those from more southern
   populations, this species has a pelagic larval stage and, thus, the
   greatest dispersal potential of these littorines. Together, these
   studies highlight the importance of considering variation in temperature
   tolerance between populations within species to improve the forecasting
   of changes in the abundances and distributions of species in response to
   climate warming. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antarctic marine invertebrates from the Western Antarctic Peninsula
   (WAP) are generally stenothermal, with three-month survival and activity
   limits above the average maximum summer seawater temperature (1.0
   degrees C) of 1-6 degrees C and 1-3 degrees C respectively. For many of
   these species to survive the warmer maximum temperature at the
   sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia (5 degrees C), they require either
   greater thermal flexibility, or must avoid the warmest water-masses. The
   mean depths and depth range of WAP gastropod and bivalve molluscs were
   compared with the mean depths of these same species at South Georgia;
   separated into water masses delimited by the 1 degrees C isotherm at
   South Georgia, surface Antarctic water (SAW, 90 m), winter water (WW
   90-150 m) and circumpolar deep water (CDW > 150m). Bivalves in the SAW
   and CDW categories at the WAP were centred around the cooler WW (< 1.2
   degrees C) at South Georgia, with a narrower mean depth range for CDW
   bivalves. There was no difference in the average depth of gastropods,
   but a reduced depth range in the CDW. The apparent temperature limit to
   bivalve mean depths and not gastropods at South Georgia, suggests that
   further latitudinal comparisons could yield information on the
   underlying physiological mechanisms determining the range limits of
   Southern Ocean fauna.

AB The photoperiod regulates the growth and development of many animals. We
   conducted experiments and studied the effect of the photoperiod on the
   growth and development of the larvae and young of two amphibian species
   Rana temporaria and Xenopus laevis. We studied photoperiods: constant
   absence of light - 0 h light/24 h darkness (0L/24D), 8 h light/16 h
   darkness (8L/16D), 12 h light/12 h darkness (12L/12D), 16 h light/8 h
   dark (16L/8D), and round-the-clock lighting (24L/0D). We found out that
   the size of the Rana temporaria tadpoles was the highest with
   photoperiods 24L/0D, 16L/8D, 12L/12D. A decrease in the parameters was
   observed in the absence of light and the photoperiod 8L/16D. The pace of
   development began to differ after the 10th day of the experiment. The
   development was slower with the photoperiod 0L/24D. The highest
   percentage of tadpoles' mortality was observed in total darkness
   (0L/24D), the lowest percentage was observed in the photoperiod 16L/8D.
   The photoperiod had no effect on the Xenopus laevis young. The
   mechanisms of the photoperiod's effect on the larval development and
   growth of amphibians are discussed.

   weeks older tadpoles.
   3. Among 2-week old tadpoles, the southern population tolerated 32 C
   better than tadpoles from other populations. A parallel difference was

AB Antioxidant defence system, a highly conserved biochemical mechanism,
   protects organisms from harmful effects of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), a by-product of metabolism. Both invertebrates and vertebrates
   are unable to modify environmental physical factors such as photoperiod,
   temperature, salinity, humidity, oxygen content, and food availability
   as per their requirement. Therefore, they have evolved mechanisms to
   modulate their metabolic pathways to cope their physiology with changing
   environmental challenges for survival. Antioxidant defences are one of
   such biochemical mechanisms. At low concentration, ROS regulates several
   physiological processes, whereas at higher concentration they are toxic
   to organisms because they impair cellular functions by oxidizing
   biomolecules. Seasonal changes in antioxidant defences make species able
   to maintain their correct ROS titre to take various physiological
   functions such as hibernation, aestivation, migration, and reproduction
   against changing environmental physical parameters. In this paper, we
   have compiled information available in the literature on seasonal
   variation in antioxidant defence system in various species of
   invertebrates and vertebrates. The primary objective was to understand
   the relationship between varied biological phenomena seen in different
   animal species and conserved antioxidant defence system with respect to
   seasons.

AB Heading date is one of key traits in rice adaptation to different
   environments. Rice with early maturity is very useful for increasing
   rice production extensively especially in Indonesia. The improvement of
   rice variety Conde for heading date and resistance to bacterial leaf
   blight (BLB) was developed through Marker Assisted Backcrossing approach
   (MAB). Xa7 derived from Conde as recipient parents for resistance to BLB
   and Hd2 gene derived from Nipponbare as a donor parent for heading date.
   The aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of heading date
   and agronomic traits of 85 BC2F4 lines in two field stations, Sukamandi
   (West Java) and Maros (South Sulawesi). Molecular analysis of Xa7 on
   chromosome 6 and Hd2 gene on chromosome 7 and agronomic performance was
   evaluated. Foreground analysis resulted 41% for Xa7 and 66.7% for Hd2
   gene in homozygous condition. The majority of lines have similar heading
   date and yield with Conde and more resistance to bacterial leaf blight
   (BLB) than Conde. Six lines flowered earlier 5 days than Conde in
   Sukamandi and three lines flowered earlier 3 days in Maros. Twelve lines
   with flowered earlier than Conde, resistance to BLB and similar yield
   with Conde were selected for background analysis resulted 93% genome
   recovery. These lines would be further evaluated in preliminary yield
   trail for their stability.

AB Environmental variation experienced by a species across space and time
   can promote the maintenance of genetic diversity that may be adaptive in
   future global change conditions. Selection experiments have shown that
   purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, populations have
   adaptive genetic variation for surviving pH conditions at the "edge" (pH
   7.5) of conditions experienced in nature. However, little is known about
   whether populations have genetic variation for surviving low-pH events
   beyond those currently experienced in nature or how variation in pH
   conditions affects organismal and genetic responses. Here, we quantified
   survival, growth, and allele frequency shifts in experimentally selected
   developing purple sea urchin larvae in static and variable conditions at
   three pH levels: pH 8.1 (control), pH 7.5 (edge-of-range), and pH 7.0
   (extreme). Variable treatments recovered body size relative to static
   treatments, but resulted in higher mortality, suggesting a potential
   tradeoff between survival and growth under pH stress. However, within
   each pH level, allele frequency changes were overlapping between static
   and variable conditions, suggesting a shared genetic basis underlying
   survival to mean pH regardless of variability. In contrast, genetic
   responses to pH 7.5 (edge) versus pH 7.0 (extreme) conditions were
   distinct, indicating a unique genetic basis of survival. In addition,
   loci under selection were more likely to be in exonic regions than
   regulatory, indicating that selection targeted protein-coding variation.
   Loci under selection in variable pH 7.5 conditions, more similar to
   conditions periodically experienced in nature, performed functions
   related to lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, while loci under selection
   in static pH 7.0 conditions performed functions related to transmembrane
   and mitochondrial processes. While these results are promising in that
   purple sea urchin populations possess genetic variation for surviving
   extreme pH conditions not currently experienced in nature, they caution
   that increased acidification does not result in a linear response but
   elicits unique physiological stresses and survival mechanisms.

AB In fluctuating environmental temperature, homeotherms are able to
   maintain stable their body temperature, which however reveals a rhythmic
   daily pattern as described in literature. Because of the importance of
   body temperature rhythmicity in the knowledge of thermal homeostasis and
   as a means to facilitate the study of biological rhythmicity in general,
   the aim of our study was to assess the influence of two different
   ambient temperature on the daily rhythmicity of body and auricle
   temperature in goat (Capra hircus). For our study 6 female adult Maltese
   goats (18 month old), not pregnant and clinically healthy were used. On
   each subject body and auricle temperature was recorded during two
   different periods, of 7 days each, every 3 hours for 24 hours from 07.00
   to 04.00, at different environmental temperature (1(st) period 18.251.48
   degrees C, 2(nd) period 28.252.05 degrees C). The analysis of the
   obtained result under two ambient temperature indicates the existence of
   a daily periodicity, with small differences in amplitude and acrophase
   between the two studied period, both in body and auricle temperature in
   Maltese breed goat so we can assume that environmental temperature can
   influence in a significant way the daily pattern of body and auricle
   temperature.

AB Thermal heterogeneity provides options for organisms during extreme
   temperatures that can contribute to their fitness. Sagebrush (Artemisia
   spp.) communities exhibit vegetation heterogeneity that creates thermal
   variation at fine spatial scales. However, fire can change vegetation
   and thereby variation within the thermal environment of sagebrush
   communities. To describe spatial and temporal thermal variation of
   sagebrush communities following wildfire, we measured black bulb
   temperature (T-bb) at 144 random points dispersed within unburned and
   burned communities, for 24-h at each random point. We observed a wide
   thermal gradient in unburned (-7.3 degrees to 63.3 degrees C) and burned
   (-4.6 degrees to 64.8 degrees C) sagebrush communities. Moreover,
   unburned and burned sagebrush communities displayed high thermal
   heterogeneity relative to ambient temperature (T-air). Notably, T-bb
   varied by 47 degrees C in both unburned and burned communities when
   T-air was 20 degrees C. However, fire greatly reduced the buffering
   capacity and thermal refuge of Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata
   wyomingensis) communities during low and high T-air. Furthermore, fire
   increased T-bb in Wyoming big sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush (A.
   t. vaseyana) during the mid-day hours. These results demonstrate how
   fire changes the thermal environment of big sagebrush communities and
   the importance of shrub structure which can provide thermal refuge for
   organisms in burned communities during extreme low and high T-air.

AB Geographical patterns of morphological variation have been useful in
   addressing hypotheses about environmental adaptation. In particular,
   latitudinal clines in phenotypes have been studied in a number of
   Drosophila species. Some environmental conditions along latitudinal
   clinesfor example, temperaturealso vary along altitudinal clines, but
   these have been studied infrequently and it remains unclear whether
   these environmental factors are similar enough for convergence or
   parallel evolution. Most clinal studies in Drosophila have dealt
   exclusively with univariate phenotypes, allowing for the detection of
   clinal relationships, but not for estimating the directions of
   covariation between them. We measured variation in wing shape and size
   in D. melanogaster derived from populations at varying altitudes and
   latitudes across sub-Saharan Africa. Geometric morphometrics allows us
   to compare shape changes associated with latitude and altitude, and
   manipulating rearing temperature allows us to quantify the extent to
   which thermal plasticity recapitulates clinal effects. Comparing effect
   vectors demonstrates that altitude, latitude, and temperature are only
   partly associated, and that the altitudinal shape effect may differ
   between Eastern and Western Africa. Our results suggest that selection
   responsible for these phenotypic clines may be more complex than just
   thermal adaptation.

AB Over the last decades, the number of honey bee colonies in the world has
   been declining. A honey bee is the most important pollinator in
   agriculture. According to estimates, such a situation can threaten the
   food security of humanity. The purpose was to investigate the specific
   aspects of the managed honey bee population in Zhytomyr region. The
   population dynamics, number, and density were determined. For this
   purpose the statistics of the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine on
   the number of bee colonies by categories of producers in Ukraine and
   Zhytomyr region were used. It was established that in Zhytomyr region
   over the past quarter century, the population of honey bee (Apis
   mellifera L.) has increased by 2 times up to 193.4 thousand colonies.
   During the same period, the number of bee colonies in Ukraine has
   increased by 1.4 times. At present, Zhytomyr region is a leader in the
   state in the development of the beekeeping industry. Eight percent of
   all honey bee colonies in the country are concentrated here. In the
   Zhytomyr region, the density of honey bee population is one of the
   highest in Ukraine. 82 colonies are concentrated here on one conditional
   pasture area (1256 hectares), with 7 colonies per 100 hectares of land.
   In Ukraine, these indicators are 52 and 4 respectively. The distribution
   of bee colonies in the region is uneven. The vast majority of colonies
   (58.5%) are concentrated in the Polissia. There are from 1 to 18
   colonies per 100 hectares of land in each of the units in the region, on
   the conditional pasture area from 16 to 224. The results of these
   studies are relevant for the commodity apiaries for the rational use of
   honey flow and to make a well-considered decision on the prospect of
   increasing the number of bee colonies. Further work will be aimed at the
   investigation into the melliferous base and the calculation of the feed
   balance of the beekeeping industry in Zhytomyr region.

AB Laboratory experiments on Drosophila have often demonstrated increased
   heritability for morphological and life-history traits under
   environmental stress. We used parentoffspring comparisons to examine the
   impact of humidity levels on the heritability of a physiological trait,
   resistance to heat, measured as knockdown time at constant temperature.
   Drosophila melanogaster were reared under standard nonstressful
   conditions and heat-shocked as adults at extreme high or low humidity.
   Mean knockdown time was decreased in the stressful dry environment, but
   there was a significant sex-by-treatment interaction: at low humidity,
   females were more heat resistant than males, whereas at high humidity,
   the situation was reversed. Phenotypic variability of knockdown time was
   also lower in the dry environment. The magnitude of genetic correlation
   between the sexes at high humidity indicated genetic variation for
   sexual dimorphism in heat resistance. Heritability estimates based on
   one-parentoffspring regressions tended to be higher under desiccation
   stress, and this could be explained by decreased environmental variance
   of heat resistance at low humidity. There was no indication that the
   additive genetic variance and evolvability of heat resistance differed
   between the environments. The pattern of heritability estimates suggests

AB Crop water use efficiency (WUE) has come into sharp focus as population
   growth and climate change place increasing strain on the water used in
   cropping. Rainfed crops are being challenged by an upward trend in
   evaporative demand as average temperatures rise and, in many regions,
   there is an increased irregularity and a downward trend in rainfall. In
   addition, irrigated cropping faces declining water availability and
   increased competition from other users. Crop WUE would be improved by,
   first, ensuring that as much water as possible is actually transpired by
   the crop rather than being wasted. Deeper roots and greater early crop
   vigour are two traits that should help achieve this. Crop WUE would also
   be improved by achieving greater biomass per unit water transpired. A
   host of traits has been proposed to address this outcome. Restricting
   crop transpiration through lower stomatal conductance is assessed as
   having limited utility compared with traits that improve carbon gain,
   such as enhancements to photosynthetic biochemistry and responsiveness,
   or greater mesophyll conductance. Ultimately, the most useful outcomes
   for improved crop WUE will probably be achieved by combining traits to
   achieve synergistic benefit. The potential utility of trait combinations
   is supported by the results of crop simulation modelling.

AB It is well established that elevated sea temperatures cause widespread

   temperatures is most important. Utilizing long-term in situ datasets, we
   calculated nine thermal stress indices and tested their effectiveness at
   segregating bleaching years a posteriori for multiple reefs on the
   Florida Reef Tract. The indices examined represent three aspects of
   thermal stress: (1) short-term, acute temperature stress; (2) cumulative
   temperature stress; and (3) temperature variability. Maximum monthly sea
   surface temperature (SST) and the number of days >30.5 degrees C were
   the most significant; indicating that cumulative exposure to temperature
   extremes characterized bleaching years. Bleaching thresholds were warmer
   for Florida than the Bahamas and St. Croix, US Virgin Islands reflecting
   differences in seasonal maximum SST. Hind-casts showed that monthly mean
   SST above a local threshold explained all bleaching years in Florida,
   the Bahamas, and US Virgin Islands. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The Point Conception, California, USA region (hereafter PC) is one of
   the most important biogeographic and oceanographic discontinuities on
   the US west coast. Here we address how mesoscale oceanographic
   variability in the region around PC affects the growth of the
   competitively dominant species in the rocky intertidal assemblage: the
   mussel Mytilus californianus. Strong upwelling and high wave exposure
   dominate the California coast north of PC, and weak, seasonal upwelling
   and warmer water temperatures are characteristic of the region
   south/east of PC. We hypothesized that the oceanographic gradients in
   temperature, upwelling, wave exposure and productivity around PC would
   exert strong bottom-up influences on growth rates of mussels,
   potentially underlying large-scale differences in community structure
   around the PC region. We evaluated these predictions by measuring mussel
   growth rates across the PC region both in the intertidal and offshore on
   moorings. Intertidal mussels grew at much higher rates at sites south
   relative to north of PC and growth rates decreased in a gradient from
   south to north. The gradient in intertidal mussel growth around PC was
   uncorrelated with inshore concentrations of chlorophyll-a, and was most
   strongly correlated with the alongshore gradient in wave exposure and
   intertidal temperature. Mussels on moorings offshore from the intertidal
   sites grew at much higher rates than those in the corresponding
   intertidal areas, and mussel growth rates did not differ significantly
   among moored locations around PC. The gradient of increasing temperature
   from north to south among mooring sites was correlated with a decreasing
   gradient in productivity in the same direction, potentially contributing
   to equal and opposite effects on mussel growth at offshore moorings.
   This study suggests that environmental factors such as cold temperatures
   and high wave exposure contribute to the spatial pattern of decreasing
   mussel growth rates from south to north around PC, underlying
   large-scale patterns of community structure in this region. (c) 2006

AB Ectotherms are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate
   warming. Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in
   climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions.
   Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are
   exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we
   highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate realized' thermal
   reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the fundamental' norms derived
   under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model
   organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes
   such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under
   cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum
   temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial
   insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should
   alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing thermal
   safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have
   generally been ignored in the climate change literature.

AB Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and
   behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows
   animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical
   to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor
   performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer
   questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral
   thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly
   constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few
   studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a
   majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day
   within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the
   night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even
   at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through
   conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated
   the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian
   house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a
   thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry,
   in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained
   using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from
   31.4 +/- 0.59-34.5 +/- 0.55 degrees C in a laboratory thermal gradient.
   In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators
   than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare,
   warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than
   most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective
   thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures
   are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The
   ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for
   nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is
   reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to
   understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species
   may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures.

AB Insects can adapt to temperate environments by increasing levels of
   resistance to cold conditions over winter and/or altering reproductive
   patterns to focus reproduction in favourable conditions. In temperate
   areas, Drosophila melanogaster persists over winter at the adult stage.
   A previous experiment, conducted with flies kept in outdoor population
   cages in the temperate winter, indicated that temperate populations
   produced more eggs than did tropical populations following an abrupt
   increase in reproduction in late winter. In contrast, the tropical
   populations produced more eggs prior to the increase. Both patterns
   resulted in a higher net number of surviving offspring for temperate
   populations. Here we again examine the clinal pattern in reproduction
   using outdoor cages, this time held under tropical winter conditions. In
   this environment, surprisingly, egg production was higher and on average
   earlier in populations originating from temperate areas. However,
   mortality rates also increased with latitude of origin, and the
   relationship of lifetime egg production to latitude should therefore be
   measured. To test the role of altered pattern of egg production per se
   in the reproductive advantage of temperate populations in the temperate
   winter, we tested the performance of laboratory lines selected for
   altered reproductive patterns, under temperate winter conditions. Lines
   selected for high early fecundity exhibited this characteristic in the
   field cages and lines selected for late reproduction exhibited a
   relatively high fecundity in spring. The timing of the abrupt increase
   in egg production was identical in these sets of lines and occurred at
   the same time in recently collected populations, suggesting evolutionary
   conservation of the switch. These findings suggest that changes in early
   and late reproduction per se determine adaptation to temperate winter
   conditions, and illustrate how laboratory selection lines can be used to
   understand traits underlying adaptive shifts in field performance.

AB Standard cognitive measures are often applied at various times of the
   day to assess cognitive deficits in patients with neuropsychiatric and
   neurodegenerative disorders, irrespective of their chronotype. In this
   study, we aimed to determine whether the subjectively nonpreferred time
   of an assessment might be a crucial factor in persons with extreme
   chronotypes. We compared morning (08:00) and evening (20:00) cognitive
   performance in extreme morning, extreme evening, and intermediate
   chronotypes determined by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire,
   supported by actigraphy and peripheral temperature measurement. The
   assessment sessions were performed in pseudorandom order over two
   consecutive weekend days. We administered the commonly used test battery
   for neurocognitive assessment comprised of tasks aimed mainly at
   attention, processing speed, working memory, and declarative memory. The
   time of assessment influenced the declarative memory measures, whereas
   the chronotype-specific differences occurred only in the Stroop
   colour-naming subtest aimed at processing speed. The observed effects
   should be considered in routine clinical practice because they might
   cause misrepresentation of the results obtained during improperly timed
   cognitive assessment. Our results also point towards similarity of doves
   and owls in contrast to larks in cognitive performance, suggesting that
   early morning assessments should also be considered in cases of
   intermediate chronotypes.

AB The study evaluated the effects of graded levels of Bactofort (R) on
   cloacal temperature fluctuations in broiler chickens during the cold-dry
   season. Complete randomised sampling was used to assign 225 broiler
   chicks into 5 groups with 3 replicates. The broiler chicks from Group I
   were fed a basal diet without Bactofort (R) supplementation, Group II
   0.25 g of Bactofort (R) per kg of feed, Group III 0.35 g of Bactofort
   (R) per kg of feed, Group IV 0.45 g of Bactofort (R) per kg of feed and
   Group V were fed 0.55 g of Bactofort (R) per kg of feed. Beginning from
   day old, the treatment groups were fed with Bactofort (R)
   supplementation daily for 6 weeks. Dry-bulb temperature (DBT), relative
   humidity (RH) and temperature-humidity index (THI) inside the pen and
   cloacal temperature of each broiler chick were obtained hourly over a
   12-h period from 06:00 to 18:00 h (GMT + 1), on days 28 and 42 of the
   study. Mean values of DBT (32.00 +/- 0.42 degrees C), THI (29.55 +/-
   0.60) and RH (43.27 +/- 0.79%) obtained inside the poultry house were
   outside the thermoneutral zone for broiler chickens, and suggestive of
   thermal stress. The administration of Bactofort (R) in the treatment
   groups decreased the mean and amplitude and increased the robustness of
   cloacal temperature on days 28 and 42. Overall, the mean of cloacal
   temperature in the control group (42.00 +/- 0.20 degrees C) was higher
   (P < 0.0001) than those of the Bactofort (R)-treated groups at the
   dosages of 0.25 g/kg (41.06 +/- 0.15 degrees C), 0.35 g/kg (40.94 +/-
   0.10 degrees C), 0.45 g/kg (40.92 +/- 0.08 degrees C) and 0.55 g/kg
   (40.80 +/- 0.09 degrees C). In conclusion, Bactofort (R) administration
   stabilised cloacal temperature of broiler chicken on days 28 and 42 by
   decreasing its values. The use of the probiotic may be beneficial in
   modulating diurnal rhythm of cloacal temperature and reducing adverse
   effects of thermal stress on broiler chickens.

AB Late Cenozoic bivalve extinction in the North Atlantic area has been
   attributed to environmental deterioration. Within scallops and oysters -
   groups with a high growth rate - certain taxa which grew exceptionally
   fast became extinct, while others which grew slower survived. Those
   which grew exceptionally fast would have obtained protection from
   predators thereby, so their extinction may have been due to the
   detrimental effect of environmental change on growth rate and ability to
   avoid predation, rather than environmental change per se. We
   investigated some glycymeridid and carditid bivalves - groups with a low
   growth rate - to see whether extinct forms grew faster than extant
   forms. Extinct Glycymeris subovata grew at about the same rate as the
   slowest-growing living glycymeridid and much slower than late Cenozoic
   examples of extant G. americana, which grew at about the same rate as
   the fastest-growing living glycymeridid. Extinct G. obovata and extinct
   Cardites squamulosa ampla also grew slower than G. americana. These
   findings indicate that within bivalve groups with a low growth rate,
   extinction or survival of taxa through the late Cenozoic was not
   influenced by whether they were relatively fast or slow growers. By
   implication, environmental change acted directly to cause extinctions in
   these groups.

AB Diverse biochemical and physiological adaptations enable different
   species of ectotherms to survive and reproduce in very different
   temperature regimes, but whether these adaptations fully compensate for
   the thermodynamically depressing effects of low temperature on rates of
   biological processes is debated. If such adaptations are fully
   compensatory, then temperature-dependent processes (e.g., digestion
   rate, population growth rate) of cold-adapted species will match those
   of warm-adapted species when each is measured at its own optimal
   temperature. Here we show that cold-adapted insect species have much
   lower maximum rates of population growth than do warm-adapted species,
   even when we control for phylogenetic relatedness. This pattern also
   holds when we use a structural-equation model to analyze alternative
   hypotheses that might otherwise explain this correlation. Thus, although
   physiological adaptations enable some insects to survive and reproduce
   at low temperatures, these adaptations do not overcome the "tyranny" of
   thermodynamics, at least for rates of population increase. Indeed, the
   sensitivity of population growth rates of insects to temperature is even
   greater than predicted by a recent thermodynamic model. Our findings
   suggest that adaptation to temperature inevitably alters the population
   dynamics of insects. This result has broad evolutionary and ecological
   consequences.

AB Males and females from several animal taxa differ in locomotor
   performance traits such as sprinting and jumping. These performance
   dimorphisms may be explained at least partially by sexual differences in
   physiology or morphology. In ectotherms such as reptiles, however,
   thermal ecology places an additional constraint on realized locomotor
   performance. I review recent studies on reptiles examining sexual
   differences in locomotor capacity and related thermoregulatory behavior,
   and discuss potential causes, constraints, and selective pressures that
   might drive intersexual divergence in capacity for locomotor performance
   in reptiles. In several cases where such differences occur, sexual
   dimorphisrns in body size do not account for all the observed variation
   in performance. However, while sex-specific locomotor capacities might
   be evident in the laboratory, ecological performance in nature is likely
   the result of complex interactions among sex, thermal sensitivity,
   habitat type, and behavioral locomotor compensation. Results from
   laboratory studies of dimorphisms in maximum locomotor capacity are
   therefore likely to be poor predictors of realized ecological
   differences in performance. Nonetheless, sex differences in performance
   are potentially important modifiers of male and female behavioral
   strategies and overall fitness, and consequently are deserving of more
   attention than they have thus far received.

AB Synopsis Over the last few decades, biologists have made substantial
   progress in understanding relationships between changing climates and
   organism performance. Much of this work has focused on temperature
   because it is the best kept of climatic records, in many locations it is
   predicted to keep rising into the future, and it has profound effects on
   the physiology, performance, and ecology of organisms, especially
   ectothermic organisms which make up the vast majority of life on Earth.
   Nevertheless, much of the existing literature on temperature-organism
   interactions relies on mean temperatures. In reality, most organisms do
   not directly experience mean temperatures; rather, they experience
   variation in temperature over many time scales, from seconds to years.
   We propose to shift the focus more directly on patterns of temperature
   variation, rather than on means per se, and present a framework both for
   analyzing temporal patterns of temperature variation and for
   incorporating those patterns into predictions about organismal biology.
   In particular, we advocate using the Fourier transform to decompose
   temperature time series into their component sinusoids, thus allowing
   transformations between the time and frequency domains. This approach
   provides (1) standardized ways of visualizing the contributions that
   different frequencies make to total temporal variation; (2) the ability
   to assess how patterns of temperature variation have changed over the
   past half century and may change into the future; and (3) clear
   approaches to manipulating temporal time series to ask "what if"
   questions about the potential effects of future climates. We first
   summarize global patterns of change in temperature variation over the
   past 40 years; we find meaningful changes in variation at the half day
   to yearly times scales. We then demonstrate the utility of the Fourier
   framework by exploring how power added to different frequencies alters
   the overall incidence of long-term waves of high and low temperatures,
   and find that power added to the lowest frequencies greatly increases
   the probability of long-term heat and cold waves. Finally, we review
   what is known about the time scales over which organismal thermal
   performance curves change in response to variation in the thermal
   environment. We conclude that integrating information characterizing
   both the frequency spectra of temperature time series and the time
   scales of resulting physiological change offers a powerful new avenue
   for relating climate, and climate change, to the future performance of
   ectothermic organisms.

AB Salmonella has been shown to survive in tree nuts over long periods of
   time. This survival capacity and its variability are key elements for
   risk assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts. The aim of-this study was to
   develop a mathematical model to predict survival of Salmonella in tree
   nuts at ambient storage temperatures that considers variability and
   uncertainty separately and can easily be incorporated into a risk
   assessment model. Data on Salmonella survival on raw almonds, pecans,
   pistachios and walnuts were collected from the peer reviewed literature.
   The Weibull model was chosen as the baseline model and various fixed
   effect and mixed effect models were fit to the data. The best model
   identified through statistical analysis testing was then used to develop
   a hierarchical Bayesian model. Salmonella in tree nuts showed slow
   declines at temperatures ranging from 21 degrees C to 24 degrees C. A
   high degree of variability in survival was observed across tree nut
   studies reported in the literature. Statistical analysis results
   indicated that the best applicable model was a mixed effect model that
   included a fixed and random variation of 5 per tree nut (which is the
   time it takes for the first log(10) reduction) and a fixed variation of
   rho per tree nut (parameter which defines the shape of the curve).
   Higher estimated survival rates (6) were obtained for Salmonella on
   pistachios, followed in decreasing order by pecans, almonds and walnuts.
   The posterior distributions obtained from Bayesian inference were used
   to estimate the variability in the log(10) decrease levels in survival
   for each tree nut, and the uncertainty of these estimates. These modeled
   uncertainty and variability distributions of the estimates can be used
   to obtain a complete exposure assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts when
   including time-temperature parameters for storage and consumption data.
   The statistical approach presented in this study may be applied to any
   studies that aim to develop predictive models to be implemented in a
   probabilistic exposure assessment or a quantitative microbial risk
   assessment. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article

AB In the Midriff Islands region (MIR) of the Gulf of California (Mexico),
   tidal mixing plays a very important role in the distribution of chemical
   properties. Although the temporal variability of the water masses is
   linked to the ocean dynamics of this region, its importance has not been
   considered. This work estimates the effect of water mass dynamics on the
   spatial distribution and seasonal variation of dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) in the region, with special emphasis on the Ballenas
   Channel, during winter 2002, spring 2003, and summer 2004. Gulf of
   California Water (GCW) was found throughout the area in the first 100 m.
   Below, Subtropical Subsurface Water (SSW) filled the Delfin,
   Salsipuedes, and Tiburon basins, while to the southeast it was found
   between 150 and 350 m. Pacific Intermediate Water did not cross the
   sills. SSW enriches the surface water of the MIR with DIC when it
   increases in volume and when mixed with GCW by tidal effects. This
   contribution decreases towards summertime, when SSW sinks and the volume
   of GCW increases. In winter, GCW had three water types associated with
   oceanographic mixing processes and in combination with the presence of
   SSW. There was a strong DIC vs temperature relationship, which can be
   applied to analyze the carbon dynamics in the MW, both at the surface
   using satellite imagery and vertically to simulate physical processes.

AB Illumination and light spectrum have the most diverse effects on
   animals. However, their role in the development of amphibian larvae has
   been little studied. This study is aimed to study the effects of
   illumination and light spectrum on the growth and development of
   Pelophylax ridibundus larvae. The study has been conducted in
   experimental conditions. Roe has been obtained from a natural reservoir
   from one clutch. The larvae have been placed in aquariums and had been
   grown before the appearance of juveniles under illumination from 0 to
   2400 lx in different spectrum colours (from red to blue). It has turned
   out that a wide range of illumination (from 3 to 2400 lx) has a positive
   effect. On the contrary, the larvae mortality and the duration of the
   larval development and metamorphosis climax increased in conditions of
   round-the-clock darkness. The tadpoles growth increases while the
   duration of the larval development reduces compared to the control
   (normal lighting) under blue light. The length and mass of the larvae
   decrease under red illumination compared with the control. Mechanisms of
   the possible light influence on Pelophylax ridibundus are discussed.

AB In a recent publication, Hawes and Bale provide an extended discussion
   of phenotypic plasticity in the context of low temperature responses of
   animals. They argue that phenotypic plasticity may be partitioned
   phylogenetically at several levels and go on to explore these levels,
   and cold hardiness strategies that they term cryotypes, which in their
   view constitute cryotypic plasticity. Here we argue that this attempt to
   partition plasticity is misleading, that the term. genotypic plasticity'
   is potentially highly confusing and a misnomer for physiological
   variance, and that the term 'superplasticity' should not be used. We
   also show that a definition of strategies as cryotypes is not useful and
   that the hypothesis about the relationship between evolutionary
   derivation and extent of plasticity in freeze-avoiding vs
   freeze-tolerant species is not supported by current evidence.

AB The cellular stress response (CSR) is critical for enabling organisms to
   cope with thermal damage to proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. It
   is a graded response whose properties vary with the degree of cellular
   damage. Molecular damage has positive, as well as negative,
   function-perturbing effects. Positive effects include crucial regulatory
   interactions that orchestrate involvement of the different components of
   the CSR. Thermally unfolded proteins signal for rapid initiation of
   transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), central
   elements of the heat shock response (HSR). Thermal disruption of
   messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structures in untranslated regions leads
   to the culling of the mRNA pool: thermally labile mRNAs for housekeeping
   proteins are degraded by exonucleases; heat-resistant mRNAs for stress
   proteins like HSPs then can monopolize the translational apparatus.
   Thus, proteins and RNA function as "cellular thermometers," and evolved
   differences in their thermal stabilities enable rapid initiation of the
   CSR whenever cell temperature rises significantly above the normal
   thermal range of a species. Covalent DNA damage, which may result from
   increased production of reactive oxygen species, is
   temperature-dependent; its extent may determine cellular survival. High
   levels of stress that exceed capacities for molecular repair can lead to
   proteolysis, inhibition of cell division, and programmed cell death
   (apoptosis). Onset of these processes may occur later in the stress
   period, after initiation of the HSR, to allow HSPs opportunity to
   restore protein homeostasis. Delay of these energy costly processes may
   also result from shortfalls in availability of adenosine triphosphate
   and reducing power during times of peak stress.

AB Small birds inhabiting northern temperate and boreal latitudes typically
   increase metabolic rates during cold winters or acclimation to low air
   temperatures (T-accl). Recent studies suggest considerable variation in
   patterns of seasonal metabolic acclimatization in birds from subtropical
   and tropical regions with milder winters, but there remains a dearth of
   acclimation studies investigating metabolic flexibility among
   lower-latitude birds. We used short-term thermal acclimation experiments
   to investigate phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR),
   thermoneutral evaporative water loss (EWL) and summit metabolism (M-sum)
   in three populations of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser
   mahali) along a climatic and aridity gradient. We allocated individuals
   to one of three Taccl treatments (5, 20 and 35 degrees C; n=11 per
   population per T-accl) for 28 days, and measured post-acclimation BMR,
   EWL and Msum using flow-through respirometry. Our data reveal the
   expected pattern of lower BMR and EWL (similar to 12% and 25% lower,
   respectively) in birds at T-accl=35 degrees C compared with cooler
   T-accl treatments, as observed in previous acclimation studies on
   subtropical birds. We found no variation in the reaction norms of BMR
   and EWL among populations in response to acclimation, suggesting
   previously documented differences in seasonal BMR acclimatization are
   the result of phenotypic flexibility. In contrast to higher-latitude
   species, M-sum did not significantly vary in response to thermal
   acclimation. These findings support the idea that factors other than
   enhancing cold tolerance may be driving patterns of metabolic variation
   in subtropical birds.

AB There is pressing urgency to understand how tropical ectotherms can
   behaviorally and physiologically respond to climate warming. We examine
   how basking behavior and thermal environment interact to influence
   evolutionary variation in thermal physiology of multiple species of
   lygosomine rainforest skinks from the Wet Tropics of northeastern
   Queensland, Australia (AWT). These tropical lizards are behaviorally
   specialized to exploit canopy or sun, and are distributed across marked
   thermal clines in the AWT. Using phylogenetic analyses, we demonstrate
   that physiological parameters are either associated with changes in
   local thermal habitat or to basking behavior, but not both. Cold
   tolerance, the optimal sprint speed, and performance breadth are
   primarily influenced by local thermal environment. Specifically, montane
   lizards are more cool tolerant, have broader performance breadths, and
   higher optimum sprinting temperatures than their lowland counterparts.
   Heat tolerance, in contrast, is strongly affected by basking behavior:
   there are two evolutionary optima, with basking species having
   considerably higher heat tolerance than shade skinks, with no effect of
   elevation. These distinct responses among traits indicate the multiple
   selective pressures and constraints that shape the evolution of thermal
   performance. We discuss how behavior and physiology interact to shape
   organisms' vulnerability and potential resilience to climate change.

AB Regulation of body temperature may increase fitness of animals by
   ensuring that biochemical and physiological processes proceed at an
   optimal rate. The validity of current methods of testing whether or not
   thermoregulation in reptiles occurs is often limited to very small
   species that have near zero heat capacity. The aim of this study was to
   develop a method that allows estimation of body temperature null
   distributions of large reptiles and to investigate seasonal
   thermoregulation in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).
   Continuous body temperature records of wild alligators were obtained
   from implanted dataloggers in winter (n = 7, mass range: 1.6-53.6 kg)
   and summer (n = 7, mass range: 1.9-54.5 kg). Body temperature null
   distributions were calculated by randomising behavioural postures,
   thereby randomly altering relative animal surface areas exposed to
   different avenues of heat transfer. Core body temperatures were
   predicted by calculations of transient heat transfer by conduction and
   blood flow. Alligator body temperatures follow regular oscillations
   during the day. Occasionally, body temperature steadied during the day
   to fall within a relatively narrow range. Rather than indicating
   shuttling thermoregulation, however, this pattern could be predicted
   from random movements. Average daily body temperature increases with
   body mass in winter but not in summer. Daily amplitudes of body
   temperature decrease with increasing body mass in summer but not in
   winter. These patterns result from differential exposure to heat
   transfer mechanisms at different seasons. In summer, alligators are
   significantly cooler than predictions for a randomly moving animal, and
   the reverse is the case in winter. Theoretical predictions show,
   however, that alligators can be warmer in winter if they maximised their
   sun exposure. We concluded that alligators may not rely exclusively on
   regulation of body temperature but that they may also acclimatise
   biochemically to seasonally changing environmental conditions.

   traits at interspecific as well as intraspecific levels provide an
   opportunity to comprehend the adaptive divergence acquired in the
   closely related species among different geographical populations. In the
   present study, we investigated the geographical differences for basal as
   well as induced thermal tolerance (hardening) in two sympatric sibling
   Drosophila species (D. leontia and D. kikkawai) along a latitudinal
   transect (South: 8A degrees 06'N to North: 32A degrees 40'N) across
   India. A higher relative abundance of D. leontia was observed in the
   southern localities (tropical) while D. kikkawai was more abundant in
   the northern localities (sub-tropical). Both the species showed a
   negative cline for heat tolerance along the latitude i.e. following a
   trend of increased tolerance level in the southern populations compared
   to northern ones. Contrarily, a positive cline for cold tolerance was
   evident in D. kikkawai, while such intra-specific population differences
   were non-significant in D. leontia. Further, we found the evidence for
   heat and cold hardening effects only in D. kikkawai. In D. kikkawai,
   higher hardening capacity for heat as well as cold tolerance was
   observed in northern populations compared to southern populations,
   despite lower basal heat tolerance in northern populations. In
   conclusion, clinal patterns for hardening capacity for heat and cold
   tolerance in D. kikkawai while absence of the same in D. leontia suggest
   divergent evolutionary history of these two sympatric sibling species.

AB Future climate change is leading to the redistribution of life on Earth
   as species struggle to cope with rising temperatures. Local adaptation
   allows species to become locally optimized and persist despite
   environmental selection, but the extent to which this occurs in nature
   may be limited by dispersal and gene flow. Congeneric marine gastropod
   species (Littorina littorea and L. saxatilis) with markedly different
   developmental modes were collected from across a latitudinal thermal
   gradient to explore the prevalence of local adaptation to temperature.
   The acute response of metabolic rate (using oxygen consumption as a
   proxy) to up-ramping and down-ramping temperature regimes between 6
   degrees C and 36 degrees C was quantified for five populations of each
   species. The highly dispersive L. littorea exhibited minimal evidence of
   local adaptation to the thermal gradient, with no change in thermal
   optimum (T-opt) or thermal breadth (T-br) and a decline in maximal
   performance ((max)) with increasing latitude. In contrast, the direct
   developing L. saxatilis displayed evidence of local optimization,
   although these varied idiosyncratically with latitude, suggesting a
   suite of selective pressures may be involved in shaping thermal
   physiology in this relatively sedentary species. Our results show that
   the biogeography of thermal traits can differ significantly between
   related species, and show that interpopulation differences in thermal
   performance do not necessarily follow simple patterns that may be
   predicted based on latitudinal changes in environmental temperatures.
   Further research is clearly required to understand the mechanisms that
   can lead to the emergence of local adaptation in marine systems better
   and allow improved predictions of species redistribution in response to
   climate change.

AB We investigated the highest constant temperature at which
   actinopterygian fishes can complete their lifecycles, based on an oxygen
   supply model for cleavage-stage eggs. This stage is one of the most
   heat-sensitive periods during the lifecycle, likely reflecting the
   exhaustion of maternally supplied heat shock proteins without new
   production. The model suggests that average eggs would not develop
   normally under a constant temperature of about 36 degrees C or higher.
   This estimate matches published empirical values derived from laboratory
   and field observations. Spermatogenesis is more heat sensitive than
   embryogenesis in fishes, so the threshold may indeed be lower, at about
   35 degrees C, unless actinopterygian fishes evolve heat tolerance during
   spermatogenesis as in birds. Our model also predicts an inverse
   relationship between egg size and temperature, and empirical data
   support this prediction. Therefore, the average egg size, and hence
   hatching size, is expected to shrink in a greenhouse world but a feeding
   function prohibits the survival of very small hatchlings, posing a limit
   to the shrinkage. It was once suggested that a marine animal community
   may be sustained under temperatures up to about 38 degrees C, and this
   value is being used, for example, in paleotemperature reconstruction. A
   revision of the value is overdue. (199/200)

AB Bolting (pre-mature flowering) produced before completion of normal life
   cycle which directly affects the bulb yield in onion. The experiments
   were conducted in two consecutive seasons during 2013-14 and 2014-15 in
   a randomized complete block design (RCBD) replicated three times at
   Agricultural Research Institute, Mingora Swat. Nursery of onion cultivar
   Swat-1 was raised and healthy seedlings were transplanted on five
   different dates (15th Nov, 1st Dec, 15th Dec, 1st Jan, 15th Jan). Four
   levels of nitrogen fertilizer (75, 100, 125, 150 kg ha(-1)) were applied
   with the objective to determine its influence on inflorescence
   development in onion bulb crop. Bolting percentage gradually decreased
   with increase in nitrogen fertilizer. Maximum bolting percentage was
   recorded in early transplanting and gradually declined with delay in
   transplanting. Bolting incidence did not occurred in very late
   transplanting (15th Jan) irrespective of the rate of nitrogen applied.
   Plant height, stem thickness, bulb diameter, bulb weight and total yield
   increased with increase in nitrogen fertilizer and conversely showed a
   downward trend with delay in transplanting. Nitrogen doses didn't
   significantly influenced leaves per plant. Early transplanting took
   maximum days to maturity than late transplanting. Maturity was delayed
   with increase in nitrogen fertilizer. Percent cull decreased with
   increase in the rate of nitrogen fertilizer. Marketable yield was
   maximum at mid transplanting (15th Dec) with maximum dose of nitrogen
   fertilizer. It can be concluded that 150 kg N ha(-1) should be applied
   and transplanting should be delayed up to December 15th to avoid bolting
   and have maximum marketable yield.

   Malpura rams (average body weight 55.0 kg) were divided into two groups,
   GI (n = 9; Control) and GII (n = 9; heat stress). The study was
   conducted for a period of 60 days. The results showed that body weight,
   body condition score, heart girth and feed intake were significantly (p
   < 0.05) lower in GII as compared to GI rams. The physiological responses
   i.e. respiration rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature and sweating rate
   (body and scrotum) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in rams exposed
   to heat stress. Among the endocrine parameters, plasma T-3, T-4 and
   testosterone concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in GII
   rams, while cortisol concentration was significantly (p < 0.05) higher
   in GII rams. In addition, heat stress significantly (p < 0.05) reduced
   semen volume, total sperm motility, sperm concentration and progressive
   sperm motility in GII rams. The results indicated that Malpura rams
   adapted to the heat stress condition, however, while doing so their
   production performances were compromised.

AB Pythium myriotylum and P. zingiberis have both been implicated in soft
   rot of ginger (Zingiber spp.). The status of these two taxa as distinct
   species follows original descriptions of physiology, morphology and
   pathogenicity. However, their status has been questioned by phylogenetic
   analyses. In this study, putative P. zingiberis isolates recovered from
   edible ginger (Z. officinale) rhizomes with Pythium soft rot (PSR)
   disease sampled from Queensland, Australia, were compared with reference
   isolates of P. myriotylum from peanut in Israel (CBS254.70) and P.
   zingiberis from ginger in Japan (NBRC30817). All isolates differed
   slightly in temperature optima for growth and produced similar sizes of
   oogonia and oospores. The sequence homology of 20 gene fragments
   retrieved from nuclear and mitochondrial genomes ranges from over 99 to
   100% to each other. In vitro pathogenicity assays were conducted on
   excised carrot, ginger, potato, radish and sweet potato tuber/root
   sections and on seeds and seedlings of cucumber, cauliflower, millet,
   rye, sweet corn, tomato and wheat with each of the isolates. The
   reference isolate P. zingiberis NBRC30817, which was previously believed
   to have a narrow host range, was pathogenic on a number of tested plant
   species. Analysis of this comprehensive set of data allowed us to assign
   all tested isolates, including the isolate P. zingiberis NBRC30817, to
   the taxon P. myriotylum, thus confirming that the causal pathogen of PSR
   disease of ginger in Australia is P. myriotylum.

AB Limpets of the genus Lottia occupy a broad vertical distribution on
   wave-exposed rocky shores, a range that encompasses gradients in the
   frequency and severity of thermal and desiccation stress brought on by
   aerial emersion. Using western blot analysis of levels of heat-shock
   protein 70 (Hsp70), we examined the heat-shock responses of four Lottia
   congeners: Lottia scabra and L. austrodigitalis, which occur in the
   high-intertidal zone, and L. pelta and L. scutum, which are restricted
   to the low- and mid-intertidal zones. Our results suggest distinct
   strategies of Hsp70 expression in limpets occupying different heights
   and orientations in the rocky intertidal zone. In freshly
   field-collected animals and in specimens acclimated at ambient
   temperature (approximate to 14 degrees C) for 14 days, the two
   high-intertidal species had higher constitutive levels of Hsp70 than the
   low- and mid-intertidal species. During aerial exposure to high
   temperatures, the two low-shore species and L. austrodigitalis exhibited
   an onset of Hsp70 expression at 28 degrees C; no induction of Hsp70
   occurred in L. scabra. Our findings suggest that high-intertidal
   congeners of Lottia employ a "preparative defense" strategy involving
   maintenance of high constitutive levels of Hsp70 in their cells as a
   mechanism for protection against periods of extreme and unpredictable
   heat stress.

AB We use a factorial experimental design to test whether rearing at colder
   temperatures shifts the lower thermal envelope for flight of Drosophila
   melanogaster Meigen to colder temperatures. D. melanogaster that
   developed in colder temperatures (15 degrees C) had a significant flight
   advantage in cold air compared to flies that developed in warmer
   temperatures (28 degrees C). At 14 degrees C, cold-reared flies failed
   to perform a take-off flight similar to 47% of the time whereas
   warm-reared flies failed similar to 94% of the time. At 18 degrees C,
   cold- and warm-reared flies performed equally well. We also compared
   several traits in cold- and warm-developing flies to determine if
   cold-developing flies had better flight performance at cold temperatures
   due to changes in body mass, wing length, wing loading, relative flight
   muscle mass or wing-beat frequency. The improved ability to fly at low
   temperatures was associated with a dramatic increase in wing area and an
   increase in wing length (after controlling for wing area). Flies that
   developed at 15 degrees C had similar to 25% more wing area than
   similarly sized flies that developed at 28 degrees C. Cold-reared flies
   had slower wing-beat frequencies than similarly sized flies from warmer
   developmental environments, whereas other traits did not vary with
   developmental temperature. These results demonstrate that developmental
   plasticity in wing dimensions contributes to the improved flight
   performance of D. melanogaster at cold temperatures, and ultimately, may
   help D. melanogaster live in a wide range of thermal environments.

AB Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) is the main forest tree species in
   Burabai National Park. Trees here grow under continental climate
   conditions. There are no dendroclimatological studies based on Scots
   pine of this region. The purpose of this study was to find the
   relationships between tree-ring widths and climate. For this purpose, a
   total of 176 cores from 100 Scots pine trees were collected. After
   measuring tree-ring widths, standard chronology building methods were
   used, and three site chronologies were constructed. Correlation
   coefficients between tree-ring widths with temperature and precipitation
   were calculated. Precipitation from October of the previous year to July
   of current year had a positive influence on tree-ring widths and
   August-September precipitation have the opposite effect. Temperature in
   the winter had positive effect for tree-ring growth but significantly
   negative during summer. Effects of climate changes on tree-ring widths
   were observed. The variation and sensitivity of tree-ring widths
   increased after 1940s. An increasing trend in precipitation,
   temperature, and tree-ring widths were clearly observed. In conclusion,
   tree-rings of Scots pine in Burabai are highly sensitive to growing site
   conditions and are affected by climate changes.

AB Raising the temperature of rabbit skeletal muscle from similar to 0
   degrees C to similar to 20 degrees C has been shown to enhance the
   helical organization of the myosin heads and to change the intensities
   of the 10 and 11 equatorial reflections. We show here by time-resolved
   x-ray diffraction combined with temperature jump that the movement of
   the heads to enhance the organized myosin helix occurs at the same fast
   rate as the change in the intensities of the equatorial reflections.
   However, model calculations indicate that the change in the equatorials
   cannot be explained simply in terms of the movement of myosin heads.
   Analysis of electron micrographs of transverse sections of relaxed
   muscle fibers cryofixed at similar to 5 degrees C and similar to 35
   degrees C shows that in addition to the reorganization of the heads the
   thin and thick filaments are less constrained to their positions in the
   hexagonal filament lattice in the warm muscle than in the cold.
   Incorporating the changes in filament order in model calculations
   reconciles these with the observed changes in equatorial reflections. We
   suggest the thin filaments in the cold muscle are boxed into their
   positions by the thermal movement of the disordered myosin heads. In the
   warmer muscle, the packed-down heads leave the thin filaments more room
   to diffuse laterally.

AB Comparative biochemistry and physiology offer the advantage of
   specifically defining the functional parameters or traits that affect an
   organism's performance (e.g., amino acids that affect K-m, enzymes that
   affect metabolism). By combining these functional determinations with
   both intraspecific and phylogenetically appropriate analyses,
   comparative biologists can indicate that a trait is biologically
   important by demonstrating that it is evolving by natural selection, An
   evolutionary approach may benefit from the analysis of variation within
   and among closely related species. The advantages of analyzing closely
   related species are that they allow one to identify more definitively
   the derived conditions and suggest why differences arose. Importantly,
   there is substantial variation in physiological and biochemical traits
   within and among closely related species. For example, among species
   within a single genus of teleost, Fundulus, the variation in enzyme
   expression is similar to the variation seen among most superorders of
   teleost, However, most of the variation within the genus Fundulus is
   most readily explained by evolutionary distance, and thus there is no
   compelling reason for further adaptive hypotheses. Extending this
   observation, the greater the phylogenetic distance between taxa in a
   comparative study, the more likely there will be a statistically
   significant difference that may only represent evolutionary time. The
   molecular mechanisms affecting adaptive variation in enzyme expression
   appear to be readily altered and may vary within a species or between
   acclimation conditions. Thus, studies among closely related organisms
   are more likely to identify the specific molecular or biochemical
   changes responsible for adaptive variation.

AB Theory posits that selection on functionally interrelated characters
   will promote physical and genetic integration resulting in evolution of
   favourable trait-value combinations. The pygmy grasshopper Tetrix
   undulata (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) displays a genetically encoded
   polymorphism for colour pattern. Colour morphs differ in several traits,
   including behaviours, thermal biology and body size. To examine if these
   size differences may reflect phenotypic plasticity of growth and
   development in response to temperature we used a split brood-design and
   reared hatchlings from mothers belonging to different morphs in
   different thermal environments (warm or cold) until maturity. We found
   that time to maturity was longer in the cold compared with the warm
   treatment. In the warm (but not in the cold) treatment time to maturity
   also varied among individuals born to mothers belonging to different
   colour morphs. Although low temperature and long development time are
   normally accompanied by increased body size in ectotherms, our results
   revealed no difference in size at maturity between individuals reared in
   the two temperature treatments. There was also an increase (not a
   decrease) in adult body size with shortened time to maturity across
   families within each treatment. Taken together, this suggests that body
   size is canalized against environmental perturbations, and that early
   maturation does not necessarily trade off against a size-mediated
   decrease in fecundity. Heritability of body size was moderate in
   magnitude. Moreover, body size at maturity varied among individuals
   belonging to different morphs and was influenced also by maternal colour
   morph, suggesting that a genetic correlation exists between colour
   pattern and body size. These findings suggest that different characters
   have evolved in concert and that the various colour morphs represent
   different evolutionary strategies, i.e., alternative peaks in a
   multi-modal adaptive landscape.

   degrees C for fish acclimated to 8.4 degrees C and 16.0 degrees C, and
   was 25.0 degrees C for those acclimated to 20.0 degrees C, temperatures
   that were similar to the median tolerance limits of Arctic grayling in
   Alaska. Comparisons of mean CTM and UILT for juvenile Arctic grayling
   with levels and durations of maximum river temperatures recorded during

AB We report the first measures of thermotolerance (recorded as percentage
   mortality and induced HSP70 production) for pelagic larvae of three
   populations of the New Zealand greenshell (green-lipped) mussel Perna
   canaliculus. Our goal was to determine whether distinct populations of
   P. canaliculus were more susceptible to predicted climate change than
   others, and whether such patterns of susceptibility were either
   genetically controlled (local adaptation of populations) or simply
   reflect the acclimatory capacity of this species. F2 larvae from three
   P. canaliculus populations (D'Urville Island, Banks Peninsula and
   Stewart Island) were subjected to an acute thermal challenge (3h
   exposure to a fixed temperature in the range 20-42 degrees C). No
   latitudinal patterns in either percentage mortality or HSP70 protein
   production were apparent. For all populations, larval mortality (LT50)
   was between 32.9 and 33.9 degrees C, with significant amounts of HSP70
   induction only occurring in those individuals that experienced
   temperatures of 40 degrees C or greater. The data presented therefore do
   not support the hypothesis that genetic adaptation of P. canaliculus to
   distinct thermal environments will be reflected by a corresponding
   difference in acute heat tolerance. In fact, the apparently vulnerable
   veligers show a surprisingly wide thermal safety margin. To develop a
   comprehensive understanding of the effects of ocean warming upon this
   species, subsequent studies should consider the impacts of sub-lethal
   stress upon fitness in addition to chronic thermal challenge and,
   crucially, the response of sedentary juvenile and adult stages.

AB Understanding the physiological abilities of organisms to cope with heat
   stress is critical for predictions of species' distributions in response
   to climate change. We investigated physiological responses (respiration
   and heart beat rate) of the ectotherm limpet Patella vulgata to heat
   stress events during emersion and the role of seasonal and microclimatic
   acclimatization for individual thermal tolerance limits. Individuals
   were collected from 5 microhabitats characterized by different exposure
   to solar radiation in the high intertidal zone of a semi-exposed rocky
   shore in winter and summer of 2014. Upper thermal tolerance limits(heat
   coma temperatures - HCTs, and heart rate Arrhenius break temperatures
   ABTs) were determined for individuals from each microhabitat in both
   seasons under laboratory conditions. While we found a clear seasonal
   acclimatization, i.e., higher Has and ABTs in summer than in winter, we
   did not find evidence for microhabitat-specific responses that would
   suggest microclimatic acclimatization. However, operative limpet
   temperatures derived from in-situ temperature measurements suggest that
   individuals from sun exposed microhabitats have a much narrower thermal
   safety margins than those from less exposed surfaces or within crevices.
   Microhabitat specific thermal safety margins caused by high thermal
   heterogeneity at small spatial scales and the lack of short term
   acclimatization will likely shape small scale distribution patterns of
   intertidal species in response to the predicted increase in the
   frequency and intensity of heat waves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Genetically based body size differences are naturally
   occurring in populations of Drosophila melanogaster, with bigger flies
   in the cold. Despite the cosmopolitan nature of body size clines in more
   than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling
   the genetic basis of body size variation are not fully understood. In
   particular, it is not clear what the selective value of cell size and
   cell area variation exactly is. In the present work we determined
   variation in viability, developmental time and larval competitive
   ability in response to crowding at two temperatures after artificial
   selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in four
   different natural populations of D. melanogaster.
   Results: No correlated effect of selection on viability or developmental
   time was observed among all selected populations. An increase in
   competitive ability in one thermal environment (18 C) under high larval
   crowding was observed as a correlated response to artificial selection
   for cell size.
   Conclusion: Viability and developmental time are not affected by
   selection for the cellular component of body size, suggesting that these
   traits only depend on the contingent genetic makeup of a population. The
   higher larval competitive ability shown by populations selected for
   reduced cell area seems to confirm the hypothesis that cell area
   mediated changes have a relationship with fitness, and might be the
   preferential way to change body size under specific circumstances.

AB We studied the effects of metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) in two
   populations of a eurythermal species, spotted seatrout (Cynoscion
   nebulosus) along the U.S. East Coast. Fish were captured from their
   natural environment and acclimated at control temperatures 15 degrees C
   or 20 degrees C. Their oxygen consumption rates, a proxy for metabolic
   rates, were measured using intermittent flow respirometry during acute
   temperature decrease or increase (2.5 degrees C per hour). Mass-specific
   standard metabolic rates (SMR) were higher in fish from the northern
   population across an ecologically relevant temperature gradient (5
   degrees C to 30 degrees C). SMR were up to 37% higher in the northern
   population at 25 degrees C and maximum metabolic rates (MMR) were up to
   20% higher at 20 degrees C. We found evidence of active metabolic
   compensation in the southern population from 5 degrees C to 15 degrees C
   (Q(10) < 2), but not in the northern population. Taken together, our
   results indicate differences in metabolic plasticity between the
   northern and southern populations of spotted seatrout and provide a
   mechanistic basis for predicting population-specific responses to
   climate change.

AB Satellite-derived frontal metrics describe characteristics of oceanic
   thermal fronts, such as their strength or persistence. They are used in
   marine science to investigate spatio-temporal variability of thermal
   fronts or in ecological studies to assist in explaining animal
   distributions. Although these metrics represent highly processed data,
   which is based on sometimes complex algorithms, little guidance is
   available on their correct application in quantitative analyses, in
   particular for non-specialist users. This research aims to improve
   accurate use of frontal data. This case study investigates the
   inter-annual and seasonal variability of two tidal mixing fronts on the
   Celtic Sea shelf, based on monthly time series of daily frontal maps at
   similar to 1km2 resolution from 1990 to 2010. Some metrics are almost
   identical and can be grouped, e.g. frontal probability, persistence and
   so-called "composites" (Pearson correlation: r = 0.8-1.0; p < 0.001),
   whereas the metric describing frontal strength is distinct from other
   ones. Consequently, strength and metrics of the frontal probability
   group showed pronounced differences in their inter-annual and seasonal
   variability: Strength displayed an oscillating pattern between 1990 and
   2010 while there were no significant changes in probability over time.
   In addition, seasonal variability was affected by segments from adjacent
   fronts, not belonging to the fronts of interest, which could result in
   biased estimates. Most important, there was a doubling of available
   satellite imagery between 1990 and 2010 due to a greater number of
   operational satellites, which negatively affected frontal probability,
   positively frontal strength and consequently, changed the temporal
   pattern of both. When using frontal maps for temporal analyses, we
   should choose the metric carefully, be aware of biased estimates caused
   by variability from unwanted frontal segments in the data and account
   for the variable data quantity. This guide on the use of frontal metrics
   will be helpful to improve correct interpretations of statistical
   analyses.

AB The natural environment of Estonia is sensitive to climate change due to
   its location in a transitional zone between areas with different
   bioclimatic conditions. We studied the NAO index and data on
   temperature, moisture, wind, and sea level regimes in Estonia and the
   Baltic Sea region. We also looked at the relationships between
   meteorological forcing time series and changes in wetlands. The effects
   of changing climatic conditions are clearly reflected in the data from
   the station at Tooma mire, where we identified shorter snow-cover
   duration, decreased soil-frost depth and changed groundwater levels in
   the bog. In comparing various types of Estonian wetlands under such
   changing climatic conditions, we also identified greater instability in
   the character of coastal wetlands compared to that of the inland bogs.
   We found that the most marked coastal changes in Estonia result from a
   combination of strong storms, high sea levels induced by storm surge,
   ice free seas and unfrozen sediments. Finally, we also found that a
   significant trend in the development of seashore grasslands is the
   replacement of former meadows by reed beds, shrubberies or woodland.

   generally below normal from February 2003 until June 2004 ( with the
   exception of two months). Sunshine duration was above normal,
   particularly in regions which usually have rainy and cloudy episodes in
   summer, and relative air humidity was below normal during the whole year
   of 2003. The drought experienced by the vegetation in summer 2003 was
   exacerbated by the length of the period with scarce precipitation and
   humidity, by the heat during the summer and by long sunshine duration.

AB Global environmental change (GEC) is a significant concern. However,
   forecasting the outcomes of this change for species and ecosystems
   remains a major challenge. In particular, predicting specific changes in
   systems where initial conditions, instabilities, and model errors have
   large impacts on the outcome is problematic. Indeed, predictive
   community ecology has been deemed unworthy of pursuit or an unreachable
   goal. However, new developments in large-scale biology provide ways of
   thinking that might substantially improve forecasts of local and
   regional impacts of climate change. Most notably, these are the explicit
   recognition of the regional and landscape contexts within which
   populations reside, the matrix approach that can be used to investigate
   the consequences of population variation across space and within
   assemblages, and the development of macrophysiology, which explicitly
   seeks to understand the ecological implications of physiological
   variation across large spatial and temporal scales. Here we explore how
   a combination of these approaches might promote further understanding
   and forecasting of the effects of global climate change and perhaps
   other GEC drivers on biodiversity. We focus on the population level,
   examining the ways in which environmental variation might be translated
   through performance and its plasticity to variation in demography.

AB Because of its profound effects on the rates of biological processes
   such as aerobic metabolism, environmental temperature plays an important
   role in shaping the distribution and abundance of species. As
   temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly
   declines at higher temperatures - a response that can be described using
   a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although the shape of the TPC for
   aerobic metabolism is often attributed to the competing effects of
   thermodynamics, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and
   the effects of temperature on protein stability, this account represents
   an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level of single
   proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account for the effects of
   temperature on complex multistep processes, such as aerobic metabolism,
   that rely on mechanisms acting across multiple levels of biological
   organization. The purpose of this review is to explore our current
   understanding of the factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism
   in response to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas
   where this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more
   strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape of the TPC
   for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these TPCs are the foundation
   of several recent attempts to predict the responses of species to
   climate change, including the metabolic theory of ecology and the
   hypothesis of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance.

AB Sediments from South Lake, Brock Plateau (Melville Hills), Northwest

   Sedimentation commenced at least 13 900 cal. yr BP, and possibly as
   early as 16 000 cal. yr BP, in response to early deglaciation of the
   site. Pollen is present throughout the record, with an initial
   Artemisia-Salix assemblage indicative of very cold conditions,
   consistent with a locally severe Younger Dryas Stade or simply continued
   proximity of the Laurentide Ice Sheet margin (c. 12 700 to 11 500 cal.
   yr BP). At c. 11 000 cal. yr BP, abiotic proxies signal a transition to
   warmer conditions, corroborated by a pollen assemblage dominated by
   Betula and Cyperaceae. Although South Lake was biologically productive
   during the early Holocene (c. 11 000 to 7000 cal. yr BP), diatoms and
   other siliceous organisms are notably absent from the record, suggesting
   severe silica limitation. Rises in Alnus crispa and Picea mariana pollen
   at c. 7000 cal. yr BP suggest cooling and/or an increase in effective
   moisture. Wetter conditions and increased hydrological inputs and silica
   supply likely led to the establishment of a pioneering diatom community
   at c. 6500 cal. yr BP. Decreased organic sedimentation after c. 2000
   cal. yr BP suggests cooler conditions. Additionally, changing
   niveo-eolian deposition of sand on lake ice varied with a c. 3000-year
   periodicity through the entire record. The South Lake multiproxy record
   supports the hypothesis that the Brock Plateau was one of the earliest
   deglaciated regions during the late Wisconsinan.

AB There is some evidence that rice cultivars respond differently to
   elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]), but [CO2] x cultivar interaction
   has never been tested under open-field conditions across different
   sites. Here, we report on trials conducted at free-air CO2 enrichment
   (FACE) facilities at two sites in Japan, Shizukuishi (2007 and 2008) and
   Tsukuba (2010). The average growing-season air temperature was more than
   5 degrees C warmer at Tsukuba than at Shizukuishi. For four cultivars
   tested at both sites, the [CO2] x cultivar interaction was significant
   for brown rice yield, but there was no significant interaction with
   site-year. Higher-yielding cultivars with a large sink size showed a
   greater [CO2] response. The Tsukuba FACE experiment, which included
   eight cultivars, revealed a wider range of yield enhancement (3-36%)
   than the multi-site experiment. All of the tested yield components
   contributed to this enhancement, but there was a highly significant
   [CO2] x cultivar interaction for percentage of ripened spikelets. These
   results suggest that a large sink is a prerequisite for higher
   productivity under elevated [CO2], but that improving carbon allocation
   by increasing grain setting may also be a practical way of increasing
   the yield response to elevated [CO2].

AB There is justified concern about the impact of global warming on the
   persistence of tropical ectotherms. There is also growing evidence for
   strong selection on climate-relevant physiological traits. Understanding
   the evolutionary potential of populations is especially important for
   low dispersal organisms in isolated populations, because these
   populations have little choice but to adapt. Despite this, direct
   estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for physiological
   traits in ectotherms-which will determine their evolutionary responses
   to selection-are sparse, especially for reptiles. Here we examine the
   heritabilities and genetic correlations for a set of four morphological
   and six climate-relevant physiological traits in an isolated population
   of an Australian rainforest lizard, Lampropholis coggeri. These traits
   show considerable variation across populations in this species,
   suggesting local adaptation. From laboratory crosses, we estimated very
   low to moderate heritability of temperature-related physiological traits
   (h(2)<0.31), but significant and higher heritability of desiccation
   resistance (h(2)similar to 0.42). These values contrasted with uniformly
   higher heritabilities (h(2)>0.51) for morphological traits. At the
   phenotypic level, there were positive associations among the
   morphological traits and between thermal limits. Growth rate was
   positively correlated with thermal limits, but there was no indication
   that morphology and physiology were linked in any other way. We found
   some support for a specialist-generalist trade-off in the thermal
   performance curve, but otherwise there was no evidence for evolutionary
   constraints, suggesting broadly labile multivariate trait structure. Our
   results indicate little potential to respond to selection on thermal
   traits in this population and provide new insights into the capacity of
   tropical ectotherms to adapt in situ to rapid climate change.

AB Synopsis Understanding thermal ranges and limits of organisms becomes
   important in light of climate change and observed effects on ecosystems
   as reported by the IPCC (2014). Evolutionary adaptation to temperature
   is presently unable to keep animals and other organisms in place; if
   they can these rather follow the moving isotherms. These effects of
   climate change on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have brought into
   focus the mechanisms by which temperature and its oscillations shape the
   biogeography and survival of species. For animals, the integrative
   concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has
   successfully characterized the sublethal limits to performance and the
   consequences of such limits for ecosystems. Recent models illustrate how
   routine energy demand defines the realized niche. Steady state
   temperature-dependent performance profiles thus trace the thermal window
   and indicate a key role for aerobic metabolism, and the resulting budget
   of available energy (power), in defining performance under routine
   conditions, from growth to exercise and reproduction. Differences in the
   performance and productivity of marine species across latitudes relate
   to changes in mitochondrial density, capacity, and other features of
   cellular design. Comparative studies indicate how and why such
   mechanisms underpinning OCLTT may have developed on evolutionary
   timescales in different climatic zones and contributed to shaping the
   functional characteristics and species richness of the respective fauna.
   A cause-and-effect understanding emerges from considering the
   relationships between fluctuations in body temperature, cellular design,
   and performance. Such principles may also have been involved in shaping
   the functional characteristics of survivors in mass extinction events
   during earth's history; furthermore, they may provide access to
   understanding the evolution of endothermy in mammals and birds.
   Accordingly, an understanding is emerging how climate changes and
   variability throughout earth's history have influenced animal evolution
   and co-defined their success or failure from a bio-energetic point of
   view. Deepening such understanding may further reduce uncertainty about
   projected impacts of anthropogenic climate variability and change on the
   distribution, productivity and last not least, survival of aquatic and
   terrestrial species.

AB This work is part of a series of aerobiological researches conducted in
   the city of Mar del Plata, Argentina. The annual, seasonal and daily
   features of the pollen cloud were analyzed over 2 years, together with
   the effects of the meteorological variables. Cupressaceae amounted to 75
   and 54% of the annual total in each year, and it was analyzed separately
   due to its proven overrepresentation. Eighty-five pollen types were
   registered during the 2 years, bearing a similar annual pattern (more
   than 50% from August to November, December also being an important
   month). Arboreal pollen predominated between late winter and spring (61
   and 49% of the annual total), while non-arboreal pollen did so from late
   spring to summer. The observed seasonality was significantly correlated
   with the monthly mean temperatures and associated with its effect on
   phenology. No significant differences along the day were detected
   between years and 50% of the daily total was recorded between 1000 and
   1600 hours. The maximum concentration was registered at 1000 hours in
   spring and summer, but later in autumn and winter. Regarding the hourly
   scale, the significant correlation of total pollen with temperature and
   wind speed was positive, albeit negative with relative humidity. These
   effects are linked to airborne pollen release and transport. The role
   rainfall plays on airborne pollen is discussed. To interpret the
   results, it is important to consider the time scale at which the
   aerobiological phenomenon is analyzed.

AB In this study, we examined the effects of repeated cold exposure (RCE)
   on the survival, energy content and stress protein expression of larvae
   of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera: Chironomidae).
   Additionally, we compared results between larvae that were frozen at -5
   degrees C in the presence of water during RCE and those that were
   supercooled at -5 degrees C in a dry environment. Although >95% of
   larvae survived a single 12. h bout of freezing at -5 C, after five
   cycles of RCE survival of frozen larvae dropped below 70%. Meanwhile,
   the survival of control and supercooled larvae was unchanged, remaining
   around 90% for the duration of the study. At the tissue level, frozen
   larvae had higher rates of cell mortality in the midgut than control and
   supercooled larvae. Furthermore, larvae that were frozen during RCE
   experienced a dramatic reduction in energy reserves; after five cycles,
   frozen larvae had 25% less lipid, 30% less glycogen and nearly 40% less
   trehalose than supercooled larvae. Finally, larvae that were frozen
   during RCE had higher expression of hsp70 than those that were
   supercooled, indicating a higher degree of protein damage in the frozen
   group. Results were similar between larvae that had accumulated 60h of
   freezing at -5 degrees C over five cycles of RCE and those that were
   frozen continuously for 60h, suggesting that the total time spent frozen
   determines the physiological response. Our results suggest that it is
   preferable, both from a survival and energetic standpoint, for larvae to
   seek dry microhabitats where they can avoid inoculative freezing and
   remain unfrozen during RCE.

AB Means and variances of the environmental thermal regime play an
   important role in determining the fitness of terrestrial ectotherms.
   Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have
   been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the
   classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth understanding of
   plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We
   investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating
   thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different
   amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life
   stages of Drosophila melanogaster. For developmental acclimation, we
   found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for
   critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a
   beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult
   acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes,
   cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature
   conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat
   tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating
   temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly,
   we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was
   gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more
   prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with
   adult acclimation in D. melanogaster.

AB A close relation between sleep and body temperature has been noted
   already for a long time. Although a correlation is indisputable, there
   is at present hardly evidence for a causal involvement of sleep in
   changes in body temperature. Concerning the reverse, a causal
   involvement of body temperature in sleep has been demonstrated: if core
   or skin temperature changes activate thermoregulatory processes aimed at
   heat loss or heat preservation, sleep is usually disrupted. We have
   recently proposed that sleep propensity is also affected by more subtle
   changes in skin temperature, within the thermoneutral range (Van Someren
   (2000). Chronobiol. Int. 17, 313-354). These changes are likely to
   modulate the firing properties of thermosensitive neurons in brain areas
   involved in sleep regulation. Subtle changes in skin temperature occur
   daily under control of the circadian timing system. They could provide
   this system with an additional signal pathway to support its neuronal
   and neurohormonal signals to enforce circadian modulation of sleep
   propensity. Subtle changes in skin temperature also result from
   behavior, and could contribute to the changes in sleep propensity
   resulting from these behaviors. The present review summarizes the
   neurobiological background and correlational physiological and
   behavioral data in support of the involvement of skin temperature in the
   modulation of sleep propensity. It moreover points out the type of
   experimental investigations needed to support or refute the hypothesis.

AB Eastern red-spotted newts are ectotherms, aquatic as adults, and active
   year-round, breeding even during winter under ice. Earlier research,
   with field-captured newts, showed a correlation between seasonal changes
   in the activity of some muscle metabolic enzymes and in the behavior of
   the newts in a thermal gradient. This study was undertaken to further
   characterize acclimatory responses in the newts in a more controlled
   laboratory environment. Newts were obtained during fall, and maintained
   at 15 degrees C with 12:12 LD for 4 weeks for SMR (at 8 and 26 degrees
   C) and temperature preference experiments. Subsequently, half the newts
   were exposed to summer conditions (26 degrees C, 14:10 LD) and half to
   winter conditions (8 degrees C, 10:14 LD). After 12 weeks, SMR and
   temperature preference experiments were repeated, and enzyme assays for
   cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), citrate synthase (CS), and lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH) were performed on muscle tissue homogenates, also at
   8 and 26 degrees C. Newts changed all three parameters in the
   laboratory. SMRs were highest in winter-acclimated newts and lowest in
   summer-acclimated newts, whereas temperature preference was lowest in
   winter-acclimated newts and highest in summer-acclimated newts. Finally,
   CCO activity was completely compensated in winter-acclimated newts, CS
   activity was partially compensated, and LDH activity was not seasonally
   sensitive. These results indicate a connection or relationship between
   changes in seasonal environmental conditions, and some aspects of the
   muscle biochemistry, SMR, and thermoregulatory behavior of these
   ectotherms. J. Exp. Zool. 373A:231-239, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The notion of ecological optimum is discussed as related to aquatic
   poikilothermic animals. Publications on the analysis of the influence of
   thermal factor on vital functions of invertebrates with the subsequent
   statement of the general pattern of optimal environmental factors are
   reviewed. It is concluded that the optimum includes not simply the range
   of the factor's values on the tolerance curve or the dose of the factor
   providing for the most favourable life conditions, but the oscillations
   of the factor within the optimum range, i.e., the astatic optimum, as
   termed by Prof. A.S. Konstantinov. It is shown, by the example of the
   influence on organisms and populations of zooplankton of stepwise
   changes of temperature, increased doses of mineral phosphorus, and
   low-power laser radiation, that to determine the optimum of an
   environmental factor it is important to use not only its absolute values
   and the parameters of cyclic changes, but also the presence or absence
   of stepwise changes, also determining the direction of the dynamics and
   the duration of influence of the "dose", as well as the presence and
   character of the after-effects (inertial action) of the factor on
   organisms. It is suggested to introduce more detailed and concrete
   definitions to distinguish between the "static" and then "dynamic"
   optimum. The former includes the range of optimum values of the factor
   on the tolerance scale and the "dose" of every factor matching the
   organism's requirements and providing for the maximum favourable life
   conditions. The latter includes optimum parameters of cyclic changes
   (frequency and amplitude) of the factor, along with determining their
   position in the range of optimum values (at its lower, middle, or upper
   part), the presence or absence of stimulating effects of stepwise
   changes of the factor, including the duration of influence of some
   "dose" of the factor and the order of alteration of the higher and the
   lower values (dynamics direction), as well as the presence or absence
   and the character of after-effects (inertial action) of the factor on

   decline. In these studies, population cycles are thought to be driven

   the underlying driver of population cycles, but quantitative evidence
   has been lacking to date. In the present study, we employed high
   resolution temperature data, reports on mortality events, and population
   datasets to quantitatively examine the extent to which climate change
   was responsible for Chinese population cycles. Results show that there
   were 5 major population contractions in China between 1000 CE and 1911,
   and all of them occurred in periods with a cold climate, when mortality
   crises triggered population collapses. Nevertheless, the
   climate-population association is non-linear, because it is mediated by
   population pressure. Although social buffers were increasingly effective
   in dissipating climate forcing, they could not prevent population
   collapses from occurring during periods of long-term cooling. Our
   results challenge classic Malthusian and post-Malthusian interpretations
   of historical Chinese population cycles.

AB Understanding how natural environments shape phenotypic variation is a
   major aim in evolutionary biology. Here, we have examined clinal, likely
   genetically based variation in morphology among 19 populations of the
   fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from Africa and Europe, spanning a
   range from sea level to 3000 m altitude and including locations
   approximating the southern and northern range limit. We were interested
   in testing whether latitude and altitude have similar phenotypic
   effects, as has often been postulated. Both latitude and altitude were
   positively correlated with wing area, ovariole number, and cell number.
   In contrast, latitude and altitude had opposite effects on the ratio
   between ovariole number and body size, which was negatively correlated
   with egg production rate per ovariole. We also used transgenic
   manipulation to examine how increased cell number affects morphology and
   found that larger transgenic flies, due to a higher number of cells, had
   more ovarioles, larger wings, and, unlike flies from natural
   populations, increased wing loading. Clinal patterns in morphology are
   thus not a simple function of changes in body size; instead, each trait
   might be subject to different selection pressures. Together, our results
   provide compelling evidence for profound similarities as well as
   differences between phenotypic effects of latitude and altitude.

AB Tree rings are a natural archive containing valuable information about
   environmental changes. Among the most sensitive ecosystems to such
   changes are high-mountain forests. Tree-ring series from such locations
   are exceptionally valuable both for climate reconstructions and for
   studying the effects of climate changes on forest ecosystems.
   The objective of our study is to present new long tree-ring width
   chronologies of Pinus peuce Griseb. from several locations at Pirin
   Mountains in southwestern Bulgaria, to explore their correlation with
   monthly temperatures and precipitation in the research area and to
   assess their potential for climate reconstruction.
   We built three long-term index chronologies for the radial increment of
   P. peuce from treeline locations in the study region. The longest
   chronology spans 675 years. We studied the impact of monthly air
   temperature and precipitation on its growth for the past 86 years using
   multiple regression analysis. Our analysis shows that P. peuce growth is
   positively influenced by high temperatures at the end of the previous
   growing season, especially at the two sites in Banderitsa valley until
   the middle of the 1970s, and negatively affected by cold winters. In
   some of the sample plots its growth was also positively correlated with
   high summer temperatures. However, even at these high altitudes in some
   of the locations on steep slopes P. peuce showed signs of negative
   impact of drought during the hottest summer months (especially in
   August).
   Our chronologies contribute to the paleoclimatic record for southwestern
   Bulgaria, which could provide baseline information about past climate
   variability and improve our understanding of current and future
   environmental changes.

AB Using empirically derived relationships between temperature and
   development rate, deterministic and stochastic simulation models were
   constructed to predict the seasonal pattern of abundance of the sheep
   blowfly, Lucilia sericata. The number of day degrees accumulated each
   day by a cohort was calculated from the daily temperature pattern and
   the base temperature threshold for that stage. The diurnal temperature
   pattern was described by a simple sine curve relationship, based on the
   maximum and minimum temperatures. The stochastic model uses a
   Monte-Carlo simulation technique to assign random development rates to
   each life cycle stage generated from a Weibull distribution fitted to
   observed variation in development rate for each stage.
   The deterministic model typically predicts four discrete waves of
   emergence of L. sericata adults each season, with the fifth generation
   limited by the inset of dispause. The stochastic model resulted in a
   similar predicted population but with less discrete generations than the
   deterministic model and it more closely resembled the pattern of blowfly
   abundance observed in the field. Sensitivity analysis showed that both a
   reduction in the base temperatures and the number of day degrees
   required for life cycle development increased the daily rate of
   development at a given temperature and resulted in higher mean numbers
   of flies present each generation. However, the pattern of blowfly
   abundance observed was more sensitive to variations in base temperatures
   than day degree requirements. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB Vegetation phenology is strongly influenced by climatic factors. Climate
   changes may cause phenological variations, especially in the Alps which
   are considered to be extremely vulnerable to global warming. The main
   goal of our study is to analyze European larch (Larix decidua Mill.)
   phenology in alpine environments and the role of the ecological factors
   involved, using an integrated approach based on accurate field
   observations and modelling techniques. We present 2 years of
   field-collected larch phenological data, obtained following a
   specifically designed observation protocol. We observed that both spring
   and autumn larch phenology is strongly influenced by altitude. We
   propose an approach for the optimization of a spring warming model (SW)
   and the growing season index model (GSI) consisting of a model inversion
   technique, based on simulated look-up tables (LUTs), that provides
   robust parameter estimates. The optimized models showed excellent
   agreement between modelled and observed data: the SW model predicts the
   beginning of the growing season (B-GS) with a mean RMSE of 4 days, while
   GSI gives a prediction of the growing season length (L-GS) with a RMSE
   of 5 days. Moreover, we showed that the original GSI parameters led to
   consistent errors, while the optimized ones significantly increased
   model accuracy. Finally, we used GSI to investigate interactions of
   ecological factors during springtime development and autumn senescence.
   We found that temperature is the most effective factor during spring
   recovery while photoperiod plays an important role during autumn
   senescence: photoperiod shows a contrasting effect with altitude
   decreasing its influence with increasing altitude.

AB Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to express different
   phenotypes depending on the environment, provides an important mechanism
   by which an animal population can persist under rapid climate change. We
   experimentally tested both life-history and transcriptional responses of
   an ecological model species, the three-spined stickleback, to warm
   acclimation at the southern edge of its European range. We explored
   cross-environment genetic correlations of key life-history traits in
   male sticklebacks exposed to long-term temperature changes to examine
   whether the plasticity pattern was variable among genotypes by using a
   character-state approach. We also studied gene expression plasticity by
   analysing both whole-transcriptome and candidate gene expression in
   brain and liver. Male sticklebacks that developed under warmer
   conditions during winter were smaller in size and invested less in
   nuptial coloration at the beginning of the breeding season, showing
   similar responses across different genotypes. The lack of genetic
   variation in life-history responses may limit any future evolution of
   the thermal reaction norm in the study population. After long-term
   exposure to increased winter temperatures, genes responsible for several
   metabolic and oxidation-reduction processes were upregulated, and some
   hormone genes involved in growth and reproduction were downregulated in
   the brain. In the liver, there was no significantly represented gene
   ontology by the differentially expressed genes. Since a higher
   temperature leads to a higher resting metabolic rate, living in warmer
   environments may incur higher energetic costs for ectotherms to maintain
   cellular homoeostasis, resulting in negative consequences for
   life-history traits. The expression of genes related to metabolism,
   cellular homoeostasis and regulatory signalling may underlie
   temperature-induced changes in life history.

AB Ectotherms may respond to variable environmental conditions by altering
   their phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be
   beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several
   alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical
   support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by
   investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine
   populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and
   fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal
   performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging
   between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7
   degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For
   maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were
   found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated
   to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation
   treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance
   breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed
   little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral
   species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and
   fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also
   revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV
   (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to
   which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in
   the rate-temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically
   found support for the 'warmer is better' hypothesis for acclimation of
   locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.

AB The FH2 domains of formin family proteins act as processive cappers of
   actin filaments. Previously suggested stair-stepping mechanisms of
   processive capping imply that a formin cap rotates persistently in one
   direction with respect to the filament. This challenges the
   formin-mediated mechanism of intracellular cable formation. We suggest a
   novel scenario of processive capping that is driven by developing and
   relaxing torsion elastic stresses. Based on the recently discovered
   crystal structure of an FH2-actin complex, we propose a second mode of
   processive capping-the screw mode. Within the screw mode, the formin
   dimer rotates with respect to the actin filament in the direction
   opposite to that generated by the stair-stepping mode so that a
   combination of the two modes prevents persistent torsion strain
   accumulation. We determine an optimal regime of processive capping,
   whose essence is a periodic switch between the stair-stepping and screw
   modes. In this regime, elastic energy does not exceed feasible values,
   and supercoiling of actin filaments is prevented.

   guide molecular motors whose motions create flows. Near hyperbolic
   stagnation points, filaments experience a competition between bending
   elasticity and tension and are predicted to display suppressed thermal
   fluctuations in the extensional regime and a buckling instability under
   compression. Using a microfluidic cross-flow geometry, we verify these

AB Microtubules supported by surrounding cross linkers in eukaryotic cells
   can bear a much higher compressive force than free-standing
   microtubules. Different from some previous studies, which treated the
   surroundings as a continuum elastic foundation or elastic medium, the
   present paper develops amicromechanics numerical model to examine the
   role of randomly distributed discrete cross linkers in the buckling of
   compressed microtubules. First, the proposed numerical approach is
   validated by reproducing the uniform multiwave buckling mode predicted
   by the existing elastic-foundation model. For more realistic buckling of
   microtubules surrounded by randomly distributed cross linkers, the
   present numerical model predicts that the buckling mode is localized at
   one end in agreement with some known experimental observations. In
   particular, the critical force for localized buckling, predicted by the
   present model, is insensitive to microtubule length and can be about 1
   order of magnitude lower than those given by the elastic-foundation
   model, which suggests that the elastic-foundation model may have
   overestimated the critical force for buckling of microtubules in vivo.
   In addition, unlike the elastic-foundation model, the present model can
   capture the effect of end conditions on the critical force and
   wavelength of localized buckling. Based on the known data of spacing and
   elastic constants of cross linkers available in literature, the critical
   force and wavelength of the localized buckling mode, predicted by the
   present model, are compared to some experimental data with reasonable
   agreement. Finally, two empirical formulas are proposed for the critical
   force and wavelength of the localized buckling of microtubules
   surrounded by cross linkers.

AB Plant trichomes commonly serve a role in mechanical and chemical defence
   against herbivores, but may also have the potential to alter physiology
   by reducing the amount of light absorbed by leaves, lowering
   temperatures, and reducing water loss. Populations of Datura wrightii
   Regel in southern California produce 'sticky' plants with glandular
   trichomes and 'velvety' plants bearing non-glandular trichomes. Because
   stickiness is inherited as a dominant Mendelian trait, and the
   proportions of sticky plants vary among populations with the moisture
   availability of their environment, there may be some ecophysiological
   differences between trichome types that contribute to their ability to
   survive in a particular geographic location. To examine the possible
   physiological significance of trichome variation, we measured the
   spectral properties, midday gas-exchange rates, and water potentials of
   D. wrightii leaves from sticky and velvety plants growing in a field
   experiment. The differences in leaf reflectance (0.9%) and absorptance
   (1.3%) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) between trichome
   types are too small to have any direct physiologically significant
   effect. Simulations of leaf temperatures based on the difference in leaf
   absorptances reveal that leaf temperature would be no more than
   1degreesC lower in velvety compared to sticky plants. Gas-exchange
   measurements revealed no significant difference between types in their
   transpiration rates or stomatal conductances. In this case, trichome
   variation may be more important to plant defenses than to physiology.

AB Radial growth was examined in two Scots pine stands that were seeded

   activity on the timberline of northern Finnish Lapland. Tree-rings of
   seeded pines were calibrated against the instrumental records of local
   weather and large-scale atmospheric patterns and further compared to
   pines of natural origin on the timberline. The studied stands were shown
   to contain common growth variability that differed from the variability
   of natural pines. Deviating growth of seeded pines was attributed to
   their only moderate growth dependence on mid-summer (July) temperatures
   and, likewise, their strong dependence on the autumn climate in the
   previous year, and linked to the different genetic origin of artificial
   stands due to southern seeds. Stands were thinned for different
   densities in 1985 and 1986. The growth response to thinning was markedly
   better than could be expected according to previous studies. We found
   that the positive growth reaction conceivably benefited from the
   ameliorated winter conditions, expressed as warmed (March) temperatures
   and the prolonged positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (February).
   The results emphasize the determining influence of climatic fluctuations
   on reforestation and afforestation near the distributional limits of

   isofemale line design permitted to submit each line (full sibs) to the
   four thermal regimes. Under cold stress, the pigmentation was similar to
   the value observed at constant 25 degrees C, suggesting a kind of
   functional dominance of the high temperature phase. In all cases,
   thermal stresses increased the individual environmental variance, i.e.,
   increased the developmental instability. Genetic correlations between
   lines were not modified by the stresses but provided some unexpected and
   surprising results, which should be confirmed by further investigations:
   for example, negative correlations between pigmentation and body size or
   sternopleural bristle number. As a whole, the data do not confirm the
   hypothesis that under stressing conditions a hidden genetic variability

AB Geographic dines in ectotherm species including Drosophila melanogaster
   have been found throughout the world, with genetically larger body size
   and shorter development time occurring at high latitudes. Temperature is
   thought to pray a major role in the evolution of this clinal variation.
   Laboratory thermal selection has effects similar to those seen in
   geographical clines. Evolution at low temperatures results in more rapid
   development to larger adult flies. This study investigated the effects
   of geographical origin and experimental temperature on larval growth
   efficiency in D. melanogaster. Larvae from populations that had evolved
   at high latitudes were found to use limited food more efficiently, so
   that the overall adult body size achieved was larger. Larvae reared at a
   lower experimental temperature (18 degreesC) used food more efficiently
   than those reared at a higher temperature (25 degreesC). The increases
   in growth efficiency found in populations from high latitudes could
   explain their increased body size and more rapid development.

AB Activity thresholds were measured in nine anholocyclic clones of the
   peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae collected along a latitudinal cline of
   its European distribution from Sweden to Spain. The effects of
   collection origin and intra- and intergenerational acclimation on these
   thresholds were investigated. Low-temperature (10 degrees C) acclimation
   for one generation depressed the movement threshold and chill coma
   temperatures, with the largest reduction in movement threshold recorded
   for clone UK 1 (8.82.5 degrees C) and in chill coma for UK 2 (4.82.0
   degrees C). High-temperature (25 degrees C) acclimation for one
   generation increased the heat movement threshold and heat coma
   temperature with the largest increase in the movement threshold
   (40.141.1 degrees C) and heat coma (41.442.3 degrees C) recorded for
   clone Swed 1. There was no further intergenerational acclimation over
   three generations. High-temperature activity thresholds were less
   plastic than low-temperature thresholds, and, consequently, thermal
   activity ranges were expanded following low-temperature acclimation. No
   constant affect of acclimation was observed on chill coma recovery,
   although clonal differences were observed with Swed 1 and 3 requiring
   some of the longest complete recovery times. There was no relationship
   between latitude and activity thresholds with the exception of heat coma
   data where Scandinavian clones Swed 2 and 3 consistently displayed some
   of the lowest heat coma temperatures (e.g. 41.3 degrees C for both
   clones at 20 degrees C) and Mediterranean clones Span 1, 2 and 3
   displayed some of the highest (e.g. 42.1, 41.9 and 42.5 degrees C,
   respectively, at 20 degrees C). These data suggest that clonal mixing
   could occur over a large scale across Europe, limiting local adaptation
   to areas where conditions enable long-term persistence of populations,
   e.g. adaptation to higher temperatures in the Mediterranean region. It
   is suggested that aphid thermal tolerance could be governed more by
   clonal type than the latitudinal origin.

AB A high-resolution diatom record from core MD99-2275 reveals a series of
   palaeoceanographic changes on the North Icelandic shelf since about 9000
   cal. yr BP. The influence of relatively warm high-salinity Atlantic
   water-masses of the IC was strong in the study area during the Holocene
   Climate Optimum (8760 (base of record) to c. 5300 cal. yr BP) and peaked
   between c. 8000 and 7000 cal. yr BP. There is a general cooling trend
   from c. 7000 cal. yr BP to the present, which is indicated by an
   increase in the influence of cold Polar water-masses from the EGC and
   the EIC and a decrease in the influence of the IC. A major change in
   diatom assemblages at around 5300 cal. yr BP indicates a
   palaeoceanographic shift on the North Icelandic shelf in the
   mid-Holocene. In addition, several abrupt palaeoceanographic changes are
   distinguished. Enhanced influence of Polar waters is reflected during
   the intervals 8120-8000, 6650-6100, 4300-4100, 3000-2700, 1300-1100 and
   600-200 cal. yr BP. The palaeoceanographic indication of the diatom
   record of core MD99-2275 is consistent with the indication of other
   environmental parameters from the same core, such as benthic and
   planktonic foraminifera as well as magnetic properties, and the results
   are also consistent with palaeoclimatic records from adjacent areas
   around Iceland and in the North Atlantic region.

AB The Silene mollissima (L.) Pers. aggregate is part of section
   Siphonomorpha Otth. and currently comprises 11 narrow endemic species of
   the Western Mediterranean Basin. Three of these taxa (S. velutina Pourr.
   ex Loisel, S. ichnusae Brullo, De Marco & De Marco f., and S. badaroi
   Breistr.) have a distribution range centred in the northern Tyrrhenian
   area and occurring in coastal habitats. Inter- and intra-specific
   variability in the responses to light, constant (5-25 degrees C) and
   alternating temperatures (25/10 degrees C), salt (NaCl, 0-600 mmol/L),
   and levels of nitrate (KNO3, 20 mmol/L) under salt stress, as well as
   recovery of seed germination were evaluated for these species to more
   effectively support their in-situ and ex-situ conservation. Our results
   highlighted that the seeds of these three taxa were nondormant, and that
   light significantly improved their rate of germination, which was higher
   (>80%) at low temperatures (5-15 degrees C) and under the alternating
   temperature regime (25/10 degrees C), but decreased significantly at the
   highest temperature tested (25 degrees C). Seeds from Silene velutina
   and S. ichnusae germinated in up to 300 mmol/L NaCl, and S. badaroi
   germinated in up to 100 mmol/L. For all of the species except S.
   badaroi, salt did not affect seed viability, and recovery germination
   did not decrease with increasing salinity and temperature.
   Interpopulation variability, both in salt tolerance and recovery
   germination, was detected for S. velutina. The addition of KNO3 did not
   affect germination or recovery germination under salt conditions. The
   lack of effect from KNO3 suggests that nutrient availability is not a
   requirement for seed germination in these species. Our results show that
   all species experience an optimum period of germination during
   autumn-winter, which is when water availability is highest and soil
   salinity levels are minimal because of the Mediterranean rainfalls, but
   seeds from S. velutina and S. ichnusae will germinate up until spring.

AB The understanding of life-history responses to increased temperature is
   helpful for evaluating the potential of species for tackling future
   climate change. Herein, adult southern grass lizards, Takydromus
   sexlineatus, were maintained under two thermal regimes simulating
   current thermal environment and a 4 degrees C warming scenario to
   determine the effects of experimental warming on female reproduction and
   offspring phenotypes. Experimental warming caused females to oviposit
   earlier and more frequently; however, it did not affect other
   reproductive traits, including clutch size, egg mass and clutch mass.
   Accelerated embryonic development and energy accumulation rate might
   have occurred in warmed females. Maternal warming appeared to increase
   early embryonic mortality, but did not shift hatchling size and
   locomotor performance. Embryos of oviparous lizards might be more
   vulnerable to climate change at early stages than at later stages. The
   impacts of climate change in oviparous lizards might be adverse in the
   longer term because of the shift in pre-ovipositional embryo viability,
   which possibly led to a decreased number of hatchlings.

   and germination rate deceased rapidly when the photoperiod was increased
   under 400 &mu;mol&BULL;m(-2)&BULL;s(-1). Only 49.2% of seeds germinated

AB Increasing research has attempted to clarify the links between animal
   personality and physiology. However, the mechanisms driving this
   association remain largely unknown, and knowledge of how ecological
   factors may affect its direction and strength is scant. In this study,
   we quantified variation in the association between exploratory behavior,
   basal metabolic rate (BMR), and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) in
   rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) inhabiting desert,
   Mediterranean, and cold-temperate climates. We found that the
   exploratory behavior score was highest in birds from the cold-temperate
   site, which was characterized by a moderate level of ecological
   variability (seasonality). Moreover, the association between exploratory
   behavior and physiological variables differed among localities. Only
   birds from the Mediterranean site showed a positive correlation between
   exploratory behavior and BMR. We found no association between
   exploration and TEWL at any study site. Our findings suggest that
   differences in the ecological conditions experienced by each sparrow
   population result in a particular combination of behavioral and
   physiological traits. An understanding of this intraspecific variation
   along ecological gradients provides unique insights into how specific
   ecological conditions affect the coupling of behavioral and
   physiological traits and the mechanisms underlying that relationship.

AB Comparative physiological research on reptilies has focused primarily on
   the understanding of mechanisms of the control of breathing as they
   relate to respiratory gases or temperature itself. Comparatively less
   research has been done on the possible link between breathing and
   thermoregulation. Reptiles possess remarkable thermoregulatory
   capabilities, making use of behavioural and physiological mechanisms to
   regulate body temperature. The presence of thermal panting and gaping in
   numerous reptiles, coupled with the existence of head-body temperature
   differences, suggests that head temperature may be the primary regulated
   variable rather than body temperature. This review examines the
   preponderance of head and body temperature differences in reptiles, the
   occurrence of breathing patterns that possess putative thermoregulatory
   roles, and the propensity for head and brain temperature to be
   controlled by reptiles, particularly at higher temperatures. The
   available evidence suggests that these thermoregulatory breathing
   patterns are indeed present, though primarily in arid-dwelling reptiles.
   More importantly, however, it appears that the respiratory mechanisms
   that have the capacity to cool evolved initially in reptiles, perhaps as
   regulatory mechanisms for preventing overheating of the brain. Examining
   the control of these breathing patterns and their efficacy at regulating
   head or brain temperature may shed light on the evolution of
   thermoregulatory mechanisms in other vertebrates, namely the endothermic
   mammals and birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   legumes and its parasitoid Aphidius ervi is regarded as a successful
   biocontrol agent. In this study, we report a greater survival rate of
   parasitized aphids compared with unparasitized ones, after exposure to a
   very high temperature (39 degrees C for 30 min). After the heat shock,
   the survival of unparasitized aphids decreases according to their age at
   the heat shock treatment, suggesting a different adaptation of the aphid
   life stage to the different microclimatic conditions they experience.
   Survival of parasitized aphids does not change according to the time of
   the heat shock treatment, but it is always significantly higher compared
   with the unparasitized ones. Parasitized aphids are very quickly
   subjected to a wide range of physiological modifications and the
   observed increased survival could be a consequence of these
   modifications before the heat shock treatment. The possible explanations
   as well as the possible adaptive nature of the observed phenomenon are
   discussed.

AB Salinities in some normally-closed estuaries in the central south coast
   of Western Australia are now frequently becoming highly elevated. This
   is due to: (1) high evaporation rates in water volumes that, by summer,
   are already low as a result of atypically dry winters; and (2) increased
   salt run-off following vegetation clearing in the catchments. A few
   black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) died in the basin and lower reaches
   of the main tributary of Culham inlet when salinities reached similar to
   77 and 67, respectively, and an estimated 1.3 million black bream died
   in the tributary during the next two months when salinities continued to
   increase. All black bream in the basin and the lower reaches of the
   tributary of another estuary were apparently killed when salinities
   reached similar to 83-85. It is proposed that A. butcheri becomes
   stressed at salinities of 60 and typically die before they reach similar
   to 85. In both estuaries, a rock bar in the tributary prevented black
   bream from moving to refugia in upstream areas where salinities were
   lower.

AB Cold tolerance is a key determinant of insect distribution and
   abundance, and thermal acclimation can strongly influence organismal
   stress tolerance phenotypes, particularly in small ectotherms like
   Drosophila. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular and
   biochemical mechanisms that confer such impressive plasticity. Here, we
   use high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to compare the transcriptomes
   and metabolomes of D. melanogaster acclimated as adults to warm
   (rearing) (21.5 degrees C) or cold conditions (6 degrees C). Cold
   acclimation improved cold tolerance and led to extensive biological
   reorganization: almost one third of the transcriptome and nearly half of
   the metabolome were differentially regulated. There was overlap in the
   metabolic pathways identified via transcriptomics and metabolomics, with
   proline and glutathione metabolism being the most strongly-supported
   metabolic pathways associated with increased cold tolerance. We discuss
   several new targets in the study of insect cold tolerance (e.g. dopamine
   signaling and Na+-driven transport), but many previously identified
   candidate genes and pathways (e.g. heat shock proteins, Ca2+ signaling,
   and ROS detoxification) were also identified in the present study, and
   our results are thus consistent with and extend the current
   understanding of the mechanisms of insect chilling tolerance.

AB Relationships between meteorological factors and airborne pollen

   cross-correlation analyses to test the relationships between daily

   speed) and airborne pollen concentration, diversity (number of families
   and Shannon and Simpson diversity indices) and evenness (Pielou index)
   in an Apennine high-altitude site (Gran Sasso Massif, 2117 m elevation).
   In contrast to patterns observed at low altitudes, the temperature had a
   negative correlation with pollen abundance and diversity, whereas
   humidity had a positive correlation. The unexpected negative
   correlations with temperature can be explained with the particular
   position of our sampling site. Wind speed was positively correlated with
   pollen diversity and abundance in the short term, which can be explained
   by the fact that higher wind speed promotes both primary emission of
   pollen from the anthers and subsequent re-suspension. Evenness and wind
   speed were negatively correlated in the short term because of the
   different response of different species to meteorological conditions. In
   the longer term, the average concentrations of the various taxa tend to
   reach similar values, leading to increased values of diversity. Our
   finding of a decrease in pollen emission with increasing temperature has
   important implications for the study of the impacts of global change on
   high-altitude plant communities. We also detected a high abundance of
   Cupressaceae/Taxaceae pollen, a reflection of the expansion of
   thermophilic species, such as Juniperus, due to climate change.

AB The palette of tools for perturbation of neural activity is continually
   expanding. On the forefront of this expansion is magnetogenetics, where
   ion channels are genetically engineered to be closely coupled to the
   iron-storage protein ferritin. Initial reports on magnetogenetics have
   sparked a vigorous debate on the plausibility of physical mechanisms of
   ion channel activation by means of external magnetic fields. The
   criticism leveled against magnetogenetics as being physically
   implausible is based on the specific assumptions about the magnetic spin
   configurations of iron in ferritin. I consider here a wider range of
   possible spin configurations of iron in ferritin and the consequences
   these might have in magnetogenetics. I propose several new
   magneto-mechanical and magneto-thermal mechanisms of ion channel
   activation that may clarify some of the mysteries that presently
   challenge our understanding of the reported biological experiments.
   Finally, I present some additional puzzles that will require further
   theoretical and experimental investigation.

AB We designed artificial models of biological membranes by deposition of
   synthetic glycolipid membrane multilayers on planar silicon substrates.
   In contrast to commonly used phospholipid membranes, this offers the
   unique possibility to study the influence of membrane-bound saccharide
   chains (cell glycocalix) on the membrane mechanics. Taking advantage of
   the planar sample geometry, we carried out specular and off-specular
   neutron scattering experiments to identify out-of-plane and in-plane
   scattering vector components. By considering the effects of finite
   sample sizes, we were able to simulate the measured two-dimensional
   reciprocal space maps within the framework of smectic liquid-crystal
   theory. The results obtained both at controlled humidity and in bulk
   water clearly indicate that a subtle change in the molecular chemistry
   of the saccharides strongly influences intermembrane interactions and
   membrane bending rigidities.

AB Theory predicts that cold environments will select for strategies that
   enhance the growth of ectotherms, such as early emergence from nests and
   more efficient use of resources. We used a common garden experiment to
   detect parallel clines in rates of embryonic growth and development by
   eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). Using realistic thermal
   conditions, we measured growth efficiencies and incubation periods of
   lizards from five populations representing two distinct clades. In both
   clades, embryos from cold environments (Indiana, New Jersey, and
   Virginia) grew more efficiently and hatched earlier than embryos from
   warm environments (Florida and South Carolina). Because eggs from cold
   environments were larger than eggs from warm environments, we
   experimentally miniaturized eggs from one population (Virginia) to
   determine whether rapid growth and development were caused by a greater
   maternal investment. Embryos in miniaturized eggs grew as efficiently
   and incubated for the same duration as embryos in unmanipulated eggs.
   Taken together, our results suggest countergradient variation has
   evolved at least twice in S. undulatus.

AB Threshold-based thermal time models provide insight into the
   physiological switch from the dormant to the non-dormant germinating
   seed. This approach was used to quantify the different growth responses
   of the embryo of seeds purported to have morphophysiological dormancy
   (MPD) through the complex phases of dormancy release and germination.
   Aquilegia barbaricina seeds were incubated at constant temperatures
   (10-25 degrees C) and 25/10 degrees C, without pre-treatment, after
   warm+cold stratification (W+C) and GA(3) treatment. Embryo growth was
   assessed and the time of testa and endosperm rupture scored. Base
   temperatures (T-b) and thermal times for 50% ((50)) of embryo growth and
   seed germination were calculated. W+C enabled slow embryo growth. W+C
   and GA(3) promoted rapid embryo growth and subsequent radicle emergence.
   The embryo internal growth base temperature (T-be) was ca. 5 degrees C
   for W+C and GA(3)-treated seeds. GA(3) treatment also resulted in
   similar T-b estimates for radicle emergence. The thermal times for
   embryo growth ((e50)) and germination ((g50)) were four- to six-fold
   longer in the presence of GA(3) compared to W+C.A.barbaricina is
   characterised by a multi-step seed germination. The slow embryo growth
   during W+C reflects continuation of the maternal programme of
   development, whilst the thermal kinetics of both embryo and radicle
   growth after the removal of physiological dormancy are distinctly
   different. The effects of W+C on the multiphasic germination response in
   MPD seeds are only partially mimicked by 250mgl(-1) GA(3). The thermal
   time approach could be a valid tool to model thermal kinetics of embryo
   growth and radicle protrusion.

AB Western Nepal has experienced a severe drought in the past two decades,
   but observation records across Nepal are too short to place the recent
   drought in a longer context to understand the full range of natural
   variability in the climate system. In the present study we have
   collected tree core samples of Tsuga dumosa from two sites, Chhetti and
   Ranghadi, in the Api Nampa Conservation Area of the western Nepal
   Himalayas to understand drought variation for the past three centuries.
   We have developed a 357-year (AD 1657-2013) tree-ring chronology. The
   tree growth-climate response analysis revealed a stronger positive
   correlation with spring (March-May) standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI01) (r = 0.523, p < 0.01) than
   precipitation (r = 0.459, p < 0.01), self-calibrating Palmer drought
   severity index (scPDSI) (r = 0.250, p < 0.01), or temperature (r =
   -0.486, p < 0.01). Stronger positive correlation with SPEI01 indicates
   moisture availability is the limiting factor for the growth of this
   species on these sites. Based on this growth-climate response we
   reconstructed spring SPEI from AD 1707 to 2013 for the region. The
   reconstruction showed several dry and wet episodes indicating no
   persistent climate trend within the past three centuries. The current
   drought is one of the four most severe in our 307-year record.

AB We explore the role that biological processes play in the patchiness of

   modify the variance in plankton density as a function of spatial scale
   (i.e. the variance spectrum) from that expected if the biota were merely
   passive tracers. Using an approximate model for two limiting cases of
   turbulence - the inertial subrange and two-dimensional turbulence - we
   consider a simple predator - prey formulation for interacting
   populations in a turbulent ocean. No simple generalizations emerge. The
   interacting populations 'redden' (i.e. more variance at large scale) the
   spectrum of the passive tracers in the inertial subrange. Conversely,
   the interaction 'whitens' (i.e. less variance at large scale) the
   passive tracer spectrum for two-dimensional turbulence. This mirrors
   results in terrestrial environments.

AB Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, brown trout Salmo trutta (including the
   anadromous form, sea trout) and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus
   (including anadromous fish) provide important commercial and sports
   fisheries in Western Europe. As water temperature increases as a result
   of climate change, quantitative information on the thermal requirements
   of these three species is essential so that potential problems can be
   anticipated by those responsible for the conservation and sustainable
   management of the fisheries and the maintenance of biodiversity in
   freshwater ecosystems. Part I compares the temperature limits for
   survival, feeding and growth. Salmo salar has the highest temperature
   tolerance, followed by S. trutta and finally S. alpinus. For all three
   species, the temperature tolerance for alevins is slightly lower than
   that for parr and smolts, and the eggs have the lowest tolerance; this
   being the most vulnerable life stage to any temperature increase,
   especially for eggs of S. alpinus in shallow water. There was little
   evidence to support local thermal adaptation, except in very cold rivers
   (mean annual temperature < 6 center dot 5 degrees C). Part II
   illustrates the importance of developing predictive models, using data
   from a long-term study (1967-2000) of a juvenile anadromous S. trutta
   population. Individual-based models predicted the emergence period for
   the fry. Mean values over 34 years revealed a large variation in the
   timing of emergence with c. 2 months between extreme values. The
   emergence time correlated significantly with the North Atlantic
   Oscillation Index, indicating that interannual variations in emergence
   were linked to more general changes in climate. Mean stream temperatures
   increased significantly in winter and spring at a rate of 0 center dot
   37 degrees C per decade, but not in summer and autumn, and led to an
   increase in the mean mass of pre-smolts. A growth model for S. trutta
   was validated by growth data from the long-term study and predicted
   growth under possible future conditions. Small increases (< 2 center dot
   5 degrees C) in winter and spring would be beneficial for growth with 1
   year-old smolts being more common. Water temperatures would have to
   increase by c. 4 degrees C in winter and spring, and 3 degrees C in
   summer and autumn before they had a marked negative effect on trout
   growth.

AB Plants show remarkable developmental plasticity to survive in a
   continually changing environment. One example is their capability to
   adjust flowering time in response to environmental changes. Ambient
   growth temperature, which is strongly affected by global temperature
   changes, has a profound effect on flowering time. However, those effects
   have been largely ignored in research. Recent molecular genetic studies
   of Arabidopsis as a model system have implicated several genes, and have
   identified a molecular mechanism underlying the responses of plants to
   changes in ambient temperature. Here, we describe recent discoveries
   related to ambient temperature signaling and the control of flowering
   time in Arabidopsis. We also discuss current perspectives on how plants
   sense and respond to such changes.

   crank-arm peak power (10s Wingate test), and time to complete 25m

AB Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) is a unique form of phenotypic plasticity
   which confers survival advantages at low temperature. The fitness costs
   of RCH are generally poorly elucidated and are important to
   understanding the evolution of plastic physiology. This study examined
   whether RCH responses, induced by ecologically relevant diel temperature
   fluctuations, carry metabolic, survival, or fecundity costs. We
   predicted that potential costs in RCH would be manifested as differences
   in metabolic rate, fecundity, or survival in flies which have hardened
   versus those which have not, or flies that have experienced more RCH
   events would show greater costs than those which have experienced fewer
   events. One group of flies cooled to 10 degrees C for 2 h for 11
   consecutive days experienced daily RCH (Hardened), whereas the other
   group exposed to 15 degrees C for the same 2-h period each day formed a
   Control group. Hardened flies had higher survival at 5 degrees C for 2 h
   than control flies (69 +/- 9% vs. 44 +/- 19%, P = 0.04). Hardened flies
   showed no metabolic or fecundity costs, but had reduced average survival
   (P = 0.0403). Thus, a major cost to repeated low temperature exposures
   in Ceratitis capitata is through direct mortality caused by chilling
   injury, although this appears not to be a direct cost of RCH.

   C in 10h. Gender and early adult age did not affect low-temperature
   tolerance of FCM.
   (4) Using a range of non-lethal, low- and high-temperature
   pre-treatments, FCM survival could not be increased (p>0.84) and thus
   limited evidence for rapid cold hardening was found. These results are
   discussed with respect to microclimate temperatures in typical FCM

AB Temperature plays a major role in controlling species' distributions,
   and small-scale variation in the thermal environment are potentially an
   important factor that governs distributions on a local scale. For
   untangling the roles of behavioral and physiological adaptations on
   species' distribution at a small-scale level, we carried out a
   comparative study of two mudflat snails (genus Cerithidea) by
   determining these congeners' burying behavior, lethal temperature,
   cardiac performance and heat-shock protein (hsp70) gene expression.
   These two sympatric snails occupy different microhabitats on the upper
   intertidal mudflat. During periods of emersion, C. cingulata inhabits
   the open mudflat and C. largillierti usually aggregates around small
   rocks on the upper intertidal mudflat. Our results indicate that the two
   Cerithidea congeners show different behavioral and physiological
   responses to high temperature. Compared to C. largillierti, C. cingulata
   prefers to bury into the mud, has a higher thermal limit and a higher
   level of inducible expression of hsp70 mRNA, implying important roles of
   behavioral and physiological adaptations to the harsh thermal
   environment on the open mudflat. Furthermore, results of generalized
   additive modelling (GAM) analysis of cardiac performance and coefficient
   of variation (CV) of hsp70 mRNA expression showed high inter-individual
   variation in C. cingulata. These results highlight the importance of
   behavioral and physiological adaptions in sympatric species'
   distributions on the mudflat and help to shed light on the mechanisms of
   how small-scale differences in the thermal environment shape sympatric
   species' distributions.

AB There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central
   Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed
   and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year
   variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big
   Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation
   greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns
   in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum
   greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest
   observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion
   of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year
   with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments,
   2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the
   potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland
   production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the
   Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for
   conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid
   climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive
   rangelands at the expense of forested lands.

AB Climate is an important factor limiting tree distributions and
   adaptation to different thermal environments may influence how tree
   populations respond to climate warming. Given the current rate of
   warming, it has been hypothesized that tree populations in warmer, more
   thermally stable climates may have limited capacity to respond
   physiologically to warming compared to populations from cooler, more
   seasonal climates. We determined in a controlled environment how several
   provenances of widely distributed Eucalyptus tereticornis and E.grandis
   adjusted their photosynthetic capacity to +3.5 degrees C warming along
   their native distribution range (similar to 16-38 degrees S) and whether
   climate of seed origin of the provenances influenced their response to
   different growth temperatures. We also tested how temperature optima
   (T-opt) of photosynthesis and J(max) responded to higher growth
   temperatures. Our results showed increased photosynthesis rates at a
   standardized temperature with warming in temperate provenances, while
   rates in tropical provenances were reduced by about 40% compared to
   their temperate counterparts. Temperature optima of photosynthesis
   increased as provenances were exposed to warmer growth temperatures.
   Both species had similar to 30% reduced photosynthetic capacity in
   tropical and subtropical provenances related to reduced leaf nitrogen
   and leaf Rubisco content compared to temperate provenances. Tropical
   provenances operated closer to their thermal optimum and came within 3%
   of the T-opt of J(max) during the daily temperature maxima. Hence,
   further warming may negatively affect C uptake and tree growth in warmer
   climates, whereas eucalypts in cooler climates may benefit from moderate
   warming.

AB While average temperature is likely to increase in most locations on
   Earth, many places will simultaneously experience higher variability in
   temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables. Although
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists widely recognize the potential
   impacts of changes in average climatic conditions, relatively little
   attention has been paid to the potential impacts of changes in climatic
   variability and extremes. We review the evidence on the impacts of
   increased climatic variability and extremes on physiological, ecological
   and evolutionary processes at multiple levels of biological
   organization, from individuals to populations and communities. Our
   review indicates that climatic variability can have profound influences
   on biological processes at multiple scales of organization. Responses to
   increased climatic variability and extremes are likely to be complex and
   cannot always be generalized, although our conceptual and methodological
   toolboxes allow us to make informed predictions about the likely
   consequences of such climatic changes. We conclude that climatic
   variability represents an important component of climate that deserves
   further attention.

AB Background: The gametogenic cycle of Crassostrea gigas, a species
   imported into the Mediterranean for aquaculture, has been studied (May
   2005 to July 2006) in two contrasting habitats of Tunisia: the Bizert
   lagoon, where oyster farms have been developed since 1970, and the Gulf
   of Tunis, where oysters have been experimentally farmed during this
   study, to assess the potential of this latter marine area for sustaining
   oyster-culture.
   Results: The sexual cycle of the species was described through the
   histological examination of the gonads, the estimation of oocytes
   diameter, and the assessment of its condition and gonadal condition
   indices. The applied techniques gave similar results. The gametogenic
   cycle of C. gigas was precocious and more intense in oysters farmed
   within the lagoon than in the marine area, considering as well gonadal
   growth, maturation stages and gametes release.
   Conclusions: The obtained results are probably related with the
   different environmental conditions of the studied habitats, temperature
   and food supply, in particular. The sexual cycle of the species was
   successfully completed in the marine area, stressing the invasive
   character of C. gigas.

AB Aim: Spatial synchrony in plankton is imperfectly understood yet may
   have far-reaching implications, for example for carbon export to the
   deep ocean. Several techniques have been used to describe patterns of
   spatial synchrony, from correlation coefficients to spectral methods.
   Some studies have used temporally extensive data sets to identify causes
   of synchrony. This study instead uses the exceptional spatial extent
   provided by remotely sensed data to describe, for the first time as far
   as we know, geographical patterns of synchrony in marine phytoplankton.
   We use these patterns to illuminate drivers of synchrony and of its
   geography.
   Location: The oceans.
   Time period: 2003-2015.
   Major taxon: Chlorophyll a-containing phytoplankton.
   Methods: Synchrony in chlorophyll a concentrations is mapped globally.
   Spatial statistics and model selection are used to illuminate main
   statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in
   synchrony.
   Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and
   previously unmapped geography of synchrony for phytoplankton. For
   instance, synchrony was highest in the open ocean, specifically in
   gyres, and lowest in coastal regions. Spatial modelling provided the
   second main result that synchrony in sea surface temperature (SST) was a
   major statistical determinant of chlorophyll synchrony in both the
   Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, indicating a strong Moran effect, although
   possibly an indirect and/or complex one. In the Pacific Ocean, this
   effect depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed,
   providing our third result, which is that synchrony of phytoplankton and
   its geography can be time-scale specific. Synchrony of surface solar
   irradiance was not associated with synchrony of chlorophyll.
   Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to map
   geography of synchrony in marine plankton. We showed that this geography
   is pronounced. Geographical patterns illuminated determinants of
   synchrony. The geography of synchrony is a major phenomenon that has
   been little explored.

AB Microbial growth and inactivation kinetics in food can be predicted when
   the effects of food properties and environmental conditions on microbial
   responses are available. However the effects of these intrinsic and
   extrinsic variables on microbial kinetics are often obtained using
   laboratory media, and deviations between predictions and true behaviour
   might occur if the specific effect of a food product is not known or
   considered in the prediction. Therefore, knowing the food specific
   effect on microbial kinetics might not only result in a more realistic
   growth and inactivation prediction, but also extend the knowledge on
   factors influencing growth and heat resistance. In this study, growth
   predictions of Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum were
   validated in laboratory media and in milk and ham as model food
   products. A good agreement between the predicted and observed growth
   kinetics in laboratory media highlighted the possibility to predict
   mu(max) based on cardinal growth parameters obtained from OD-based
   measurement in laboratory media. Only in two conditions (BHI pH 5.5 at 7
   degrees C; and BHI pH 5.5, undissociated lactic acid concentration of 1
   mM at 7 degrees C) a possible interaction between growth limiting
   factors was observed, yet existing interaction models were not better in
   predicting growth. Growth validation in the two model foods showed that
   the food specific effects were strain dependent, which might further
   complicate accurate prediction. For both species the effect of strain
   variability on thermal inactivation was similar to the food specific
   effects, and the latter was mainly determined by the effect of ham as
   heating medium. The combination of both effects explained (almost) all
   variability found in literature, however, with some bias. (C) 2016

AB Complex environments, characterized by co-varying factors (e.g.
   temperature and food availability) may cause animals to invest resources
   differentially into fitness-related traits. Thus, experiments
   manipulating multiple environmental factors concurrently provide
   valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only
   important traits (e.g. dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also
   trait-trait interactions (e.g. trade-offs between traits). We used a
   multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant
   28 degrees C vs. 28 +/- 5 degrees C daily cycle) and food availability
   (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand
   field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found
   that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted
   survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment.
   Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy,
   we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced
   investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a
   sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that
   was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and
   food availability. We develop an experimental and statistical framework
   to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different
   life-history traits. This approach can be applied to a range of
   biological systems to investigate how environmental complexity
   influences traits and trait trade-offs.

   chemical reaction between two states, and operate in contact with a
   single heat bath of constant temperature. We discuss generic aspects of
   energy transduction such as Onsager relations in the linear response
   regime as well as the efficiency and dissipation close to and far from
   equilibrium. In the linear response regime where the system operates
   reversibly, the efficiency is in general nonzero. Studying the
   properties for specific examples of energy landscapes and transitions,
   we observe in the linear response regime that the efficiency can have a
   maximum as a function of temperature. Far from equilibrium in the fully
   irreversible regime, we find a maximum of the efficiency with values
   larger than in the linear regime for an optimal choice of the chemical
   driving force. We show that the corresponding efficiencies can be of the
   order of 50%. A simple analytical argument allows us to estimate the
   efficiency in this irreversible regime for small external forces.

AB A molecular structural mechanics (MSM) method has been implemented to
   investigate the free vibration of microtubules (MTs). The emphasis is
   placed on the effects of the configuration and the imperfect boundaries
   of MTs. It is shown that the influence of protofilament number on the
   fundamental frequency is strong, while the effect of helix-start number
   is almost negligible. The fundamental frequency is also found to
   decrease as the number of the blocked filaments at boundaries decreases.
   Subsequently, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is employed to reveal the
   physics behind the simulation results. Fitting the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   into the MSM data leads to an explicit formula for the fundamental
   frequency of MTs with various configurations and identifies a possible
   correlation between the imperfect boundary conditions and the
   length-dependent bending stiffness of MTs reported in experiments.

AB Variation in 19 traits possibly relevant for thermal adaptation was
   studied in 11 populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected in southeast
   Australia. Using stepwise multiple regression, the variation was
   compared to variation in geographic coordinates and to a set of climatic
   variables estimated for each collection site. For 13 of the traits, a
   significant part of the variation was explained by climatic variables
   and/or geographic coordinates, suggesting directional selection for
   adaptation to the environment in the majority of traits studied. In 10
   of the traits, both geographic coordinates and climatic variables
   explained significant proportions of the variation, with R-2 ranging
   from 0.075 to 0.58. Although larvae, pupae and adults of D. buzzatii
   share a common habitat, the measured traits were not correlated across
   life stages and gender. Also, there seemed to be special conditions in
   marginal populations near species borders, giving rise to nonlinear
   relations with latitude. Climate apparently does influence the adaptive
   evolution of the traits studied, but they also are affected by other
   factors that vary with latitude, longitude and distance to coast. These
   results highlight the complex challenges imposed by the environment on
   the adaptive process.

   Concomitantly with increase in water temperature (from 2 to 20 degrees C
   abundance of P. agardhii increased from 1.9 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(7)
   trichomes L-1. In autumn, in spite of temperature lower (14 degrees C)
   than in summer it was still very high. Mass development of P. agardhii
   (to 6 x 10(6) L-1 and higher) caused a severe decrease in water
   transparency (to 0.5 - 0.2 m in summer/autumn). The cyanobacterium
   density was relatively uniform within water column; only in summer
   (July) it was significantly higher (by about 30%) in surface than in
   bottom layer. From spring to autumn rnicrocystins (MCs) were mainly
   biomass-bound (up to 90 mu g MC-LR equiv. L-1), whereas the level of
   extra-cellular toxins was much lower (up to 2 mu g L-1) and relatively
   stable. Only in winter, high amounts of MCs (11.3 Pg L-1) were released
   from decaying biomass into water. The increasing concentrations of
   biomass-bound microcystins in the take water positively correlated (R-2
   = 0.9863; y = -0.1285x(2) + 7.14x) with the abundance of P. agardhii and
   the highest concentrations of the intracellular MC fraction were found
   during the exponential phase of P. agardhii growth. In addition, the
   surface-sampled biomass of P. agardhii contained in autumn 2-fold more
   MCs (2.75 mu g MC-LR equiv. per 10(6) P. agardhii trichomes) than the
   bottom-sampled one (1.41 mu g MC-LR equiv. per 10(6) trichomes). This is
   the first report showing that despite the homogenous distribution of P.
   agardhii in water column of a shallow lake, various seasonal and spatial
   distributions of both extra-cellular and intracellular fractions of
   microcystins occur.

AB Among-population variation in chill-coma onset temperature (CTmin) is
   thought to reflect natural selection for local microclimatic conditions.
   However, few studies have investigated the evolutionary importance of
   cold tolerance limits in natural populations. Here, using a
   common-environment approach, we show pronounced variation in CTmin (+/-
   4 degrees C) across the geographic range of a nonoverwintering crop
   pest, Eldana saccharina. The outcomes of this study provide two notable
   results in the context of evolved chill-coma variation: (1) CTmin
   differs significantly between geographic lines and is significantly
   positively correlated with local climates, and (2) there is a stable
   genetic architecture underlying CTmin trait variation, likely
   representing four key genes. Crosses between the most and least
   cold-tolerant geographic lines confirmed a genetic component to CTmin
   trait variation. Slower developmental time in the most cold-tolerant
   population suggests that local adaptation involves fitness costs;
   however, it confers fitness benefits in that environment. A significant
   reduction in phenotypic plasticity in the laboratory population suggests
   that plasticity of this trait is costly to maintain but also likely
   necessary for field survival. These results are significant for
   understanding field population adaption to novel environments, whereas
   further work is needed to dissect the underlying mechanism and gene(s)
   responsible.

AB Loxoscelism is a health problem caused by the bite of spiders of the
   genus Loxosceles. In Chile all cases are attributable to Loxosceles
   laeta. It has been suggested that the spitting spider Scytodes globula
   may be a predator of L laeta and control its population, which is only
   possible if they share the microhabitat. This study compared the thermal
   preferences and tolerances of the two species. Later, spiders acclimated
   to 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C were exposed to decreasing and
   increasing temperatures to determine the lower and upper critical
   temperatures. The preferred temperatures were lower during the morning,
   but there were no differences between the species. The thermal niche
   breadths were similar for the species, with a large overlap. Both
   species showed tolerance to extreme temperatures, but L laeta showed
   greater tolerance to low temperatures. Both species showed acclimation
   of the lower critical temperatures to changes in acclimation
   temperatures. The similarity of preferred and tolerated temperatures was
   partly an expected fact, since the species share the same macrohabitat;
   these spider species are very common in domestic environments of central
   Chile. However, the results imply that their microhabitat choices are
   also very similar, indicating a high probability of meeting and
   predation, which could have important consequences in loxoscelism
   epidemiology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The homokaryotic stage of the basidiomycete lifecycle is generally
   considered to be short lived, although there is little experimental
   evidence relating to their longevity in the field. The vast majority of
   studies on basidiomycete ecology have used only heterokaryons. The few
   investigations comparing related homokaryons and heterokaryons have
   revealed no overall trend in differences of extension rate, wood decay
   or competitive ability. For a rare species the homokaryotic phase may be
   of greater importance than in common species as it is likely to last
   longer. Hericium coralloides, a rare wood decay basidiomycete, was used
   to investigate differences between homokaryons and heterokaryons in
   terms of extension rate and combative ability. Fifteen homokaryons from
   three fruit bodies and five heterokaryons (obtained by fruit body tissue
   isolation) were compared at 5-35 degrees C on malt agar for extension
   rate, and paired against heterokaryons of 13 wood decay species to
   assess combative ability. Homokaryons were paired to create ten
   artificial heterokaryons whose extension rate at 10 and 20 degrees C was
   compared to parental rates. There were some significant differences in
   extension rates between homokaryons and natural heterokaryons, between
   homokaryons and heterokaryons created artificially from homokaryons, and
   between homokaryons from different fruit bodies, but no consistent
   trends. Homokaryons proved more combative than heterokaryons, which was
   assessed quantitatively as well as qualitatively using a scoring system
   for outcome of each pairing. Results are discussed in relation to
   previous findings and in an ecological context, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd

AB In recent years, the phenomenon of global warming and its implications
   for the future of the human race have been intensively studied. In
   contrast, few quantitative studies have been attempted on the notable
   effects of past climatic changes upon human societies. This study
   explored the relationship between climatic change and war in China by
   comparing high-resolution paleo-climatic reconstructions with known war
   incidences in China in the last millennium. War frequencies showed a
   cyclic pattern that closely followed the global paleo-temperature
   changes. Strong and significant correlations were found between climatic
   change, war occurrence, harvest level, population size and dynastic
   transition. During cold phases, China suffered more often from frequent
   wars, population decline and dynastic changes. The quantitative analyses
   suggested that the reduction of thermal energy input during a cold phase
   would lower the land carrying capacity in the traditional agrarian
   society, and the population size, with significant accretions accrued in
   the previous warm phase, could not be sustained by the shrinking
   resource base. The stressed human-nature relationship generated a 'push
   force', leading to more frequent wars between states, regions and
   tribes, which could lead to the collapse of dynasties and collapses of
   human population size. War frequencies varied according to geographical
   locations (North, Central and South China) due to spatial variations in
   the physical environment and hence differential response to climatic
   change. Moreover, war occurrences demonstrated an obvious time lag after
   an episode of temperature fall, and the three geographical regions
   experienced different length of time lags. This research also shows that
   human population increases and collapses were correlated with the
   climatic phases and the social instabilities that were induced by
   climate changes during the last millennium. The findings proposed a new
   interpretation of human-nature relationship in the past, with
   implications for the impacts of anomalous global warming on future human
   conflicts.

AB The Wadden Sea experiences a warming climate with water temperatures
   having increased by about 2 degrees C during the last 50 years. We
   studied possible effects of this temperature rise on the dynamics of a
   cockle (Cerastoderma edule) population in the westernmost part of the
   Wadden Sea by monitoring the numbers of aged cockles since the early
   1970s. We found increased rates of mortality at extreme climatic
   conditions. In particular, survival declined to close-to-0 in all age
   classes in severe winters. In the hottest summers, survival was somewhat
   reduced in older (> 1 year old) cockles. On the other hand, recruitment
   was enhanced after cold winters, but this was not a direct effect of low
   temperatures as it was mainly caused by a reduction of the abundance of
   predators on small spat. The observed decline of the long-term trend in
   recruitment was compensated by an increasing trend of winter survival,
   resulting in an absence of any long-term trend in adult numbers.

AB Numerous proxy climate reconstructions have been developed for Europe,
   but there are still regions with limited data of this kind. One region
   is the Balkan Peninsula, which is characterized by complex interactions
   between mountains and climate. We present and discuss two tree-ring
   chronologies-a 758-year-long one of Pinus heldreichii Christ and
   340-year-long one of Pinus peuce Griseb. from treeline locations in the
   Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria. Climate-growth relationships were computed
   with bootstrap correlation functions and their consistency over time
   assessed by calculating the correlations over shortened periods. In
   addition, we reviewed and analyzed climate situations in years with
   unusually narrow or wide tree rings. Both species were negatively
   influenced by previous summer drought conditions and cold winters. Early
   summer temperatures were positively correlated with P. peuce radial
   growth, whereas P. heldreichii displayed dependence on summer
   precipitation. In the second half of the twentieth century, the P.
   heldreichii trees displayed higher sensitivity to summer drought, which
   was probably a result of increased summer temperatures and decreased
   winter precipitation. Our findings contribute to more reliable proxy
   climate records for the region.

   larvae was similar in all 3 yr at approx. 360 x 10(9) Stage I larvae per
   year. The estimated production in the eastern Irish Sea was 5% of the
   value for the western Irish Sea. This corresponded well to the sizes of
   the fisheries and the relative areas of the mud patches. Larvae in both
   areas were found to hatch over 51/2; wk, centred on the first week in
   May. The time lag between onset of production of each stage reflected
   the estimated stage durations, but the lag between maximum production of
   each stage was much shorter than expected.

AB Annual accumulation records covering 1935 to 2004 were reconstructed
   using Geladaindong ice core in the source of Yangtze River. A
   significant positive correlation between annual accumulation and
   precipitation from nearby meteorological stations was found, suggesting
   ice core accumulation could be taken as a precipitation proxy in the
   region. In the past 70 years, precipitation in the Geladaindong region
   was low from 1930s to early 1960s, and the lowest value occurred in the
   later 1950s. Since 1960s, precipitation increased dramatically and
   reached the maximum around 1980s, then decreased slightly in 1990s. By
   using Mann-Kendall rank statistical test method, a change point for
   precipitation was determined in 1967. Analysis of the atmospheric
   circulation over the Tibetan Plateau suggested that, compared with the
   southwest wind during the low precipitation period (before 1967), it
   extended about 2 latitudes northward during high precipitation period
   (after 1967). Moreover, during the high precipitation, the trough over
   the Bal Karshi Lake was also enhanced, and both the meridional wind and
   vapor transporting displayed a remarkable aggrandizement.

AB Aim Most of the fundamental questions in conservation biogeography
   require the description of species geographic boundaries and the
   identification of discrete biological units within these boundaries.
   International conservation efforts and institutions rely mainly on
   traditional taxonomic approaches for defining these boundaries,
   resulting in significant cryptic diversity going undetected and often
   extinct. Here, we combine high-throughput genomic data with publicly
   available environmental data to identify cryptic diversity in the
   threatened bird's-eye primrose (Primula farinosa). We aim to
   characterize evolutionary lineages and test whether they co-occur with
   changes in environmental conditions. These lineages can be used as
   intraspecific units for conservation to enhance assessments regarding
   the status of threatened species. Location Europe and temperate Asia
   (latitude, 40-65 degrees N; longitude, 10 degrees E-115 degrees W).
   Methods We genotyped 93 individuals from 71 populations at 1,220 loci
   (4,089 SNPs) across the Eurasian distribution of P. farinosa. We used
   phylogenomic and population structure approaches to identify
   intraspecific lineages. We further extracted statistically derived and
   remotely sensed environmental information, that is land cover, climate
   and soil characteristics, to define the biotic and abiotic environment
   inhabited by each lineage and test for niche similarities among
   lineages. Additionally, we tested for isolation by distance among
   populations and applied linear and polynomial regressions to identify
   lineage-environment associations. Results Analyses of genomic data
   revealed six major lineages within P. farinosa corresponding to distinct
   geographic areas. Niche similarity tests indicated that lineages occupy
   distinct abiotic and biotic space. Isolation by distance indicated that
   geography alone cannot explain genetic divergence within P. farinosa,
   while lineage-environment associations suggested potential adaptation to
   different abiotic conditions across lineages. However, relationships
   with the land cover classes, a proxy for habitat, were weaker. Main
   conclusion Our results highlight the need for incorporating
   intraspecific diversity in global assessments of species conservation
   status and the utility of genomic and publicly available environmental
   data in conservation biogeography.

AB The sediment fill of Haukadalsvatn, a lake in northwest Iceland,
   preserves a record of environmental change since deglaciation, 13 ka
   ago. The rapid sedimentation rate over the past 2 ka (ca. 4 m ka(-1))
   provides a high-resolution archive of late Holocene environmental
   change. Physical and chemical environmental proxies extracted from cores
   from the Haukadalsvatn sediment fill provide a reconstruction of
   sub-decadal-scale climate variability in Iceland over the past 2 ka.
   Over this interval biogenic silica (BSi) reflects warm April-May
   temperatures, whereas total organic carbon (TOC) peaks represent an
   increased flux of carbon to the lake from eolian-derived soil erosion
   following periods of cold summers accompanied by dry, windy winters. The
   proxy-based temperature reconstructions show a broad interval of warmth
   through Medieval times, but this warmth is punctuated by multi-decadal
   cold intervals. The transition into the Little Ice Age occurred in two
   steps, with initial summer cooling 1250-1300 AD, and a more severe drop
   in summer temperatures between 1450 and 1500 AD; both are periods of
   severe explosive volcanism. Multi-decadal patterns of cold and warm
   conditions have some characteristics of a North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO)-like signal, but instrumental records and proxy-based
   reconstructions of the NAO index contain little power in the frequencies
   most strongly expressed in our data set. Although severe soil erosion in
   Iceland is frequently equated with settlement, our reconstructions
   indicate that soil erosion began several centuries before settlement,
   whereas for several centuries after settlement, when summer temperatures
   were relatively high, there was little or no soil erosion. Only during
   the transition into and during the Little Ice Age did soil erosion
   become a major feature of the record.

   markedly lower growth than during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
   This observation raises the question of forest persistence on certain
   sites of lowland central and eastern Alaska. We analyzed white spruce
   growth across a 36-site network (540 trees) on three major river
   floodplains in boreal Alaska along a longitudinal gradient from eastern
   Interior to the southwest tree limit to test for the presence of tree
   growth patterns and climate sensitivities. Chronologies are compared for
   temperature sensitivity at both stand and individual tree levels, using
   data from Bethel, McGrath, and Fairbanks NWS stations during the common
   period of 1952 2001. Cross-dated stand-level ring width chronologies
   indicate three regions of common signal in tree growth across the
   gradient. Temperature sensitivity of stand- and individual-tree
   chronologies is spatially coherent. Most downriver chronologies
   correlate positively with spring mean monthly temperatures (MMT) at
   Bethel, mid- and upriver chronologies correlate negatively with MMT of
   May and previous year July at either McGrath or Fairbanks, and an area
   in between is a mixed population of positive and negative responders. In
   downriver positive responders, recent increases from suboptimal cool
   temperatures accelerated tree growth, while in mid- and upriver negative
   responders, recent increases from optimal or above-optimal temperatures
   decreased growth. Fairbanks negative responders are also negatively
   correlated with a 200-yr index of recorded and reconstructed Fairbanks
   summer temperatures, and recent sustained record high summer
   temperatures are associated with the lowest relative growth. Until the
   1940s, absolute growth rate of negative responders was greater than
   positive responders, but from the 1970s the positive responders grew
   more. These results explain why northern ring width samples can display
   opposite temperature sensitivity and contribute to understanding recent
   "divergence" or loss of temperature sensitivity in a changing climate.
   We find that July MMT and annual precipitation at Fairbanks are now
   outside the limits that previously characterized the North American
   distribution of white spruce, and are near the reported physiological
   limits of the species. Our results of the spatial and temporal change of
   white spruce temperature sensitivity provide strong empirical evidence
   of previously proposed early stage biome shift in boreal Alaska due to
   clear climatic causes. Already, western Alaska, previously extending to
   tree limit, has become the optimum climate region for the species. With
   modest additional warming widespread tree death will be unavoidable on
   warmer lowland interior sites, where persistence of white spruce is
   unlikely. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research was performed for the purpose of analysing the
   relationships between large-scale meteorological information, in
   particular the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the Sea
   Surface Temperature (SST), and the timing and magnitude of the
   Cupressaceae pollen season in the Pistoia district of Central Italy. The
   results demonstrated that in specific periods of the year, the NAO
   index, by partially determining the distribution of the main
   meteorological variables over the study area, is negatively correlated
   with the start and the end, as well as the peak day of pollen
   concentration. Pollen data were also correlated with the SST of the
   North Atlantic Ocean east of the Azores for the September-December
   period of the previous year, which is significant for exploring
   possibilities in terms of predicting the timing and magnitude of the
   cypress pollen season. The analysis of such meteorological variables and
   indices could be used to improve the existing forecasting systems of the
   phenology of the cypress pollen season. Moreover, the possibility of
   using meteorological information freely available on internet could cut
   costs and reduce spatial and temporal representativeness limitations
   relating to weather monitoring in loco.

AB In the absence of proteins, synthetic lipid membranes can display
   quantized conduction events for ions that are virtually
   indistinguishable from those of protein channels. The phenomenological
   similarities between typical conductances are striking: they are of
   equal order and show similar lifetime distributions and current
   histograms. They can include conduction bursts, flickering, and
   multistep conductance. Lipid channels can be gated by voltage and
   blocked by drugs. They respond to changes in lateral membrane tension
   and temperature. Thus, they behave like voltage-gated,
   temperature-gated, and mechano-sensitive protein channels, or like
   receptors.
   The similarity between lipid and protein channels poses an important
   problem for the interpretation of protein channel data. For example, the
   Hodgkin-Huxley theory for nerve pulse conduction requires a selective
   mechanism for the conduction of sodium and potassium ions. To this end,
   the lipid membrane must act both as a capacitor and as an insulator.
   Nonselective ion conductance by mechanisms other than the gated protein
   channels challenges the proposed mechanism for pulse propagation.
   Nevertheless, textbooks rarely describe the properties of the lipid
   membrane surrounding the proteins in their discussions of membrane
   models.
   These similarities lead to important questions: Do these similarities in
   lipid and protein channels result from a common mechanism, or are these
   similarities fortuitous? What distinguishes protein channels from lipid
   channels, if anything?
   In this Account, we document experimental and theoretical findings that
   show the similarity between lipid and protein channels. We discuss
   important cases where protein channel function strongly correlates with
   the properties of the lipid. Based on statistical thermodynamics
   simulations, we discuss how such correlations could come about. We
   suggest that proteins on act as catalysts for lipid channel formation
   and that this hypothesis can explain some of the unexplained
   correlations between protein and lipid membrane function.

AB Fragilariopsis kerguelensis is one of the most abundant diatoms in the
   sediments of the Southern Ocean. Its morphometric features have been
   proposed as proxies, based on links with, for example, iron
   availability, sea surface temperature and glacial/interglacial
   conditions. We investigated morphometric changes in F. kerguelensis
   valves in a well-studied sediment core record, focusing on transition
   periods between glacials and interglacials. By applying a
   high-throughput diatom imaging and morphometry workflow, we found two
   clearly distinct morphotypes which were differentiated by their
   rectangularity. One of them occurred preferentially in glacial samples,
   whilst the other persisted throughout. This indicates that their
   relative abundances depend on environmental conditions and thereby
   points to the possibility that paleo-proxies based on F. kerguelensis
   valve morphometric features might in the future benefit from
   differentiating these two morphotypes. As an initial exploration of this
   idea, we show that the abundance ratio of both morphotypes correlates
   well with paleotemperatures which had been reconstructed using
   independent data from the same core. Distinguishing between the two
   morphotypes only became possible by image analysis for precisely
   measuring diatom valve outlines and area, highlighting the potential of
   such methods for diatom analyses.

AB Temperatures in Oceania have risen by 0.5-1 degrees C over the past 100
   years, resulting in significant retreat of New Zealand's glaciers as an
   example. To better understand natural and anthropogenic contributions to
   this warming process, the observed climatic change must be placed in a
   longer-term palaeotemperature context. Of interest is the Medieval
   Climate Anomaly (MCA, 1000-1200 AD), a recognized period of natural
   pre-industrial climate change, associated with marked temperature and
   hydroclimatic variability that is best known from the Northern
   Hemisphere. Temperature reconstructions for Oceania were traditionally
   based on two classical tree ring series. Here, we enlarge the Oceania
   reference data set with another 13 published temperature reconstructions
   from SE Australia, New Zealand, and West Papua. These are based on a
   variety of proxy types and help to geographically and methodologically
   augment the regional palaeoclimate database. The proxy series have been
   thoroughly compared and the MCA trends palaeoclimatologically mapped.
   Ten out of the 15 sites show a relatively warm MCA, compared to the last
   1500 years, with warming generally occurring in the envelope period
   900-1500 AD. In some sites of SE Australia and at the west coast of New
   Zealand's South Island, warming appears to be delayed by 200-300 years.
   The end of the medieval warming at around 1500 AD occurred about two
   centuries later than on most other continents, suggesting a possible
   interhemispheric climate lag mechanism possibly involving deep-water
   circulation. Likely drivers for the medieval warming in Oceania are
   atmosphericocean cycles such as the Southern Annular Mode and El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation, in combination with solar activity changes.
   MCA palaeotemperature data are still lacking for large parts of Oceania,
   namely the arid and tropical parts of Australia, Micronesia, central and
   northern Polynesia, as well as central and eastern Melanesia,
   highlighting the need for future research.

AB Variation in the number of abdominal vs. caudal vertebrae is an
   important source of morphological diversification of fish. It is not
   clear, however, whether abdominal and caudal regions evolve
   independently. Regressions of offspring on parents demonstrated
   substantial additive genetic variation within populations, i.e.
   heritability, in both abdominal and caudal vertebral numbers of the
   medaka (Oryzias latipes). However, the heritability of caudal vertebrae
   tended to be smaller than that of abdominal vertebrae in some
   estimations, suggesting that abdominal and caudal regions are controlled
   by separate developmental modules. Furthermore, genetic correlation
   between abdominal and caudal vertebral numbers, estimated using full-sib
   family means, was negative but weak, supporting independent evolution.
   In addition, substantial genetic differentiation among populations was
   demonstrated in abdominal vertebral numbers, but not in caudal numbers.
   These results support our view that Jordan's rule, a geographical
   tendency for fish from higher latitudes to have more vertebrae, in this
   fish reflects local adaptations of abdominal vertebral numbers. In
   contrast, the low heritability of caudal vertebrae may reflect the
   intrinsic invariability of genes associated with a change in caudal
   vertebral numbers. This genetic constraint may have restricted
   morphological diversification of not only the medaka, but also the Order
   Beloniformes as a whole. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London,

AB Recent climate warming is thought to affect the migratory behavior and
   geographical range shifts of Pipistrellus nathusii. This bat of the
   European temperate woodland zone is known to migrate up to 1900 km
   between its breeding and wintering areas where it uses overground roosts
   for hibernation. New wintering areas of the species have been recorded
   lately mainly in the cities of Central Europe, largely extending its
   winter distribution to the north-east. The growing detection of the
   winter occurrence of P. nathusii has coincided with an increase in mean
   winter temperatures and urban warming. Our analysis shows that a winter
   isotherm of -25 degrees C acts as a border for the winter occurrence of
   P. nathusii, and the species uses urban areas, most likely benefiting
   from the effect of urban heat islands. Accordingly, the island-like
   pattern of P. nathusii's regular wintering habitats distribution in
   Central Europe seems to reflect the thermal and structural diversity of
   the environment. The use of diverse anthropogenic roosts suggests that
   the species is well-adapted to urban habitats, thus demonstrating its
   ecological plasticity.

AB A mild bleaching event (9.2% prevalence) at Palmyra Atoll occurred in
   response to the 2009 ENSO, when mean water temperature reached 29.8-30.1
   degrees C. Prevalence among both abundant and sparse taxa varied with no
   clear pattern in susceptibility relating to coral morphology. Seven
   taxon-specific models showed that turbidity exacerbated while prior
   exposure to higher background temperatures alleviated bleaching, with
   these predictors explaining an average 16.3% and 11.5% variation in
   prevalence patterns, respectively. Positive associations occurred
   between bleaching prevalence and both immediate temperature during the
   bleaching event (average 8.4% variation explained) and increased sand
   cover (average 3.7%). Despite these associations, mean unexplained
   variation in prevalence equalled 59%. Lower bleaching prevalence in
   areas experiencing higher background temperatures suggests acclimation
   to temperature stress among several coral genera, while WWII
   modifications may still be impacting the reefs via shoreline sediment
   re-distribution and increased turbidity, exacerbating coral bleaching
   susceptibility during periods of high temperature stress. (C) 2010

   46(1): 111-122. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the
   Argentine short-finned squid, Illex argentinus, abundances and
   relationships between the squid abundance and environmental variables in
   the Southwest Atlantic were analyzed using a geographical information
   system and statistical methods. The abundances of squid were estimated
   by standardizing commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the
   Taiwanese squid fishery during 1986-2003. Illex argentinus has a clear
   general annual migration pattern, which consistently occurred in
   different years. The monthly distribution patterns of sea surface
   temperature (SST) corresponded to the current systems in the Southwest
   Atlantic. Local squid abundances showed a negative correlation with SSTs
   during Mar.-Aug., although it was difficult to determine if this
   reflected any causal link. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and SSTs
   on the southern and northern portions of the Patagonian Shelf were
   analyzed to investigate the teleconnection between them and a lag-effect
   on squid abundances. SSTs on both the southern and northern portions of
   the Patagonian shelf showed a link with the SOI, at respective lag times
   of 2 and 3 yr. No significant correlation was found between the SOI and
   squid abundances, or between SSTs of the southern portion of the
   Patagonian Shelf and squid abundances within the calculated range of the
   time lag (10 yr), while SSTs of the northern portion of the shelf were
   negatively correlated with squid abundances with a lag of 1 yr. Cold
   events on the northern portion of the Patagonian Shelf in the previous
   year could be a key factor for the high squid abundance in the current
   year. Whether or not there are high or low abundances, the distribution
   patterns of squid on the Patagonian Shelf are locally influenced by the
   presence of thermal fronts, which are themselves dependent upon the
   distribution and strength of the cold currents.

   investigated the cytological processes involved in formation and
   development of male and female gametes as well as their interactions in
   fertilization, using an indica/japonica hybrid in comparison with an
   indica/indica hybrid. It was found that more than 50% of the microspores
   generated in the indica/japonica hybrid could not develop into
   functional pollen. The abortion rate of microspores in the
   indica/japonica hybrid was much higher than that in the indica/indica
   hybrid. Abortive embryo sacs made up roughly 70% of the embryo sacs
   examined in the indica/japonica hybrid, which was also much higher than
   that detected in the indica/indica hybrid. Moreover, the amount of
   pollen adherence on stigmas of the indica variety upon hand-pollination
   with pollen from the japonica variety was much lower than the
   indica/indica pollination, and the number of pollen adhered on the
   stigmas by natural self-pollination was much greater in the
   indica/indica hybrid than in the indica/japonica hybrid. The
   indica/japonica hybrid also encountered difficulties in pollen tube
   growth after pollination, and the fertilization rate of the
   indica/japonica hybrid was much lower than that of the indica/indica
   hybrid. These results clearly illustrate the complexity of the
   mechanisms underlying inter-subspecific hybrid sterility in rice
   involving both pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolation mechanisms.

AB Warmer climates are already contributing to significant decreases in
   wheat (Triticum spp.) yields worldwide, highlighting the need for more
   adapted germplasm. Although many studies have addressed the effects of
   warmer climates on grain physiology and photosynthesis, only a few have
   considered temperature effects on other key yield-related traits such as
   the sensitivity of transpiration rate (TR) to vapour pressure deficit
   (VPD) - a function of air temperature and relative humidity. In wheat,
   no reports are available to document such influences. More importantly,
   the relative contributions of heat-stress night and day conditions on
   such sensitivity and the plant's evaporative surface remain to be
   investigated. The objective of this study was to assess the response of
   these two physiological processes to long-term (i.e. 3 weeks) exposures
   to six warming scenarios, consisting of a combination of three target
   growth-period VPD (2, 2.7 and 4 kPa), and two night temperature (20 and
   30 degrees C) regimes among 11 diverse bread and durum wheat lines
   having different origins. The study revealed (i) a large genetic
   variability in those responses; (ii) non-linear interactions between the
   effects of day and night conditions; and (iii) compensation mechanisms
   between leaf areas and transpiration sensitivities to VPD together with
   differential acclimation strategies of these sensitivities with respect
   to increasingly warmer scenarios. These findings open the way to
   implementing breeding strategies that can improve wheat yields under
   different warming scenarios.

AB Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth, maintenance
   and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection.
   Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences
   of within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates - how
   metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve.
   Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective,
   relying primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but
   ultimately more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of
   phenotypic variation is through use of the breeder's equation, because
   variation in metabolic rate is likely to be a consequence of underlying
   microevolutionary processes. Here we show that metabolic rates are often
   significantly heritable, and are therefore free to evolve under
   selection. We note, however, that 'metabolic rate' is not a single
   trait: in addition to the obvious differences between metabolic levels
   (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate changes
   through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and is
   therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize
   three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative
   genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative
   power. We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative
   genetics framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness,
   rather than proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic
   covariances between metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii)
   estimating genetic covariances between metabolic rates and other traits.
   A quantitative genetics framework provides the means for quantifying the
   evolutionary potential of metabolic rate and why variance in metabolic
   rates within populations might be maintained.

AB The diversity of the prokaryotes that have been studied, combined with
   the many different effects of low temperature, has led to an extensive
   literature concerning cold stress responses in mesophilic bacteria. The
   aim of this review is to discuss the effects of cold on the behavior of
   bacteria. The following three responses will be described: (i)
   biochemical modifications consisting first of membrane fatty acid
   desaturation and second of the synthesis of cold stress proteins. (ii)
   physiological responses of the cells to permit growth at low
   temperatures above 0 degrees C and cryotolerance at lower temperatures,
   and (iii) control of the cold shock response at a transcriptional and/or
   translational level. This paper reviews knowledge, most of which has
   been acquired in the last 10 years, in the field of cold stress
   responses. It is hoped that these data will help to focus attention on
   the metabolic responses associated with environmental disturbance. (C)

AB Predicting the effects of seasonality and climate change on the
   emergence and spread of infectious disease remains difficult, in part
   because of poorly understood connections between warming and the
   mechanisms driving disease. Trait-based mechanistic models combined with
   thermal performance curves arising from the metabolic theory of ecology
   (MTE) have been highlighted as a promising approach going forward;
   however, this framework has not been tested under controlled
   experimental conditions that isolate the role of gradual temporal
   warming on disease dynamics and emergence. Here, we provide experimental
   evidence that a slowly warming host-parasite system can be pushed
   through a critical transition into an epidemic state. We then show that
   a trait-based mechanistic model with MTE functional forms can predict
   the critical temperature for disease emergence, subsequent disease
   dynamics through time and final infection prevalence in an
   experimentally warmed system ofDaphniaand a microsporidian parasite. Our
   results serve as a proof of principle that trait-based mechanistic
   models using MTE subfunctions can predict warming-induced disease
   emergence in data-rich systems-a critical step towards generalizing the
   approach to other systems.

AB Artemisia ordosica Krasch. (Asteraceae) is the dominant psammophytic
   shrub species on the Ordos Plateau of northern China and is used for
   revegetation of semi-arid areas. Experiments were conducted to determine
   the effects of light intensity, constant temperature, alternating
   temperatures, and water potential on germination to determine why
   air-dispersed achenes fail to germinate well in the field. Achenes
   germinated within a wide alternating temperature window, except under
   the 5:15 degrees C (night:day) temperature regime in darkness. Final
   percent germination (FPG) was higher in darkness than in light at
   alternating temperature regimes, except under the 20:30 degrees C
   (night:day) temperature regime. Achenes subjected to a range of constant
   temperatures in the dark had high FPG over 76.8% except at 30 degrees C
   (8%). Photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) of 100 and 400 mu mol
   center dot m(-2 center dot)s(-1) significantly lowered FPG under a 10:20
   degrees C (night:day) regime, while at 0-25 mu molm center dot(2)center
   dot s(-1) PPFD, the FPG was over 92%. Few achenes germinated at -1.4
   MPa. The most suitable temperature for germination of achenes placed
   under water stress was 20 degrees C. The best timing for air dispersal
   is mid-May, so seeds would become covered with sand at a time when
   temperature and soil moisture conditions were optimal for germination.

AB A two-species population dynamics model was constructed for Japanese
   sardine Sardinops melanostictus and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus off
   the Pacific coast of Japan. Japanese sardine and chub mackerel have
   exhibited dramatic changes in stock abundance. The simulation captures
   these fluctuations clearly for the period 1976-2000 using this model.
   This population dynamics model has three sub-models: Stock,
   RecruitmentOfSardine and RecruitmentOfChubMackerel. The sub-model Stock
   is an age-structured model which calculates the natural mortality,
   catch, and spawning biomass of sardine and chub mackerel, respectively.
   The sub-model RecruitmentOfSardine is comprised of two sub-models: a
   spawning model Spawning and a spatial model Ocean of the early life
   stages. The sub-model RecruitmentOfChubMackerel is a recruitment model
   which receives the spawning biomass of chub mackerel and the stock
   biomass of sardine from the sub-model Stock and calculates the
   recruitment number of chub mackerel by an extended Ricker
   spawner-recruit curve which incorporates the water temperature of the
   spawning area and the stock biomass of sardine. The initial simulations
   were carried out using data of the age-specific stock number (number of
   individuals) and the data of the individual age-specific weight of
   sardine and chub mackerel in 1976. As the output data of 1977-2000,
   yearly egg data of sardine, recruitment data of chub mackerel, stock
   data and catch data were obtained. In this work, using the two-species
   population dynamics model, we investigated the influence of the fishery
   and the water temperature on the biomass of the two fishes. Our
   simulation revealed that the simulated chub mackerel stock increased
   again after 1995 in the absence of catch, however, the sardine stock
   decreased after the late-1980s even in the absence of catch. In the case
   of lower water temperature, the simulated sardine stock increased and
   the simulated chub mackerel stock decreased. It was expected that the
   fluctuations of two fishes population were re-synchronized after a
   certain period of time by effects of the water temperature. Our
   simulation indicated that the water temperature could influence the
   different stock fluctuations of sardine and chub mackerel in the case
   that the initial status of these fishes were very different. (C) 2008

AB It is widely held both in the physiological literature, and more
   generally, that the average characteristics of species within an
   assemblage differ among sites. Such generalizations should be based on
   investigations of whole assemblages at sites, but this is rarely done.
   Here, such a study is undertaken for virtually the full assemblage of
   springtails found at sub-Antarctic Marion Island, by investigating
   supercooling points (SCPs) of 12 of the 16 species that occur there.
   Assemblage level variation tends to be less than that documented for
   assemblages across northern hemisphere sites but similar to that found
   at some Antarctic locations. Across this set of species, the mean SCPs
   of the indigenous species (mean +/- SE = -17.2 +/- 0.4 degrees C) do not
   differ significantly from that of the invasive species (-16.3 +/- 0.7
   degrees C). Overall, the introduction of several species to the island
   does not appear to have led to functional homogenization (for this
   trait). By combining the assemblage-level SCP data with information on
   the abundances of the species in each of four major habitats, it is also
   shown that severe but uncommon low temperature events could
   substantially alter species relative abundances. By resetting assemblage
   trajectories, such events could play an important role in the
   terrestrial system at the island.

AB The aim of this study was to describe morphological variations of
   Opuntia jaliscana in 5 wild populations in the state of Jalisco
   (Mexico). Populations were selected along an environmental aridity
   gradient, and 61 vegetative and reproductive characters from 25
   individuals were measured per population. Quantitative characters were
   analyzed independently by a one-way ANOVA test using the site as
   variation factor. Subsequently, a discriminant analysis was performed.
   The discriminant analysis results showed that the 46% of the total
   variation was explained by the first four discriminant functions. The
   analysis of overall membership between populations indicated that
   individuals were correctly classified in 87% of cases. Pearson linear
   correlation between the most significant variables and the aridity
   index, showed a positive relationship to cladode thickness and diameter
   of the trunk. The population from Tierra Blanca shows an outlier
   behavior because of variation in cladode thickness and fruit size, which
   might be related to plasticity of individuals to have a greater
   availability of water, while in Los Vallejo the separation might be due
   to selection by management and use. The remaining populations exhibited
   some morphological variability without separation.

AB The possibility of accurately predicting timing and extent of seedling
   emergence from natural seed soil banks has long been an objective of
   both ecologist and agriculturalist. However, as dormancy is a common
   attribute of many wild seed populations, we should first be able to
   predict dormancy changes if we intend to predict seedling emergence in
   the field. In this paper, we discuss the most relevant environmental
   factors affecting seed dormancy of natural seed soil banks, and present
   a conceptual framework as an attempt to understand how these factors
   affect seed-bank dormancy level. Based on this conceptual framework we
   show approaches that can be used to establish quantitative functional
   relationship between environmental factors regulating dormancy and
   changes in the seed-bank dormancy status. Finally, we briefly explain
   how we can utilize population-based threshold models as a framework to
   characterize and quantify changes in seed sensitivity to environmental
   factors as a consequence of dormancy loss and/or induction.

AB Biscogniauxia mediterranea is a xylariaceous ascomycete responsible for
   'charcoal disease', the most frequent disease of cork oak in the
   Mediterranean basin. However, little is known regarding this fungus in
   North Africa. This is the first report on the morphological and genetic
   diversity of B. mediterranea populations in Tunisia. A total of
   forty-eight isolates from cork oak trees, corresponding to three
   different sites and three tree parts, were identified as B. mediterranea
   based on morphological and molecular diagnosis. Variability among the
   isolates was evaluated using morphological traits and
   microsatellite-primed PCR (MSP-PCR). B. mediterranea isolates showed
   high variability in culture, specifically in colony color. A high level
   of genetic diversity within populations and within tree parts was
   detected (H = 0.417, 1 = 0.605, and H = 0.415, 1=0.601 respectively).
   Significant genetic differentiation among populations (G(ST) = 0.116 and
   Phi(ST) = 0.137; p < 0.001) was determined. However, a low genetic
   differentiation among tree parts (G(ST) = 0.066 and (1) Phi(ST) = 0.018:
   p = 0.07) was observed. Principal coordinate analysis showed that
   genetic divergence was partially related to the geographical origin.
   Cluster analysis based on morphological traits showed that the grouping
   of the isolates occurs independently of the geographic location and the
   tree part. The effective number of alleles (Ne), the Nei's gene
   diversity index (H), the Shannon's information index (I), the colony
   color and the presence of exudates were significantly correlated with
   the altitude and the rainfall. The number of alleles (Na), the
   percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL), the texture and the density of the
   mycelium were significantly correlated with the temperature. These
   results provide a deeper understanding of population genetics of B.
   mediterranea and its adaptation to environmental conditions which could
   help to develop control strategies against charcoal canker disease. (C)

AB Actomyosin contractility originating from interactions between F-actin
   and myosin facilitates various structural reorganizations of the actin
   cytoskeleton. Cross-linked actomyosin networks show a tendency to
   contract to single or multiple foci, which has been investigated
   extensively in numerous studies. Recently, it was suggested that
   suppression of F-actin buckling via an increase in bending rigidity
   significantly reduces network contraction. In this study, we demonstrate
   that networks may show the largest contraction at intermediate bending
   rigidity, not at the lowest rigidity, if filaments are severed by
   buckling arising from myosin activity as demonstrated in recent
   experiments; if filaments are very flexible, frequent severing events
   can severely deteriorate network connectivity, leading to the formation
   of multiple small foci and low network contraction. By contrast, if
   filaments are too stiff, the networks exhibit minimal contraction due to
   the inhibition of filament buckling. This study reveals that
   buckling-induced filament severing can modulate the contraction of
   active cytoskeletal networks, which has been neglected to date.

AB An inevitable consequence of global climate change is that altered
   patterns of temperature and precipitation threaten agriculture in marry
   tropical regions, requiring strategies of human adaptation. Moreover,
   the process of management intensification in agriculture has increased
   and may exacerbate vulnerability to climate extremes. Although many
   solutions have been presented, the role of simple agroecological and
   agroforestry management has been largely ignored. Some recent literature
   has shown how sustainable management may improve agroecological
   resistance to extreme climate events. We comment specifically on a
   prevalent form of agriculture throughout Latin America, the coffee
   agroforestry system. Results from the coffee literature have shown that
   shade management in coffee systems may mitigate the effects of extreme
   temperature and precipitation, thereby reducing the ecological and
   economic vulnerability of many rural farmers. We conclude that more
   traditional forms of agriculture can offer greater potential for
   adapting to changing conditions than do current intensive systems.

   or 20 min (AWU(20)) of AWU. All the warm-up protocols consisted of
   pedaling at a constant pace of 60 rpm against 50% of the maximal aerobic

   index were measured. The RPE values were not affected by the time-of-day
   after both AWU and the Wingate test. The PP and MP during the Wingate

AB If we are to ensure the persistence of species in an increasingly warm
   world, of interest is the identification of drivers that affect the
   ability of an organism to resist thermal stress. Underpinning any
   organism's capacity for resistance is a complex interplay between
   biological and physical factors occurring over multiple scales. Tropical
   coral reefs are a unique system, in that their function is dependent
   upon the maintenance of a coral-algal symbiosis that is directly
   disrupted by increases in water temperature. A number of physical
   factors have been identified as affecting the biological responses of
   the coral organism under broadscale thermal anomalies. One such factor
   is water flow, which is capable of modulating both organismal metabolic
   functioning and thermal environments. Understanding the physiological
   and hydrodynamic drivers of organism response to thermal stress improves
   predictive capabilities and informs targeted management responses,
   thereby increasing the resilience of reefs into the future.

AB Sugar and organic acid contents as well as sugar-to-acid ratio of fruit
   are important factors affecting fruit quality and processing. In this
   study, we compared sugar and organic acid contents of Vaccinium
   uliginosum (bog bilberry) fruit harvested from 100 plants across 10 wild
   populations growing in the Changbai Mountains of China. Correlation of
   sugar and acid contents with the spatial distribution of these
   populations was accessed. Germplasm with high sugar and low acid with
   potential for use in future breeding was also identified. Results showed
   that sugar and organic acid contents varied among different V.
   uliginosum populations in the Changbai Mountains. Fructose (18.60-38.54
   mg.g(-1)) and glucose (15.77-35.08 mg.g(-1)) were the main sugars,
   whereas quinic (16.06-20.97 mg.g(-1)), citric (10.39-14.96 mg.g(-1)),
   and malic (4.28-7.47 mg.g(-1)) acids were the main organic acids in V.
   uliginosum. The first population collected in the Dongfanghong forest
   farm (lat. 42 degrees 00' N, long. 128 degrees 03' E) showed the highest
   average sugar content and sugar-to-acid ratio among the sampled
   populations. Moreover, total sugar content and sugar-to-acid ratio of
   Sample 7-Population 1, which is located at Manjiang forest farm (lat. 41
   degrees 09'N, long. 127 degrees 05'E) was much higher than the other 99
   samples, making this sample representative of important germplasm for
   breeding. Altitude and latitude were important environmental factors
   affecting sugar and organic acid contents. Fructose, glucose, and total
   sugar contents were positively correlated with altitude and negatively
   correlated with latitude. Oxalic acid content and sugar-to-acid ratio
   were positively correlated with altitude, and there was no significant
   correlation between organic acid contents and latitude.

AB In southwestern Japan, late sowing of soybean is an option that may
   avoid the damage caused by excessive soil moisture during the rainy
   season. We investigated the adaptability to late sowing using 17
   genotypes from 5 countries. The seeds were sown on 15 - 20 July, and 2 -
   5 August in the normal and late sowing seasons, respectively, in an
   upland field in Karatsu, southwestern Japan in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Late
   sowing reduced the seed yield by 28.1% and 21.8% on average in the 2009
   and 2011 experiments, respectively, whereas it had almost no effect in
   2010, in which the temperature was high from sowing to flowering. Seed
   yield was not improved by increasing the growth period with a longer
   juvenile growth stage in the genotypes that originated in tropical
   areas. In the late sowing, seed yield was significantly correlated with
   the reproductive period from flowering to maturity and pod number, but
   not with the vegetative period from sowing to the end of leaf expansion
   or seed size. Soybean cultivars Caviness (USA), Parana and IAS-5
   (Brazil), and Akisengoku and Akiyoshi (Japan) showed higher productivity
   in both types of sowing season, and their seed yields were less reduced
   by late sowing. These genotypes generally have larger pod number and
   seed number or longer seed filling periods, but they have medium-size
   seeds. Our results indicate that the seed yield in late sowing could be
   improved by the selection of adaptive genotypes that have larger seed
   number and / or longer seed filling periods.

   F-actin at appropriate concentrations phase separate to form tactoidal
   droplets. These tactoids are the result of the minimization of their

   poles. The tactoids are shown to form through two distinct mechanisms:
   nucleation and growth and spinodal decomposition. Both mechanisms
   produce tactoids with final domain sizes that are of the same order of
   magnitude. Additionally, analysis of the system shows several features
   of metastability. The solution can exist in a variety of steady states
   near equilibrium and can be easily perturbed, settling in one prescribed
   by the path followed in phase space.

AB We studied the efficiency of thermoregulation in four high elevation
   Liolaemus species in the Andes of Salta, Argentina; Liolaemus
   irregularis, Liolaemus multicolor, Liolaemus albiceps and Liolaemus
   yanalcu. One of the species, L irregularis, shows a broad distribution
   being in allopatry in some localities and in sympatry with L albiceps, L
   multicolor and L yanalcu at different sites. Together with this
   variation in assemblages, the degree of phylogenetic relatedness is
   different with L irregularis being most closely related to L albiceps
   than to the other two species (L multicolor and L yanalcu). We measured
   body (T-b), microenvironmental (T-a, T-s) and operative temperatures
   (T-e) in the field, and preferred body temperature (T-pref) in
   laboratory for each one of the species of assemblages. Three out of the
   four species showed a high thermoregulatory efficiency except for L.
   yanalcu, a moderate thermoregulator. The species studied here show high
   T-b in the field compared to most of the recorded Liolaemus species.
   However, the T-pref values were similar to other Liolaemus species. No
   evidence of thermal niche segregation between species in sympatry was
   observed. Our results suggest that the species studied here, despite
   living at high elevation and harsh climatic conditions are able to
   behaviorally or physiologically thermoregulate to achieve T(b)s close to
   their T-pref, probably because of low predation risk and perhaps low
   levels of competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Actin networks are an integral part of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic
   cells and play an essential role in determining cellular shape and
   movement. Understanding the underlying mechanism of actin network
   assembly is of fundamental importance. We developed in this work a
   minimal motility model and performed stochastic simulations to study
   mechanical regulation of the growth dynamics of lamellipodia-like
   branched actin networks, characterized by various force velocity
   relations. In such networks, the treadmilling process leads to a
   concentration gradient of G-actin, and thus G-actin transport is
   essential to effective actin network assembly. We first explore how
   capping protein modulates force velocity relations and then discuss how
   actin transport due to diffusion and facilitated transport such as
   advective flow tunes the growth dynamics of the branched actin network.
   Our work demonstrates the important role of molecular transport in
   determining the adaptive response of the actin network to an external
   force.

AB The ontogeny of locomotor activity rhythm in the common marmoset was
   studied in three animals, observed during infant and juvenile stages,
   and in adult age. Animals were kept with their families in outdoor cages
   under natural temperature, humidity and light cycles. Data were
   collected from sunrise to sunset, three consecutive days a week, at 5
   min intervals randomly distributed in the clock hours, and were recorded
   as the total of arbitrary cage sections traveled by the animal each
   interval. Animal 3 was observed continuously one day a week in order to
   detect less than 2 h period harmonic components. Animals' weekly data
   series were analyzed by Fourier analysis and Siegel's test to detect
   significant harmonic components. Results showed a main 24 h period
   component for all records and a secondary 8 h period component in at
   least 34% of animal's week data series. The power content of the 24 h
   component showed an increase with age, reaching some stability near the
   16th week of life suggesting that this component is mature at the end of
   the animal's infant stage. However, for the 8 h component an oscillating
   pattern was observed following the environmental annual temperature
   cycle; this may indicate a seasonal modulation of daily locomotor
   activity profiles.

AB Species' tolerance limits determine their capacity to tolerate climatic
   extremes and limit their potential distributions. Interspecific
   variation in thermal tolerances is often proposed to indicate climatic
   vulnerability and is, therefore, the subject of many recent meta-studies
   on differential capacities of species from climatically different
   habitats to deal with climate change. Most studies on thermal tolerances
   do not acclimate animals or use inconsistent, and insufficient,
   acclimation times, limiting our knowledge of the shape, duration and
   extent of acclimation responses. Consequently patterns in thermal
   tolerances observed in meta-analyses, based on data from the literature
   are based on inconsistent, partial acclimation and true trends may be
   obscured. In this study we describe time-course of complete acclimation
   of critical thermal minima in the tropical ectotherm Carlia longipes and
   compare it to the average acclimation response of other reptiles,
   estimated from published data, to assess how much acclimation time may
   contribute to observed differences in thermal limits. Carlia longipes
   decreased their lower critical thermal limits by 2.4 degrees C and
   completed 95% of acclimation in 17 weeks. Wild populations did not
   mirror this acclimation process over the winter. Other reptiles appear
   to decrease cold tolerance more quickly (95% in 7 weeks) and to a
   greater extent, with an estimated average acclimation response of 6.1
   degrees C. However, without data on tolerances after longer acclimation
   times available, our capacity to estimate final acclimation state is
   very limited. Based on the subset of data available for meta-analysis,
   much of the variation in cold tolerance observed in the literature can
   be attributed to acclimation time. Our results indicate that (i)
   acclimation responses can be slow and substantial, even in tropical
   species, and (ii) interspecific differences in acclimation speed and
   extent may obscure trends assessed in some meta-studies. Cold tolerances
   of wild animals are representative of cumulative responses to recent
   environments, while lengthy acclimation is necessary for controlled
   comparisons of physiological tolerances. Measures of inconsistent,
   intermediate acclimation states, as reported by many studies, represent
   neither the realised nor the potential tolerance in that population, are
   very likely underestimates of species' physiological capacities and may
   consequently be of limited value.

AB A species distribution model has been developed for one of the most
   well-studied varanid lizards - Varanus griseus caspius. The model was
   developed based on several hundred documented localities of the lizard
   and a number of abiotic variables using statistical and GIS-based
   approaches. The results of evaluation using the model demonstrated the
   appropriate spatial accuracy of the model. What is more important, the
   analysis of key variables as revealed by the model and its comparison to
   the published information on the biology of the Desert Monitor
   demonstrated the value of the species distribution model as a tool for
   providing additional and reliable information on certain aspects of
   species biology. Known data on V. griseus confirms the validity of the
   selection of key variables by statistical modeling of living species in
   suitable habitat conditions. The method of Species Distribution Modeling
   may be of use when studying poorly-known species, as it is able to draw
   the researcher's attention to certain environmental factors previously
   unknown or unavailable for direct observation. The map of potential
   distribution of the Desert Monitor and the list of key abiotic variables
   are discussed in detail, emphasizing the impact of temperature and
   moisture on different stages of the lizard's annual cycle. The
   particular impact of some key variables remains questionable. This
   problem may be explained in two ways. First, the species distribution
   model is quite imperfect as it deals with a limited set of variables
   which does not include biotic factors such as food availability; the
   pattern of vegetation; the presence of competing species; the existence
   of natural barriers; and others. Another explanation is more speculative
   and sophisticated as it assumes a lack of knowledge concerning certain
   aspects of the organism's life-cycle and the complex nature of the
   interaction of abiotic factors. However, the value of Species
   Distribution Modeling should not be underestimated, as the modeling
   procedure is unaffected by the "human factor" and the subjectivity of an
   individual researcher.

   The surface pattern in January 2010 indicated that diatoms, haptophytes
   and prasinophytes tended to be the most prominent groups inshore and in
   the southern sector of the bight, whereas Prochlorococcus and
   Synechococcus were more dominant in the north and towards the offshore
   region. At the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), diatoms were dominant in
   the inner bight and in the south, with prasinophytes being the prominent
   flagellates, but this changed to Prochlorococcus and pelagophytes being
   the important groups in the northern sector and outer part of the bight.
   A different pattern was observed at the surface in July 2010, where
   diatoms, haptophytes, prasinophytes and cryptophytes in varying
   proportions comprised most of the community in the inner half of the
   bight, whereas Synechococcus and haptophytes were the main groups in the
   outer sector. A similar pattern occurred at the DCM, except that
   Synechococcus was less prominent and pelagophytes were distributed
   across the bight in both the inshore and offshore zones. Observations
   and relationships between phytoplankton groups and environmental
   parameters indicated that the groups were most closely related to
   temperature, accounting for 24-64% of the deviance. The influence of
   nutrients on phytoplankton was less clear but nitrate and silicate
   seemed to account for some of the patchy distribution patterns.

AB Synopsis In 1967 Daniel Janzen published an influential paper titled
   "Why Mountain Passes Are Higher in the Tropics." Janzen derived a simple
   climatic-physiological model predicting that tropical mountain passes
   would be more effective barriers to organismal dispersal than would
   temperate-zone passes of equivalent altitude. This prediction derived
   from a recognition that the annual variation in ambient temperature at
   any site is relatively low in the tropics. Such low variation within
   sites not only reduces the seasonal overlap in thermal regimes between
   low- and high-altitude sites, but should also select for organisms with
   narrow physiological tolerances to temperature. As a result, Janzen
   predicted that tropical lowland organisms are more likely to encounter a
   Mountain pass as a physiological barrier to dispersal (hence "higher"),
   which should in turn favor smaller distributions and an increase in
   species turnover along altitudinal gradients. This synthetic hypothesis
   has long been at the center of discussions of latitudinal patterns of
   physiological adaptation and of species diversity. Here we review some
   of the key assumptions and predictions of Janzen's hypothesis. We find
   general support for many assumptions and predictions, but call attention
   to several issues that somewhat ameliorate the generality of Janzen's
   classic hypothesis.

AB The relationship between climate and population has long been discussed,
   but rarely has it been quantitatively measured. Hence, the relationship
   remains ambiguous. In the present study, we employ fine-grained
   temperature, aridity threshold, and population data, together with
   logistic models and spatial statistics, to quantitatively explore how
   far climate change affected population growth dynamics in China from
   1000 to 1979. Statistical results confirm that cold climate was
   associated with below average population growth, mediated by regional
   geographic contexts. In addition, cold climate triggered a southward
   shift of populations. In short, the climate-population relationship was
   evident in historical China, and temperature was more influential than
   the aridity threshold in explaining the fluctuation of population size
   and shifts in population distribution. The strong influence of
   temperature change on northward and southward population shifts and the
   weak influence of the change in the aridity threshold on population
   growth dynamics are further discussed. The observed
   temperature-population relationship may give some indication of future
   demographic effects from climate warming.

AB Standard protocols are required for the accurate measurement of global
   soil respiration rates. This research aimed to determine the appropriate
   sampling frequency for pine forest soil respiration rates by quantifying
   the optimal number of measurement chambers and Q(10) values. We used an
   automatic open/closed chamber system with 16 chambers to obtain a high
   level of reliability about soil respiration rates. On average, 57 and 14
   chambers were required to obtain 10% and 20% margins of error at the 95%
   confidence level, while 38 and 9 chambers were required for these 2
   error margins at the 90% confidence level, respectively. Thus, our data
   were in the range of the 20% margin of error at the 95% confidence
   level. ANOVA statistical tests also separated the minimum required
   measurement interval into two groups using Q(10) values based on actual
   measured temperatures: (1) short-term sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days
   and (2) long-term intervals of 7, 14, 20, and 30 days. Our results
   indicate that 3 days is the optimal interval for soil respiration
   measurement. The total amount of soil respiration was estimated as
   9.35tCha(-1)yr(-1) in a pine forest, with soil respiration rates being
   positively related with temperature.

AB Stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) have been declining over much of
   the North Atlantic for the past 30 years, owing to a combination of
   overfishing and adverse changes in their environment. In a previous
   study, environmental effects were introduced as an extra parameter in
   the stock-recruit relationship, where they act as a multiplier,
   independent of the level of spawning-stock biomass (SSB). Using a
   non-parametric pooled analysis of all cod stocks on the European Shelf
   south of 62 degrees N, it is shown here that environmental variability
   (as represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation) only has a
   significant effect on recruitment when the spawning stock is low. This
   has implications for fisheries management strategies, and for rates of
   stock recovery, which will be very dependent on environmental
   conditions. (c) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the

AB Far too little is known about the long-term dynamics of populations for
   almost all macro-organisms. Here, we examined the utility of sedimentary
   DNA techniques to reconstruct the dynamics in the "abundance" of a
   species, which has not been previously defined. We used fish DNA in
   marine sediments and examined whether it could be used to track the past
   dynamics of pelagic fish abundance in marine waters. Quantitative PCR
   for sedimentary DNA was applied on sediment-core samples collected from
   anoxic bottom sediments in Beppu Bay, Japan. The DNA of three dominant
   fish species (anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel) were quantified in
   sediment sequences spanning the last 300 years. Temporal changes in fish
   DNA concentrations are consistent with those of landings in Japan for
   all three species and with those of sardine fish scale concentrations.
   Thus, sedimentary DNA could be used to track decadal-centennial dynamics
   of fish abundance in marine waters.
   Michinobu Kuwae et al. reconstruct the past dynamics of pelagic fish
   abundance in Beppu Bay of Japan, using sedimentary DNA. This study
   demonstrates the utility of sedimentary DNA in investigating the history
   of fish abundance in marine waters.

AB Over the coming decades, our planet will experience a dramatic increase
   in average temperatures and an increase in the variance around those
   temperatures leading to more frequent and harsher heat waves. These
   changes will impact most species and impose strong selection on
   physiological traits. Rapid acclimation is the most direct way for
   organisms to respond to such extreme events, but we currently have
   little understanding of how the capacity to mount such plastic responses
   evolves. Accordingly, there is some urgency to determine how the
   physiological response to high temperatures varies within species, and
   how this variation is driven by the environment. Here, we investigate
   heat-hardening capacity - a rapid physiological response that confers a
   survival advantage under extreme thermal stress - across 13 populations
   of a rain forest lizard, Lampropholis coggeri, from the tropics of
   north-eastern Australia. Our results reveal that heat hardening is
   constrained in these lizards by a hard upper thermal limit for locomotor
   function (approximately 43 degrees C). Further, hardening response shows
   strong geographic variation associated with thermal environment: lizards
   from more predictable and more seasonal thermal environments exhibited
   greater hardening compared with those from more stochastic and less
   seasonal habitats. This finding - that predictability in thermal
   variation influences hardening capacity - aligns closely with
   theoretical expectations. Our results suggest that tropical species may
   harbour adaptive variation in physiological plasticity that they can
   draw from in response to climate change, and this variation is spatially
   structured in locally adapted populations. Our results also suggest
   that, by using climatic data, we can predict which populations contain
   particular adaptive variants; information critical to assisted gene flow
   strategies.

AB Global climates have been changing, sometimes rapidly and dramatically,
   throughout the evolutionary history of amphibians. Therefore, existing
   amphibian species have been derived from those that have survived major
   climatic disturbances. Although recent global climate change has
   resulted in warming in many regions, temperatures in some areas to date
   have not changed measurably, or have even cooled. Declines of some
   amphibian populations have been correlated with climate events, but
   demonstrations of direct causal relationships need further research.
   Data are available indicating some indirect effect of climate change on
   the initiation of breeding activities of some amphibians that occur
   earlier than in previous springs, but the costs and benefits of these
   changes are just beginning to be investigated. Climate may also play an
   indirect role in facilitating epidemics of infectious disease.
   Regardless of the role that climate changes may have played in past and
   current amphibian declines, future shifts in climate, should they prove
   as dramatic as predicted, will certainly pose challenges for surviving
   amphibian populations and for successful recovery efforts of species
   that have suffered declines.

AB Temperature affects the physiological functions of ectotherms. To
   maintain optimal body temperature and ensure physiological performance,
   these organisms can use behavioral adjustments to keep the body
   temperature in their specific temperature range, so-called preferred
   temperature (T-pref). It is therefore crucial to describe and understand
   how T-pref vary within and amongst populations to predict the effects of
   climate change of altitudinal range shifts in organisms. We aimed at
   determining the altitudinal variations in T-pref in three ectothermic
   species (the Pyrenean brook salamander - a semi-aquatic and
   thigmothermic amphibian - the European common lizard and the wall lizard
   - both heliothermic species). Using an experimental approach where
   T-pref were measured along a temperature gradient in laboratory
   conditions, we used a cross-sectional approach to compare the variation
   of T-pref measured in populations sampled along the altitudinal gradient
   in the Pyrenees. We hypothesized a complex and highly variable
   intra-specific response of T pref along geographical dines, with a
   positive relationship between T-pref and altitude (as predicted by the
   countergradient variation), the reverse pattern (referring to the
   adaptation of local optima hypothesis), or no relationship at all. Our
   results corroborated partially the countergradient hypothesis in the
   salamander (middle to high elevation part). At high altitude level,
   individuals may compensate for lower opportunities of favorable
   conditions by choosing a high temperature which maximizes their
   activities. However, populations from low elevation level hence better
   supported the adaptation of local optima hypothesis, such as both lizard
   species, for which T(pref )tended instead to decrease with altitude.
   Lizards from cold climates may be physiologically adapted to low
   temperature, with the ability to reach optimal functioning at lower
   temperature than individuals from low altitude. Our findings suggest
   that predicting future niche models should therefore take into account
   the variability of T-pref, where species might be differently affected
   by global warming.

AB Phenological timing of leaf budburst in plants is important for growth,
   since early budburst timing extends the growth period of the plant. We
   estimated the effect of climate change on the phenological budburst
   timing of four trees throughout four sites in Japan, a region with few
   studies on this topic. The leaf budburst date of plants has advanced or
   been stable during the last five decades in these four Japanese
   localities. This fact is due to the negative relationship between dates
   and temperature using multiple regression models, observed at all sites.
   Climate change has shifted budburst phenology in Japan with the increase
   of spring temperatures. However, precipitation did not show any effect
   on budburst timing. At two budburst dates of three tree species had not
   remarkably changed or delayed through-sites, out the past five decades.
   There were differences between localities at the same latitude. (C) 2007

AB Functional challenges can differ among life-history stages, yet
   performance at one stage may be linked to the outcome of performance at
   others. For example, adult performance, in terms of the location or
   timing of reproduction in response to environmental signals, can set
   conditions that affect the performance of developmental stages. In
   marine invertebrates, however, early performance has been studied
   primarily in the laboratory. I outline an integrative approach to the
   study of field reproductive performance in a marine gastropod that
   undergoes development in intertidal habitats. Embryos within gelatinous
   masses experience high variability in development temperature and
   frequent exposure to thermal stress. In laboratory experiments,
   developmental performance was measured as a function of maximum
   temperature (T-max) experienced during fluctuations that mimicked field
   tidal profiles. Performance curves showed declines that coincided with
   temperature thresholds for heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, a signal
   of cellular stress. Application of laboratory results to field records
   of T-max predicted large variation in the survival of embryos deposited
   on different days. Timing of field reproduction was non-random with
   respect to T-max, suggesting that adults could help to buffer embryos
   from environmental stress. Embryo survival, however, was not predicted
   to benefit from the non-random pattern of adult reproduction. Adults may
   be constrained to respond to information that only weakly predicts
   conditions that embryos will experience. Studies that incorporate
   linkages between life cycle stages in the field may better reveal how
   performance capacities and constraints at one stage can influence
   performance and selection at others.

AB The habitat characteristics of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and the
   ecological relationship between Pacific cod catch and environmental
   parameters in the southern East/Japan Sea were investigated. Pacific cod
   is sexually matured at age of 4-5. The highest catch of Pacific cod off
   the eastern Korean Peninsula occurred in seawater temperature range of
   0-4 degrees C and salinity range of 33.8-34.2 practical salinity unit at
   100 m. The Cross-Correlation Function analysis showed that there was a
   significant negative correlation between Pacific cod catch and February
   seawater temperature at 75 m nearby spawning area with a time lag of 5
   years in Korean waters (r = -0.360, p < 0.05). The annual catch of
   Pacific cod also had a significant correlation (p < 0.05) with
   zooplankton biomass in coastal nursery areas with a time lag, i.e., the
   highest ones, r = 0.432 and r = 0.452, for total zooplankton biomass in
   June of 5 years ago, and for euphausiids abundance in February of 4
   years ago from the period when Pacific cod was caught, respectively.
   Furthermore, total catches of Pacific cod in the southern East/Japan Sea
   (i.e., sum of Korean and Japanese catches) were negatively correlated
   with winter Arctic Oscillation Index, and the highest negative
   correlation (r = -0.364, p < 0.05) was shown with a time lag of 4 years.
   Considering sexual maturation at ages 4-5, such statistical analyses
   imply that biotic and abiotic environmental factors during the early
   life stages of Pacific cod have a significant influence on recruitment
   after 4-5 years of spawning.

AB Rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments were visualized gliding
   over a skeletal heavy meromyosin (HMM)-coated surface. Experiments at
   low filament densities showed that when two filaments collided, their
   paths were affected in a manner that depended on collision angle. Some
   collisions resulted in complete alignment of the filament paths; in
   others, the filaments crossed over one another. Filament crossover or
   alignment was equally probable at similar to 40 degrees contact angle.
   Filaments often underwent significant bending during collision and
   analysis of filament shape indicated an energy requirement of similar to
   13 k(B)T. Experiments were performed over a wide range of HMM surface
   density and actin filament bulk concentration. Actin filament gliding
   speed and path persistence plateaued above a critical HMM surface
   density, and at high (micromolar) actin filament concentrations,
   filament motion became dramatically aligned in a common direction.
   Spatiotemporal features of alignment behavior were determined by
   correlation analysis, supported by simulations. The thermal drift of
   individual filament tracks was suppressed as the population became more
   oriented. Spatial correlation analysis revealed that long-range
   alignment was due to incremental recruitment rather than fusion of
   locally ordered seed domains. The global alignment of filament movement,
   described by an "order parameter," peaked at optimal actin
   concentrations and myosin surface densities, in contrast to previous
   predictions of a critical phase transition. Either hydrodynamic coupling
   or exchange of filaments between the surface bound and adjacent bulk
   phase layers might degrade order at high actin filament concentration,
   and high HMM surface densities might decrease alignment probability
   during collisions. Our results are compatible with generation of
   long-range order from mechanical interaction between individual actin
   filaments. Furthermore, we show that randomly oriented myosin motors
   align relatively short, submicrometer actin filaments into motile
   surface domains that extend over many tens of micrometers and these
   patterns persist for several minutes.

AB All organisms are exposed to daily as well as seasonal variation in
   temperature in nature. However, ectotherms are strongly affected by
   temperature and its variations. Most laboratory studies on effect of
   temperature on life history traits employ constant instead of
   fluctuating temperature regimes, though the latter is more reflective of
   nature. We conducted investigations on the effect of constant,
   fluctuating and alternate temperature regimes on reproductive and
   developmental attributes of a biocontrol agent ladybird, Menochilus
   sexmaculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We used three
   constant, viz. cold, optimum and hot (15 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 35
   degrees C); two fluctuating with variation in mean temperature of the
   day (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C /27 degrees C; 10/14 h) and
   three alternating (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C/27 C, 15
   degrees C/35 degrees C; 24/24 h) temperatures to evaluate their effects
   on these life attributes. Oviposition and percent egg viability along
   with offspring development (immature life stages developmental time and
   developmental rate) and elytral colouration pattern of adults were
   observed. The best response in terms of oviposition and percent egg
   viability was recorded at the constant temperature of 27 degrees C
   followed by the fluctuating regime with a mean temperature of 30.3
   degrees C. The fastest development was found at a constant temperature
   of 35 degrees C, followed by a fluctuating temperature of 35 degrees
   C/27 degrees C for 10/14 h. Among the different temperature cycles, the
   most uncustomary trend of oviposition and percent egg viability was
   recorded on an alternate temperature of 15 degrees C/35 degrees C for
   24/24 h. The constant (27 degrees C) and fluctuating (35 degrees C/27 C
   for 10/14 h) temperatures caused an incremental effect on reproductive
   output and developmental rate. This study demonstrates that M.
   sexmaculatus is able to adjust its physiology according to surrounding
   environmental conditions and acclimatizes well with the
   fluctuating/alternate temperatures suggesting its wide range of
   tolerance. The findings of present work would be helpful in augmenting
   population dynamics of this biocontrol agent to suppress insect pest.

AB BackgroundNest construction is a key element of avian reproductive
   behaviour and the result is often a complex structure that is used for
   incubation of eggs, which represents an extended phenotype. It is known
   that nest construction is a plastic behaviour but the extent to which
   plasticity is observed in a single species with a wide geographical
   distribution is largely unknown. This study sought to better understand
   variation in nest size and composition across a very wide geographical
   area. The hypothesis suggested that location would affect size but not
   composition of nests of the European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula
   hypoleuca).MethodsNests and reproductive data were collected from
   seventeen study sites, spread over 6 degrees of latitude and 3.3 degrees
   of longitude on the island of Great Britain. Dimensions of nests were
   measured before they were deconstructed to determine the masses and
   types materials used in the outer nest and the cup
   lining.ResultsGeographical variation was observed in base thickness of
   nests but not many other dimensions. Nests varied in composition but
   were mainly made of leaf, moss, bark, grass, root and fern. Moss was
   used more to the north and east of the study area compared with more
   leaf mass towards the south and west. The species of leaf and bark used
   in the nests varied between geographical locations. Additionally, the
   use of leaves or bark from a particular tree species did not reflect the
   incidence of the tree species in the immediate territory.ConclusionsThis
   study showed that nest composition was affected by geographical location
   over a wide area. Variation between nests at each location was high and
   so it was concluded that differences in nest composition reflect
   individual selection of materials but evidence is such that it remains
   unclear whether this is deliberate to fulfil a specific role in the
   nest, or simply opportunistic with birds simply picking up materials
   with the appropriate characteristics as they find them outside their
   nestbox.

AB Increases in the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly during the
   second half of the 20th century, have been associated with climate
   warming at the global scale. High latitude areas have been reported to
   be particularly sensitive to Such changes, with significant impacts on
   plant phenology. The objectives of the present study were to (i)
   estimate changes in the flowering dates of 18 spring-flowering
   herbaceous plant species typical of the deciduous forests of eastern
   North America in three areas of eastern Canada (Gatineau-Ottawa,
   Montreal, and Quebec) from 1900 to 2000 and (ii) associate these changes
   with those of annual and spring local temperatures. My results show a
   2-6 days advance in flowering date over 100 years, depending on the
   region considered (corresponding to a similar to 2-3 days advance per 1
   degrees C);these values are somewhat lower than those published in other
   studies, but still support the increasing body of literature on the
   effects of climate warming on plant phenology. Shifts in flowering
   phenology were particularly evident for Montreal, a large metropolitan
   region; this suggests that global climate warming, and its effects on
   plant phenology, may be exacerbated by local conditions, particularly
   those associated with large urban areas. Furthermore, species-specific
   responses to climate warming, as those presented here, might lead to
   significant changes in community composition and ecosystem functions.

   The Great Tit Parus major is one of the most intensively studied birds
   and such studies have contributed greatly to the current understanding
   of the evolution and ecology of natural populations. However, despite
   its wide geographic distribution and high variation in life history
   traits among regions, most ecological studies are concentrated in
   Europe, and there are relatively few studies elsewhere. We studied the
   breeding ecology of a Great Tit population in northern Japan and
   compared their breeding parameters to those described previously for
   European populations. This population was characterized by a long
   breeding season, up to four months from May to as late as the end of
   August (egg-laying to fledging), and a high frequency of multiple
   brooding (60%) including two occasions of third broods. In addition,
   clutch size was large with a mean of over ten, compared to less than
   eight in European populations at the equivalent latitude. The high
   productivity of the studied population may be a consequence of the high
   diversity and abundance of prey items in northern Japan associated with
   past and present climatic characteristics.

AB Tangled lignum ('lignum') is a dioecious, multi-stemmed woody shrub that
   is common in flood-prone areas of inland Australia, including the
   Murray-Darling Basin. It is often leafless during dry periods, but
   maintains vegetative growth by stem layering, and responds rapidly to
   rainfall or flooding by production of shoots, leaves and flowers. This
   study considers the viability of lignum seeds (contained in achenes)
   under various conditions of temperature, light, moisture and storage or
   burial. The seeds are not innately dormant, and germinate within 14 days
   under ideal conditions. From 66 to 86% of fresh and dry-stored seeds
   germinate in fluctuating temperatures (15 degrees C/5 degrees C, 24
   degrees C/10 degrees C, 31 degrees C/15 degrees C), and optimally at 24
   degrees C/10 degrees C, given moisture and light. They also germinate in
   water (56% success), and remain buoyant for 5-25 days. Germination is
   inhibited by constant temperatures of 12 and 24 degrees C (4.0-4.8%
   success) and continuous darkness (6.0-56.0% success), but increases on
   return to light. Seed viability is depressed by 10% after 70-day dry
   storage and by 48% after 92-day burial in soil over winter. In one
   year's (2002) observations of a population on the River Murray
   floodplain near Morgan, South Australia, winter- and spring-seeding
   plants produced viable seeds 14-30 days after anthesis, and although
   rainfall in winter (July) produced a pulse of seedlings, none became
   established. Achenes were shed soon after maturation, but soil samples
   revealed very few germinable seeds. It therefore appears that the seeds
   do not persist for long on the mother plant or in the soil. The
   persistence of lignum in environments prone to erratic droughts and
   floods appears to depend mainly on its capacity to tolerate drought,
   maintain vegetative growth and respond quickly to watering.

AB Spatial distribution patterns of zooplankton biomass in relation to
   local and large-scale hydrographical and biological driving forces were
   studied at Ampere and Senghor, two shallow seamounts in the subtropical
   and tropical NE Atlantic, respectively. The study includes a first
   assessment of the taxonomic composition and an estimation of the
   respiratory carbon demand of the zooplankton community. Zooplankton was
   sampled during three cruises at the seamount and open ocean reference
   sites in May and October 2009 and in December 2010. Zooplankton standing
   stocks and the corresponding respiratory carbon demand were about six
   times higher at Senghor than at Ampere, with mean stocks of 24.7 and
   4.6gm(-2), respectively, in the upper 1000m. Mean respiratory carbon
   demand in the epipelagic zone was calculated as 61.4mgCm(-2)day(-1) for
   Senghor and 9.6mgCm(-2)day(-1) for Ampere. At neither site were
   differences between seamount and open ocean sites significant. However,
   horizontal surveys across Ampere Seamount show clear differences between
   day and night distributions and a reduced biomass above the summit.
   Across Senghor, zooplankton biomass increased from the SW to the NE
   flank, with the highest concentrations in the subsurface layer of the
   chlorophyll maximum and just above a strong oxycline. The zooplankton
   community at Ampere Seamount reflects the oligotrophic character of the
   NE Atlantic subtropical gyre, whereas the nutrient-rich waters of the
   cyclonic tropical gyre at Senghor support a higher biomass. This
   difference in the zooplankton biomass between the two seamounts can be
   attributed to the large-scale hydrographical features governing the
   productivity regimes rather than to regional seamount effects.

AB Species occurring in sympatry have to effectively segregate their niche
   in order to co-exist. In the case of ectotherms in particular, the very
   important parameter of thermal biology has to be taken into account.
   Here we investigated the thermoregulatory effectiveness (E) of two
   endemic Greek lizards (Hellenolacerta graeca and Podarcis
   peloponnesiacus) that live syntopically on a rocky cliff in the
   Peloponnese. We presumed that the two species would select different
   microhabitats, to avoid interspecific competition, and follow a similar
   thermoregulation pattern as they experience the same conditions. We also
   expected that E values for both species would differ depending on the
   season. Overall, we found that the two species had similar E values for
   each season but differentiated partial thermoregulatory attributes.
   Though they both occurred in the same types of microhabitat, H.graeca
   selected higher sites (average 99 cm above ground) than P.
   peloponnesiacus (average 44 cm). Also, the latter achieved higher
   preferred temperatures during summer and winter. Finally, the
   effectiveness of thermoregulation for both species varied
   interseasonally and received its highest values during summer, in
   response to the lowest thermal quality that was observed then. Similar
   studies stress the importance of thermal shifts for ectotherm
   co-existence.

AB During morphogenesis, tissues undergo extensive remodeling to get their
   final shape. Such precise sculpting requires the application of forces
   generated within cells by the cytoskeleton and transmission of these
   forces through adhesion molecules within and between neighboring cells.
   Within individual cells, microtubules together with actomyosin filaments
   and intermediate filaments form the composite cytoskeleton that controls
   cell mechanics during tissue rearrangements. While studies have
   established the importance of actin-based mechanical forces that are
   coupled via intercellular junctions, relatively little is known about
   the contribution of other cytoskeletal components such as microtubules
   to cell mechanics during morphogenesis. In this review the focus is on
   recent findings, highlighting the direct mechanical role of microtubules
   beyond its well-established role in trafficking and signaling during
   tissue formation.

AB Relationships between temporal variations in the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) and grass pollen counts at 13 sites in Europe, ranging
   from Cordoba in the south-west and Turku in the north-east, were studied

   There were a number of significant (P < 0.05) relationships between the
   NAO and start dates of the grass pollen season at the 13
   pollen-monitoring sites. The strongest associations were generally
   recorded near to the Atlantic coast. Several significant correlations
   also existed between winter averages of the NAO and grass pollen season
   severity. Traditional methods for predicting the start or magnitude of
   grass pollen seasons have centred on the use of local meteorological
   observations, but this study has shown the importance of considering

AB <list list-type="1" id="mee312112-list-0001"> The phenology of many
   species has been shown to shift under climate change. However, because
   species respond at different rates, ecological communities may be
   disrupted leading to species extinctions and loss of ecosystem services.
   Hence, there is a need to monitor and understand phenological change.
   Population data, gathered by standardised monitoring schemes, can be
   used to this end. However, such schemes require significant organisation
   and financial resources. Distribution data (georeferenced biological
   records with dates) are easier and cheaper to collect and may be an
   unexploited resource for phenology analyses. This would allow analysis
   of more taxa from more regions of the world. However, distribution data
   are potentially biased due to the unstandardised behaviour of biological
   recorders. Here, the ability of distribution data record dates to
   accurately predict phenology is investigated by using the British
   butterfly fauna as a model system. We used the total number of
   distribution records per unit time across Great Britain as a proxy for
   butterfly abundance. Phenology metrics of mean flight date and flight
   period length were then calculated from the resulting abundance-time
   relationships for each year in a 15-year time series. These estimates
   were validated against those generated from a standardised-effort
   population monitoring scheme. We analysed 1078328 records from 30
   British butterflies and found that distribution data accurately
   predicted the mean flight date for 22 of the 30 species tested. Flight
   period length was only predicted accurately for seven of 30 species. We
   found a nonlinear but consistent positive relationship between the
   accuracy of mean flight date estimates and sample size (number of
   records) at both inter- and intraspecific scales. Our results suggest
   that a threshold sample size of c. 6500 distribution records (430 per
   year) is a pragmatic compromise between accuracy and recording effort,
   leading to little loss of accuracy in phenology predictions (an average
   decrease in accuracy of 2<bold>9</bold>days was observed). The results
   suggest that distribution data are a potentially useful resource for
   phenology research. This may allow practitioners to monitor particular
   regions and previously unstudied species relatively cheaply using
   existing mapping schemes.

AB In this chapter, we discuss climate variability over the Western
   Himalaya based on instrumental records as well as information derived
   from tree-ring data. We focus here on two important climatological
   elements, namely rainfall and temperature of Western Himalayan region.
   Trend analyses of rainfall based on 14 stations covering entire western
   Himalayan region from Kashmir to Uttarakhanda indicate different
   patterns of rainfall variability. The database does not show any
   coherent patterns among the stations and does not indicate any
   significant trend during the twentieth century. Data on temperature show
   overall warming mainly contributed by maximum temperature. Most of the
   stations indicate significant increasing trends in maximum temperature
   for all the seasons. Cooling trend is observed mostly in minimum
   temperature of some stations for different seasons. Annual maximum,
   minimum and mean temperature series of all the stations indicate
   significant warming except slight cooling in minimum temperature of
   Deheradun, Mukteswar and Mussoorie. Climate projections for twenty-first
   century also indicate warming over the entire Himalayan region with
   significant warming in Tibetan plateau, and increasing trend in summer
   precipitation over the central Himalayan region including Nepal and
   Tibetan Plateau.
   Dendroclimatic reconstructions give some information about summer
   climate conditions since past several centuries. They indicate some cool
   epochs associated with Little Ice Age (LIA). It is also seen that high
   altitude near glacier tree-ring records would be the potential source of
   information on long-term temperature variability and glacier
   fluctuations. Overall warming trends noted in different parts of the
   western Himalaya may be linked partially to global warming trends and
   rapid urbanization of the hill stations were the observatories are
   located.

AB The hypothesis tested in the present study is a seasonal difference in
   the core interthreshold zone (CIZ), as we suggested in an earlier study
   that individual awareness of heat may change the CIZ due to
   thermoregulatory behavior. A series of human experiments were carried
   out in a climatic chamber in January and August of 2009 and January of
   2010. The air temperature in the chamber was controlled at 20-24 degrees
   C. Subjects wore a water-perfused suit that was perfused with 25 C water
   at a rate of 600 cc/min. They exercised on an ergometer at 50% of their
   maximum work rate for 10-15 min until their sweating rate increased and
   then remained seated without exercise until oxygen uptake increased.
   Subjects' rectal temperature and skin temperatures at four sites were
   monitored by thermistors. The sweating rate was measured at the forehead
   with a sweat rate monitor (SKD 4000, Skinos Co.). Oxygen uptake was
   monitored with a gas analyzer (Respiromonitor RM-300i, Minato Med.
   Science Co.). In the 2009 winter experiment, 5 male subjects were
   exposed to lighting of 36 cd/m(2)/1,050 lx, and in the 2009 summer and
   2010 winter experiments, 10 male subjects were exposed to lighting of 18
   cd/m(2)/510 lx. The results showed that the CIZ of 0.69 +/- 0.29 degrees
   C (n=22, data from 2005-2007 experiments) at 36 cd/m(2) and that of 0.37
   +/- 0.17 degrees C (n=10) at 18 cd/m(2) in summer were greater than the
   CIZ of 0.37 +/- 0.13 degrees C (n=5) at 36 cd/m(2) and that of 0.18 +/-
   0.17 degrees C (n=10) at 18 cd/m(2) in winter, and thus demonstrated a
   seasonal difference in the CIZ as well as an effect of lighting
   conditions on the CIZ. J Physiol Anthropol 30(4): 161-167, 2011

   and during the summers of 2006 and 2007, which were mild thermal stress
   years. The primary objectives were to (1) examine the spatial pattern of
   coral bleaching and its relationship to coral community composition and
   habitat and (2) determine the relationship between environmental
   parameters and coral-bleaching prevalence (i.e. the proportion of
   colonies that bleached within each population). Over 50% of all coral
   species bleached along much of the reef tract in 2005. The Lower Keys
   supported more colonies per unit area than elsewhere and showed the
   highest number of bleached coral colonies; Biscayne and the Middle Keys
   showed the highest coral-bleaching prevalence. The most thermally
   sensitive corals were Porites furcata, Millepora complanata, Siderastrea
   radians, Porites divaricata, Agaricia agaricites, Millepora alcicornis,
   and Porites porites. The most extensive bleaching was recorded for large
   colonies, >= 30 cm, except in 2005 when small branching Porites colonies
   (< 30 cm) showed higher bleaching prevalence. Shallow-water coral
   colonies and corals at localities with high productivity, in the form of
   chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration, showed
   higher bleaching prevalence than both deep coral colonies and corals at
   localities with low productivity. By locally regulating waste-water
   discharge from the land, and thereby reducing local primary
   productivity, the severity of coral bleaching may be reduced when
   subjected to high regional water temperatures.

AB In central Europe Adalia bipunctata (L.) occurs in two main colour
   morphs (typical, melanic), and A. decempunctata (L.) occurs in 3 morphs
   (spotted, chequered, dark). Temporal variation in the relative frequency
   of morphs was recorded in populations of the Czech Republic where
   geographic variation in morph frequency is low. Seasonal trends were
   investigated in samples collected by a light-trap run daily from March
   to November for 14 years. In A. bipunctata the melanic form was more
   abundant in autumn than in spring but the difference was not
   significant. In A. decempunctata morph proportions did not change
   seasonally. Samples were also collected by sweepnet from stands of many
   plant species. In both Adalia species the morph proportions did not
   differ significantly among collections made on different plants.
   Long-term changes in morph proportions were analysed by pooling annual
   samples over all host plants. In A. bipunctata, sampled in 15 years
   between 1971-2004, there was no significant change in proportion of
   typical (90.1 %) and melanic (9.9 %) forms. In A. decempunctata, sampled
   in 12 years between 1976-2004, the proportions of "spotted" (mean over
   the years 29.4 %), "chequered" (42.2 %) and "dark" (21.3 %) morphs
   varied between years. There was a trend toward an increasing proportion
   of the spotted form in the 2000s compared to the 1970s and 1980s.

AB Predicting the extent and direction of species' range shifts is a major
   priority for scientists and resource managers. Seminal studies have
   fostered the notion that biological systems responding to climate
   change-impacted variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) should
   exhibit poleward range shifts but shifts contrary to that expectation
   have been frequently reported. Understanding whether those shifts are
   indeed contrary to climate change predictions involves understanding the
   most basic mechanisms determining the distribution of species. We
   assessed the patterns of ecologically relevant temperature metrics
   (e.g., daily range, min, max) along the European Atlantic coast.
   Temperature metrics have contrasting geographical patterns and latitude
   or the grand mean are poor predictors for many of them. Our data suggest
   that unless the appropriate metrics are analysed, the impact of climate
   change in even a single metric of a single stressor may lead to range
   shifts in directions that would otherwise be classified as "contrary to
   prediction".

AB Climate change involves changes in mean temperature and precipitation as
   well as increases in extreme weather events; thus, determining how
   species will respond to climate change requires understanding how
   organisms respond to change in both mean and extreme conditions.
   Previously, we have shown that the growth of 21 interconnected
   populations of the alpine butterfly, Parnassius smintheus, is affected
   by prevailing climatic conditions during its overwintering period. More
   recently, we have shown that population growth is affected by extreme
   weather events during early overwintering. Here, we compare the
   descriptive and predictive abilities of models based on climate,
   weather, and their combination. We found that both climate-and
   weather-based models explain significant, but independent, variation in
   year-to-year changes in population abundance; the combination of both
   was not better than either individual model. None of the models showed
   consistently good predictive ability. The climate model was accurate in
   predicting relatively small changes in year-to-year abundance, but not
   large changes. In contrast, the weather model was poor at predicting
   small changes in abundance, but accurately predicted large changes. Our
   results indicate that a more mechanistic approach, linking specific
   conditions to vital rates and population growth, will be needed to
   predict population responses to changing abiotic conditions.

AB On the basis of 16-yr satellite time series (1987-2003) of sea surface
   temperature (SST) and using univariate and multivariate statistical
   techniques, we quantified patterns of fluctuation in oceanographic
   conditions, as well as their spatial structure along the coasts of South
   Africa and Chile between 29.0 degrees and 34.5 degrees S. Since
   variations in environmental conditions over multiple timescales are
   driven by oceanographic-atmospheric processes modulated by coastal
   morphology, all of which affect in different ways coastal organisms, we
   hypothesized that dynamic properties of the environment contribute to
   characteristic patterns on rocky intertidal biomass structure across
   upwelling ecosystems. Although long-term mean temperatures were similar
   between coasts, the relative importance of annual, semiannual,
   intraseasonal, and high-frequency SST fluctuations differed; South
   Africa is more strongly pulsed over shorter timescales. Similar spatial
   discontinuities in thermal regimes were observed, with changes at about
   32 degrees S. Multivariate summaries of benthic community structure
   derived from functional group biomasses revealed striking differences
   between South Africa and Chile, as well as between regions north and
   south of 32 degrees S within each ecosystem. Between-continent and
   regional-scale differences in community structure were largely unrelated
   to mean SST, but correlated with the different measures of temporal
   variance in SST. For all functional groups, as well as aggregate
   measures of benthic community composition, the weekly to annual SST
   fluctuations explained large fractions (> 35%) of biological
   variability. Results highlight the importance of quantifying the
   temporal variance of regimes of hydrographic conditions since
   multispecies assemblages are expected to respond in different ways to
   the driving oceanographic processes behind these fluctuations.

AB The effects of sustained anoxia on cardiac electrical excitability were
   examined in the anoxia-tolerant crucian carp (Carassius carassius). The
   electrocardiogram (ECG) and expression of excitationcontraction coupling
   genes were studied in fish acclimatised to normoxia in summer (+ 18
   degrees C) or winter (+ 2 degrees C), and in winter fish after 1, 3 and
   6 weeks of anoxia. Anoxia induced a sustained bradycardia from a heart
   rate of 10.3 +/- 0.77 beats min(-1) to 4.1 +/- 0.29 beats min(-1)
   (P<0.05) after 5 weeks, and heart rate slowly recovered to control
   levels when oxygen was restored. Heart rate variability greatly
   increased under anoxia, and completely recovered under reoxygenation.
   The RT interval increased from 2.8 +/- 0.34 s in normoxia to 5.8 +/-
   0.44 s under anoxia (P<0.05), which reflects a doubling of the
   ventricular action potential (AP) duration. Acclimatisation to winter
   induced extensive changes in gene expression relative to
   summer-acclimatised fish, including depression in those genes coding for
   the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (Serca2a_q2) and ATP-sensitive
   K+ channels (Kir6.2) (P<0.05). Genes of delayed rectifier K+ (kcnh6) and
   Ca2+ channels (cacna1c) were up-regulated in winter fish (P<0.05). In
   contrast, the additional challenge of anoxia caused only minor changes
   in gene expression, e. g. depressed expression of Kir2.2b K+ channel
   gene (kcnj12b), whereas expression of Ca2+ (cacna1a, cacna1c and
   cacna1g) and Na+ channel genes (scn4a and scn5a) was not affected. These
   data suggest that low temperature pre-conditions the crucian carp heart
   for winter anoxia, whereas sustained anoxic bradycardia and prolongation
   of AP duration are directly induced by oxygen shortage without major
   changes in gene expression.

AB The Northwest Atlantic stock of Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus is
   distributed from Cape Hatteras to New-foundland and migrates great
   distances on a seasonal basis. Atlanticmackerel are sensitive to changes
   in temperature, preferring water greater than 5 degrees C. Annual
   changes in the winter and early-spring distributions of Atlantic
   mackerel were investigated using satellite imagery, research trawl
   surveys, geographical information systems, and spatial and standard
   statistical analyses. During the past 40-plus years (1968-2008), the
   distribution of the stock has shifted about 250 km to the north and
   east. Also, a change has occurred in the depth distribution of the
   stock, from deeper off-shelf locations to shallower on-shelf ones. Areal
   and bathymetric changes in distribution are correlated with interannual
   temperature variability and gradual warming. These results have
   implications for U. S. commercial and recreational mackerel fisheries
   because, despite the current high abundance of the stock, the changes in
   distribution will probably make it more difficult to find and catch
   Atlantic mackerel in certain areas in the future.

   paper provides an original application to the study of red deer (Cervus
   elaphus L.) roaring activity, which could be wed as a biological
   indicator of variation of population size. Spectral and cross-spectral
   analysis have highlighted a strong correlation between the numbers of
   roaring red deer and the count of roars. These indicate that number of
   roarings can be confidently wed to monitor population size in this
   species. We did not observe any peak in the number of roars throughout
   the day. However, a 10-day period of peak intensity of roaring has been
   found. We propose therefore to sample throughout the entire day during
   this peak period in order to improve the sampling design.

AB Unexplained length-dependence of flexural rigidity and Young's modulus
   of microtubules is studied using an orthotropic elastic shell model. It
   is showed that vibration frequencies and buckling load predicted by the
   accurate orthotropic shell model are much lower than that given by the
   approximate isotropic beam model for shorter microtubules, although the
   two models give almost identical results for sufficiently long
   microtubules. It is this inaccuracy of the isotropic beam model used by
   all previous researchers that leads to reported lower flexural rigidity
   and Young's modulus for shorter microtubules. In particular, much lower
   shear modulus and circumferential Young's modulus, which only weaken
   flexural rigidity of shorter microtubules, are responsible for the
   observed length-dependence of the flexural rigidity. These results
   confirm that longitudinal Young's modulus of microtubules is length-in
   dependent, and the observed length-dependence of the flexural rigidity
   and Young's modulus is a result of strongly anisotropic elastic
   properties of microtubules which have a length-dependent weakening
   effect on flexural rigidity of shorter microtubules. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   changes in water temperature. In this study, we identified a warm-
   temperature acclimation-associated 65-kDa protein (Wap65) in the Kumgang
   fat minnow Rhynchocypris kumgangensis, a small, cold-freshwater fish
   species endemic to Korea. Kumgang fat minnow Wap65-1 (kmWap65-1) was
   cloned using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies, and was
   found to be highly homologous with teleost Wap65-1 and mammalian
   hemopexin, a heme-binding protein that transfers plasma heme into
   hepatocytes. kmWap65-1 mRNA was expressed mainly in the liver and its
   expression levels were significantly increased by both short- and
   long-term exposure to high temperature, which was evaluated by real-time
   quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the expression levels of kmWap65-1 were
   highly elevated by exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These
   results indicate that kmWap65-1 expression is associated with
   environmental stresses such as increases in water temperature and
   bacterial infection. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Hulun Buir Steppe, provide their formal definitions and describe their
   species composition, habitat affinities and distributions. Floristic
   features (including floristic composition, life form and plant water
   ecotypes, floristic geographical elements) were also assessed. We
   recorded a total of 765 vascular plant taxa belonging to 68 families and
   327 genera. The Hulun Buir Steppe indicates typical temperate steppe
   vegetation where the most frequent life form is hemicryptophytes with
   the maximum number of species. The most frequent water ecotype of Hulun
   Buir Steppe is typical-mesophytes. And the most frequent geographical
   element is the East Paleo-Arctic element. According to China vegetation
   classification system (China-VCS), the classification of 371 releves
   resulted in assignment into 31 formations (Form.) grouped into
   threeVegetation-types and eleven Vegetation-subtypes. Hulun Buir Steppe
   vegetation classifications were described for the first time based on
   complete floristic data and community survey data. Our conclusions show
   that among the 765 vascular plant taxa, the main plant group among all
   vascular plants in terms of species numbers comprises dicotyledons,
   followed by monocotyledons and pteridophyta, with gymnosperms
   demonstrating the lowest numbers. The life forms are dominated by
   hemicryptophytes, the water ecological type is dominated by
   typical-mesophytes, and the floristic geographical element is dominated
   by the East Palaeo-Arctic element. Plant community types are diverse and
   can be conceptualized as meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert
   steppe. The vegetation types of the Hulun Buir Steppe are mainly
   affected by geographic variables and climatic factors: the geographic
   variables are mainly affected by the change in precipitation caused by
   the longitude gradient, while the climatic factors are mainly affected
   by the East Asian winter monsoon caused by the Siberian High and the
   East Asian Summer Monsoon caused by the Western Pacific Subtropical
   High. In addition, the surface runoff caused by forest snowmelt and
   seasonal rainfall, as well as the distance from the Greater Khingan
   Mountains, also affect the distribution of the Hulun Buir Steppe
   vegetation. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   Southern Hemisphere and the tropics in relation to sea-surface
   temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS) at the corresponding
   sites. The process lengths show a moderate inverse relationship to
   summer SST (sSST) (R-2 = 0.44) and sSSS/sSST (R-2 = 0.4), however,
   lateral transport of cysts probably produced noise in the plots. After
   excluding tropical and Southern Hemisphere sites considered to have been
   affected by long distance lateral transport, the relationship between
   process length and density follows the equation sD = 0.8422x + 1016.9
   (R-2 = 0.55) with a Root Mean Square Error = 0.63 kg m(-3), while the

   characterized based on disease symptoms and conidia morphology. The
   disease symptoms, which became more evident in the spring, included
   drying up of needles and branches with some distortion of terminal
   twigs, resulting in dieback and sometimes to death of trees of all
   sizes. Variation in conidia size and growth rate was investigated
   between 15 isolates from Spain, and the conidia morphology was compared
   with four isolates from Finland, four from Switzerland and three from
   the US. Great variation occurred between Spanish isolates both in growth
   rates and in conidia size. The growth rates of the isolates were
   greatest on malt agar amended with pine needle extract and at
   15degreesC. The length and the width of the conidia of the isolates from
   Spain ranged between 10.7-44.8 and 1.5-4.4 mum, and most of them had
   three septa. The results suggest that the isolates from Spain do not
   belong to the Alpine biotype, and the disease symptoms caused by these
   isolates resembled those of the European biotype.

AB In New Jersey, Phytoplithora cinnamomi is the pathogen most commonly
   isolated from diseased roots and runners of the cultivated cranberry
   (Vaccinium macrocarpon). A second distinct species of Phytophthora has
   been isolated from dying cranberry plants and surface irrigation water.
   This species is homothallic with paragynous antheridia and
   ellipsoid-limoniform, nonpapillate sporangia. It was tentatively
   identified as P. megasperma in an earlier report. Laboratory experiments
   demonstrate that the cardinal temperatures for vegetative growth are
   between 5 and 30 degrees C with an optimum near 25 degrees C. Sporangia
   are produced at temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees C with the
   majority of sporangia produced at 10 and 15 degrees C. In pathogenicity
   tests, no growth effect was observed on cranberry plants (cv. Early
   Black) when tests were conducted at 25 degrees C; however, significant
   reductions in plant growth occurred when tests were conducted at 15
   degrees C. This species was insensitive to metalaxyl but was sensitive
   to buffered phosphorous acid. Sequence analysis of the internal
   transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), 5.8S rDNA, and ITS2 regions place these
   isolates in Phytoplithora clade 6 with greatest similarity to
   Phytophthora taxon raspberry. To our knowledge, this is the first report
   of isolates of this affiliation in North America. However, the
   observation of low temperature preferences makes this species unique in
   an otherwise high temperature clade. The isolates described in this
   study are tentatively classified as Phytophthora taxon cranberry.

AB In ectotherm species like Drosophila, morphometrical quantitative traits
   exhibit a large amount of phenotypic plasticity as a consequence of
   developmental temperature. Generally the response curves called reaction
   norms, are non-linear and exhibit either single max-ma or minima, or a
   sigmoid shape. Up to now, such complex shapes were mainly considered as
   non-adaptive, reflecting interactions between internal developmental
   constraints and the environment. We show that the general, all purpose
   method of polynomial adjustment provides a convenient way for the
   description of the norms. From the polynomial parameters, characteristic
   values with an obvious biological significance (e.g, the temperature of
   a maximum size), can be calculated and used for comparing populations or
   species. Experimental data on body pigmentation and body size show that
   the shapes of the reaction norms are genetically variable and suggest
   adaptive responses to the environment. The possible occurrence of
   specific regulatory genes acting on norm shape will be a matter fur
   further investigations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Understanding the carbon dynamics of the terrestrial biosphere during
   climate fluctuations is a prerequisite for any reliable modeling of the
   climate-carbon cycle feedback. We drive a terrestrial vegetation model
   with observed climate data to show that most of the fluctuations in
   atmospheric CO2 are consistent with the modeled shift in the balance
   between carbon uptake by terrestrial plants and carbon loss through soil
   and plant respiration. Simulated anomalies of the Fraction of Absorbed
   Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) during the last two El Nino
   events also agree well with satellite observations. Our model results
   suggest that changes in net primary productivity (NPP) are mainly
   responsible for the observed anomalies in the atmospheric CO2 growth
   rate. Changes in heterotrophic respiration (R-h) mostly happen in the
   same direction, but with smaller amplitude. We attribute the unusual
   acceleration of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate during 2002-2003 to a
   coincidence of moderate El Nino conditions in the tropics with a strong
   NPP decrease at northern mid latitudes, only partially compensated by
   decreased R-h.

AB The relationship between development rate of an ectotherm and
   temperature in experiments where insects or mites are reared under
   several constant temperatures, while non-linear over the entire range,
   can be approximately described by a line in the mid-temperature range.
   It was hypothesized that the development rate lines of ectotherms within
   a taxon such as a family would have a common intersection. Thus for a
   given temperature, the development time should be the same for all the
   species within any specified taxon. In the current study, the data on
   temperature-dependent development rates of species of the Aphididae and
   Tetranychidae families were used to test the validity of the
   common-intersection hypothesis. The hypothesis was supported with either
   dataset used. In addition, the current study tested the
   common-intersection hypothesis through mathematical analysis on the
   basis of two linear relationships (i.e., the linear relationship between
   temperature and development rate and that between the lower
   developmental threshold and the sum of effective temperatures). An
   attempt was made to combine the rate isomorphy hypothesis that all the
   lower developmental thresholds of different stages were assumed to be
   equal for a single species with the common-intersection hypothesis for
   related species within a taxon and hypothesize that if these two
   hypotheses hold, then for any developmental stages a common temperature
   of all stages should exist. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Planting time effect on genetic potential of wheat advanced lines for

   and heritability during 2012-2013 at The University of Agriculture,
   Peshawar, Pakistan. The breeding material comprising fifteen wheat
   genotypes including 12 advanced lines and three check cultivars. All the
   genotypes were grown under normal and late planting conditions in a
   randomized complete block design with three replications. According to
   analysis of variance, genotypes revealed significant (p = 0.01)
   differences for all the traits except days to maturity. For
   environments, highly significant differences were observed for majority
   of the traits; however, flag leaf area and 1000-grain weight were
   non-significant. Genotype x environment interactions were highly
   significant for days to heading, grains per spike and grain weight per
   spike while for grain yield it was merely significant (p <= 0.05).
   Significance of wheat genotypes, environments and genotype by
   environment interaction authenticated that differences might be due to
   diverse genetic makeup of the genotypes and their interaction with
   environments. According to genetic variability, yield traits revealed
   low to high heritability (0.14 to 0.64) which provides reliability and
   more chances to the genotypes to be recognized by expression of their
   phenotypes and effective selection. On average, the grain yield of the
   genotypes was reduced by 20.14% due to late planting. Overall, genotype
   DIK-2 was found superior followed by lines DIK-1, NIFA-1 and NIFA-5
   under normal planting. However, lines NIFA-1 and PS/CCRI-2 were the best
   performers with late planting. These lines could be further utilized for
   commercial cultivation as well as in future breeding programs to evolve
   new cultivars with good yield potential.

AB Force generation by actin assembly shapes cellular membranes. An
   experimentally constrained multiscale model shows that a minimal
   branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits
   against membrane tension. Around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are
   required for robust internalization. A newly developed molecule-counting
   method determined that similar to 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites
   of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict
   that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends
   oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between
   attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit. Elastic energy
   stored in bent filaments, whose presence was confirmed by cryo-electron
   tomography, contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane
   tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit,
   increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production.
   Thus, spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive
   mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints.

   landscapes has important biological and ecological consequences because

   thermal landscapes provides aquatic organisms with options to maximize
   growth and survival. However, human activities and climate change
   threaten to alter the dynamics of riverine thermal regimes. New data and
   tools can identify particular facets of the thermal landscape that

   actions. The emerging complexity of thermal landscapes demands
   innovations in communication, opens the door to exciting research
   opportunities on the human impacts to and biological consequences of
   thermal variability, suggests improvements in monitoring programs to
   better capture empirical patterns, provides a framework for suites of

   activity of CO2 fixation in the rooted leaves cultured under the control
   condition (10-h light/14-h darkness, 730 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1))
   remained constant and high. When the leaves kept for 8 or 9 d under the

   activity decreased steeply. The starch content increased significantly
   during the first 2 d in CL whereas the sucrose content increased almost
   linearly during the 4 d in CL, The close relationship between the
   decrease in photosynthetic activity and the increase in sucrose
   indicates that the activity was subjected to feedback inhibition when
   the end product was forced to accumulate in the leaves. In the treated
   leaves, the initial activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphoshate carboxylase
   decreased significantly. A large increase in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   and decrease in 3-phosphoglycerate occurred following the deactivation
   in RuBPcase, which was fully restored by the preincubation with CO2 and
   Mg2+ and/or P-i and Mg2+ The activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
   also decreased but not as rapidly as RuBPcase. The alanine and pyruvate
   levels decreased markedly but the oxaloacetate, glutamine and asparagine
   levels significantly increased while phosphoenolpyruvate and glutamate
   were kept at almost constant levels. The malate level first increased
   slightly and then decreased significantly. The mechanism of coordinated
   decrease in carboxylation reactions between phtosynthetic carbon
   reduction cycle and C-4 metabolism in response to change in the
   source-sink balance is discussed.

   factors limiting the success of S. pectinata. Distribution and biomass
   of S. pectinata differed significantly over the years of this study.
   Biomass was related to environmental factors, including water
   transparency and water temperature early in the season. Water
   transparency during May (time of early growth) had a negative
   relationship with maximum biomass at each site over all years. Water
   temperature had a positive relationship with increases in seasonal

   leaf and bud nematode (Aphelenchoides besseyi Christie 1942) can cause
   substantial yield loss in rice. Whitening of leaf tips is the
   characteristics damage symptom of this nematode and therefore it is
   popularly referred to as the rice white tip nematode (RWTN). While
   information on the damage severity of RWTN is available from others
   parts of the country, to date, no information is available from the
   state of Jharkhand. In order to generate a detailed information on
   spatial distribution of this nematode and to identify infestation
   hotspots, extensive field sampling was conducted across the Giridih
   district of Jharkhand. In total, 163 samples with each sample consisting
   of 30 randomly chosen panicles from three nearby rice fields were
   collected across the district. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation test
   confirmed the presence of significant spatial clustering among the
   sampling locations. Optimized hotspot analysis found the presence of one
   significant hotspot in Dumri block and cold spots in adjoining areas of
   Gawan, Tisri, and Dhanwar blocks. Spatial interpolation techniques like
   inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK) were employed
   to predict the population density at unsampled locations. Both IDW and
   OK resulted into generation of similar kind of maps where population
   density was found to be higher in Dumri, an an, Bongabad and some other
   pockets of the district. Finally, indicator kriging approach was
   employed which resulted into identifying both risk and nematode free
   areas. In risk areas, where the probability of the population density
   exceeding the economic threshold limit is high, immediate quarantine
   measures should be taken to prevent further dissemination of
   contaminated seeds. Our study provided a scientifically based decision
   method to devise preventive and curative protection measures against A.
   besseyi, a neglected pest of quarantine significance of rice in India.

   forests and mangrove swamps reached Cape Blanc, 5-degrees-N of the
   present distribution. Between 3.5 and 2.6 Ma, forests occurred at this
   latitude during irregular intervals and nearly disappeared afterwards.
   Likewise, a Saharan paleoriver flowed continuously until isotope Stage
   134 (3.35 Ma). When river discharge ceased, wind transport of pollen
   grains prevailed over fluvial transport. Pollen indicators of trade
   winds gradually increased between 3.3 and 2.5 Ma. A strong aridification
   of the climate of northwestern Africa occurred during isotope Stage 130
   (3.26 Ma). Afterwards, humid conditions reestablised followed by another
   aridification around 2.7 Ma. Repetitive latitudinal shifts of vegetation
   zones ranging from wooded savanna to desert flora dominated for the
   first time between between 2.6 and 2.4 Ma as a response to the glacial

AB The germination ecology of Sideritis serrata was investigated in order
   to improve ex-situ propagation techniques and management of their
   habitat. Specifically, we analysed: (i) influence of temperature, light
   conditions and seed age on germination patterns; (ii) phenology of
   germination; (iii) germinative response of buried seeds to seasonal
   temperature changes; (iv) temperature requirements for induction and
   breaking of secondary dormancy; (v) ability to form persistent soil seed
   banks; and (vi) seed bank dynamics. Freshly matured seeds showed
   conditional physiological dormancy, germinating at low and cool
   temperatures but not at high ones (28/14 and 32/18 degrees C).
   Germination ability increased with time of dry storage, suggesting the
   existence of non-deep physiological dormancy. Under unheated shade-house
   conditions, germination was concentrated in the first autumn. S.serrata
   seeds buried and exposed to natural seasonal temperature variations in
   the shade-house, exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy
   cycle, coming out of conditional dormancy in summer and re-entering it
   in winter. Non-dormant seeds were clearly induced into dormancy when
   stratified at 5 or 15/4 degrees C for 8weeks. Dormant seeds, stratified
   at 28/14 or 32/18 degrees C for 16weeks, became non-dormant if they were
   subsequently incubated over a temperature range from 15/4 to 32/18
   degrees C. S.serrata is able to form small persistent soil seed banks.
   The maximum seed life span in the soil was 4years, decreasing with
   burial depth. This is the second report of an annual conditional
   dormancy/non-dormancy cycle in seeds of shrub species.

AB P>Small-scale distributions of rocky intertidal organisms may be
   determined in part by temperature and desiccation stress during low tide
   and the ability of organisms to resist such stresses. Biophysical
   modelling techniques, coupled with data on the physiological tolerance
   of organisms can be used to predict the frequency and severity of
   abiotic stress events.
   The limpet Lottia gigantea is a major competitor for primary space on
   rocky shores along the west coast of North America. The goal of this
   study was to quantify the thermal and desiccation tolerance of this
   species and to predict the frequency of stressful events at Hopkins
   Marine Station (HMS) in Pacific Grove, CA, USA.
   Lottia gigantea were exposed to thermal stress regimes in the laboratory
   using protocols designed to mimic prolonged exposures in the field. The
   production of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was measured as an indicator
   of sub-lethal stress, and mortality rates were measured.
   Peak expression of Hsp70 occurred during exposures at 32 degrees C,
   while the lethal limits of the limpets ranged between 30 and 42 degrees
   C, depending on the exposure regime. Lethal temperatures were
   approximately 5 degrees C lower in 50-60% relative humidity conditions
   compared to 100% relative humidity trials.
   Results from the physiology experiments were compared to field surveys
   of the upper limits of L. gigantea at HMS and with heat-budget model
   predictions of limpet body temperatures on a variety of substratum
   orientations.
   The highest frequency of sub-lethal and lethal stress events was
   predicted to occur on high-shore westerly and southerly slopes and
   horizontal surfaces, microhabitats where L. gigantea is comparatively
   rare at HMS. Predicted stress and mortality events were rare at
   low-shore sites, vertical surfaces, and sloping rock faces oriented
   towards the northeast and northwest.
   The combination of direct measurements of sub-lethal and lethal
   temperature thresholds using realistic stress exposures and predictions
   from a heat-budget model give insight into the role of thermal
   disturbance in affecting the local-scale distributions of intertidal
   organisms. These methods hold great promise for enhancing our
   understanding of the role of abiotic factors in limiting species
   distributions and making predictions about responses to future climatic
   conditions.

AB Wild endangered populations can suffer from adverse effects on fitness
   due to inbreeding and environmental stress. Often, both genetic and
   environmental stress factors may be present in populations at the same
   time. Therefore knowledge on the potential interactions between these
   factors is important for the conservation of wild populations. When
   measuring fitness (e. g. survival and reproductive potential) of
   individuals in the laboratory, and in nature, inbreeding by environment
   interactions are now being reported more often. The increased focus on
   environmental dependency of inbreeding depression will therefore enable
   conservation biologists to include this knowledge in the management of
   endangered populations in the wild. In this study, the effects of
   environmental stress and inbreeding on fitness are estimated in a
   laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Random- or full-sib mating
   were used to generate independent replicate lines of four different
   inbreeding levels (F = 0, F = 0.25, F = 0.50, F = 0.672) in four
   different environments. The environments were thermal and dimethoate
   stress separately and in combination, as well as a non-stressful control
   environment. Two experiments were carried out to measure productivity (a
   multiplicative measure of fecundity and viability) using a full
   factorial design. In the first experiment, productivity was estimated
   for all lines and inbreeding levels in the environment in which flies
   were inbred and reared for several generations. In the second
   experiment, productivity of the lines reared in the control environment
   was tested in all four environments and for all inbreeding levels. Our
   results show a significant effect of inbreeding and environmental stress
   on productivity in both experiments and the effect increased when flies
   were exposed to novel environmental conditions. Productivity was not
   affected by the interaction between inbreeding and environmental stress
   when flies were tested in the environments in which they were reared,
   whereas there was a tendency towards a stress by inbreeding interaction
   when flies were exposed to novel environments. The variance and the
   coefficient of variation in productivity were each affected by
   environmental stress and inbreeding, indicating that environmental
   conditions as well as genetic background are important for variation in
   productivity. However, the two measures of variation often showed
   opposite trends. The results obtained in this study indicate that the
   environmental conditions under which inbreeding occurs are important.
   This is relevant for the maintenance and management of populations in
   captivity and in relation to reintroduction of endangered species in
   nature.

AB Vertebrate ectotherms may deal with changes of environmental
   temperatures by behavioral and/or physiological mechanisms. Reptiles
   inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily
   temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with
   altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation
   in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest
   altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from
   elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental
   temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum
   temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of
   individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus
   exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental
   temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit
   intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations,
   tended to the "static" side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum.
   The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely
   plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions
   from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of
   the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest
   altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our
   study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal
   ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics
   that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards
   than previously thought.

   trained (TG) (21.51 +/- 1.25years, 182.17 +/- 4.37cm and 82.88 +/-
   11.23kg) and ten untrained (NTG) (23.89 +/- 3.17years, 176.8 +/- 2.2cm
   and 82.24 +/- 8.43kg) - participated in a crossover randomized study.
   They were asked to perform a 30-s Wingate test during six experimental
   sessions (three at 08:00 and three at 18:00h) after different active
   warm-up (AWU) durations (5min, 15min, or 20min). The AWU consisted of
   pedaling at a constant pace of 60rpm against 50% of maximal aerobic
   power. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded after the AWU and
   again immediately after the Wingate test. Heart rate and temperature (T)
   were recorded during each session at rest, after AWU and immediately at
   the end of the Wingate test. During the Wingate test, peak power (PP),
   mean power (MP), and the fatigue index were recorded. While the RPE
   estimations were higher in NTG, no time-of-day effect was recorded in
   either experimental group (morning or evening). T, PP, and MP were
   higher in the afternoon than in the morning (ppT). Similarly, PP and MP
   during the Wingate test were significantly higher in the TG than in the
   NTG (p<0.001). The morning-evening difference of PP and MP was affected
   by AWU duration; AWU(15) was best in the morning for improving lower
   limb power for both the TG and NTG, whereas reducing this period to 5min
   in the evening was appropriate for TG only.

AB The California market squid (Loligo opalescens) has been harvested since
   the 1860s and it has become the largest fishery in California in terms
   of tonnage and dollars since 1993. The fishery began in Monterey Bay and
   then shifted to southern California, where effort has increased steadily
   since 1983. The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) collects
   information on landings of squid, including tonnage, location, and date
   of capture. We compared landings data gathered by CDFG with sea surface
   temperature (SST), upwelling index (UI), the southern oscillation index
   (SOI), and their respective anomalies. We found that the squid fishery
   in Monterey Bay expends twice the effort of that in southern California.
   Squid landings decreased substantially following large El Nino events in
   1982-83 and 1997-98, but not following the smaller El Nino events of
   1987 and 1992. Spectral analysis revealed autocorrelation at annual and
   4.5-year intervals (similar to the time period between El Nino cycles).
   But this analysis did not reveal any fortnightly or monthly spawning
   peaks, thus squid spawning did not correlate with tides. A paralarvae
   density index (PDI) for February correlated well with catch per unit of
   effort (CPUE) for the following November recruitment of adults to the
   spawning grounds. This stock-recruitment analysis was significant for
   2000-03 (CPUE=8.42+0.41PDI, adjusted coefficient of determination,
   r(2)=0.978, P=0.0074). Surveys of squid paralarvae explained 97.8% of
   the variance for catches of adult squid nine months later. The
   regression of CPUE on PDI could be used to manage the fishery. Catch
   limits for the fishery could be set on the basis of paralarvae abundance
   surveyed nine months earlier.

AB As the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu has suffered
   from overfishing, eutrophication, and physical disturbance over the last
   several decades. Evaluating and quantifying changes in the ecosystem can
   help us better understand and develop hypotheses to explain the dynamics
   of the ecosystem. In this study, trophic interactions and community
   structure of commercial fisheries species of Lake Taihu ecosystem were
   analyzed and compared for three time periods (1961-1965, 1981-1987, and
   1991-1995) using the Ecopath with Ecosim model with the aim of
   evaluating the changes in the population dynamics and ecosystem
   development mechanism spanning the period from the 1960s to 1990s. The
   results show that the biomass of large predators decreased over the
   three decades, while the biomass of small species increased. Increases
   in the P/B ratios and fishing mortality levels observed for species
   groups reveal rapidly intensifying fishery stress over the three
   decades. The fisheries operated at the highest trophic level during the
   1980s, and there are some indications of "fishing down the food web" in
   this ecosystem between the 1980s and the 1990s. Drawing upon Odum's
   theory of ecosystem maturity, the structured, web-like ecosystem of the
   1960s developed into a highly mature system during the 1980s; yet, in
   the 1990s, this structure became less complex and the system's maturity
   fell to its lowest observed level. During this period, the successional
   development of the system occurred in reverse.

AB The fate of every eukaryotic cell subtly relies on the exceptional

   understanding their unusual mechanics remains elusive. One persistent,
   unresolved mystery is the formation of long-lived arcs and rings, e.g.,
   in kinesin-driven gliding assays. To elucidate their physical origin we
   develop a model of the inner workings of the microtubule's lattice,
   based on recent experimental evidence for a conformational switch of the
   tubulin dimer. We show that the microtubule lattice itself coexists in
   discrete polymorphic states. Metastable curved states can be induced via
   a mechanical hysteresis involving torques and forces typical of few
   molecular motors acting in unison, in agreement with the observations.

AB Altitudinal gradients offer a good opportunity to study organisms'
   adaptations to clinal environmental variables. Regarding altitude, the
   most influential variables on organisms are temperature and ultraviolet
   (UV) solar radiation, the first decreasing and the second increasing
   with altitude. Both variables affect ectotherms' biology, as ectotherms
   depend on environmental temperature for thermoregulation, frequently
   being heliotherms. Here, we studied dorsal coloration in the lizard
   Psammodromus algirus (Linnaeus, 1758) along a wide altitudinal gradient
   (2200 m) in Sierra Nevada (south-east Spain). We hypothesize that the
   skin will be darker with altitude, i.e. in environments with lower
   temperatures and higher UV radiation intensity. Results show that
   individual dorsal colorations became darker at high altitude. We propose
   two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this result: (1) darker
   dorsal surface would favour faster warming at high altitudes, where
   temperature is lower, and (2) darker dorsal surface would protect
   against UV radiation, stronger at high altitudes. We found significant
   relationships between both temperature and UV radiation and population
   dorsal darkness, giving mixed support for the two explanations.
   Moreover, dorsal hue was positively correlated with substrate hue,
   suggesting that hue evolved to maximize crypsis. Our study therefore
   suggests that geographical variation in dorsal coloration in this lizard
   is adaptive, and darkness coloration might have evolved in response to
   adverse conditions (low temperature and high UV radiation) at high
   altitudes. (c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of

   Dark respiration and light-saturating photosynthesis were measured as
   oxygen exchange; the characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence were
   also assayed. The maximal photochemical yield (F-v/F-m) and maximum
   relative electron transport rates (rETR(max)) remained stable with
   moderate fluctuations of temperature (15-30 degrees C) in the short
   term. However, the values of F-v/F-m and rETR(max) declined with the
   high temperature (>= 35 degrees C), and such a decline was more
   accentuated in 15 degrees C- than 25 degrees C-grown algae. Both the
   rates of photosynthesis and respiration were sensitive to measurement
   temperature, with the Q(10) values being higher in 25 degrees C-grown
   algae (HN) than 15 degrees C-grown algae. It appeared that 25 degrees
   C-grown algae displayed an optimum temperature (T-opt) of 30 degrees C
   for photosynthesis, while 15 degrees C-grown algae exhibited the T-opt
   of a range of 20-30 degrees C. When measured at their respective growth
   temperature, the rates of photosynthesis were significant higher in 25
   degrees C-than 15 degrees C-grown algae, while the rates of respiration
   were identical between 25 degrees C- and 15 degrees C-grown algae. Our
   results demonstrated that respiration displayed full acclimation;
   whereas, photosynthesis exhibited partial acclimation to changing growth
   temperatures in U. conglobata. Consequently, the balance between
   respiration and gross photosynthesis was re-established by changing
   growth temperature, with the ratio being lowered with warmer growth
   temperature. The results also showed that HN availability in culture
   significantly increased pigments and soluble protein contents and
   enhanced photosynthesis and respiration. We suggested that the
   acclimation potential of metabolisms in U. conglobata favored carbon
   acquisition and net carbon balance with the increasing seawater
   temperature resulting from climate change and/or increasing N loading
   from coastal eutrophication.

AB Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA) in acral skin (palms and soles) have a
   huge capacity to shunt blood directly from the arteries to the
   superficial venous plexus of the extremities. We hypothesized that acral
   skin, which supplies blood to the superficial venous plexus, has a
   stronger influence on blood flow adjustments during cooling in
   thermoneutral subjects than does non-acral skin. Thirteen healthy
   subjects were exposed to stepwise cooling from 32 degrees C to 25
   degrees C and 17 degrees C in a climate chamber. Laser Doppler flux and
   skin temperature were measured simultaneously from the left and right
   third finger pulp and bilateral upper arm skin. Coherence and
   correlation analyses were performed of short-term fluctuations at each
   temperature interval. The flux from finger pulps showed the synchronous
   spontaneous fluctuations characteristic of skin areas containing AVAs.
   Fluctuation frequency, amplitude and synchronicity were all higher at 25
   degrees C than at 32 degrees C and 17 degrees C (p < 0.02). Bilateral
   flux from the upper arm skin showed an irregular, asynchronous vasomotor
   pattern with small amplitudes which were independent of ambient
   temperature. At 32 degrees C, ipsilateral median flux values from the
   right arm (95% confidence intervals) were 492 arbitrary units (au) (417,
   537) in finger pulp and 43 au (35, 60) in upper arm skin. Flux values
   gradually decreased in finger pulp to 246 au (109, 363) at 25 degrees C,
   before an abrupt fall occurred at a median room temperature of 24
   degrees C, resulting in a flux value of 79 au (31,116) at 17 degrees C.
   In the upper arm skin a gradual fall throughout the cooling period to 21
   au (13, 27) at 17 degrees C was observed. The fact that the response of
   blood flow to ambient cooling is stronger in acral skin than in
   non-acral skin suggests that AVAs have a greater capacity to adjust
   blood flow in thermoneutral zone than arterioles in non-acral skin. (C)

AB Lake Erie and its tributaries have experienced extensive changes in
   environmental conditions and community structure during recent decades.
   To assess the relative importance of environmental conditions in
   determining fish community composition, fish communities and their
   associated environmental conditions were sampled from the lower reaches
   and mouths of the tributaries flowing into the northeastern basin of
   Lake Erie. These data were used to assess relationships between habitat
   and fish community composition on spatial and temporal scales using
   correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.
   Multivariate analyses revealed that the fish assemblage was size
   structured and related to water chemistry but also showed influences due
   to temperature, sampling date and aquatic macrophytes. The community
   composition showed the effects of biotic interactions, predominantly
   negative predator-prey associations, but there were also assemblage
   differences specific to particular tributaries and sampling
   methodologies.

AB Stomatal regulation is a key determinant of plant photosynthesis and
   water relations, influencing plant survival, adaptation, and growth.
   Stomata sense the surrounding environment and respond rapidly to abiotic
   and biotic stresses. Stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) and/or
   transpiration (E) are therefore valuable physiological parameters to be
   monitored in plant and agricultural sciences. However, leaf gas exchange
   measurements involve contact with leaves and often interfere with leaf
   functioning. Besides, they are time consuming and are limited by the
   sampling characteristics (e.g. sample size and/or the high number of
   samples required). Remote and rapid means to assess g(s) or E are thus
   particularly valuable for physiologists, agronomists, and ecologists.
   Transpiration influences the leaf energy balance and, consequently, leaf
   temperature (T-leaf). As a result, thermal imaging makes it possible to
   estimate or quantify g(s) and E. Thermal imaging has been successfully
   used in a wide range of conditions and with diverse plant species. The
   technique can be applied at different scales (e.g. from single
   seedlings/leaves through whole trees or field crops to regions),
   providing great potential to study plantenvironment interactions and
   specific phenomena such as abnormal stomatal closure, genotypic
   variation in stress tolerance, and the impact of different management
   strategies on crop water status. Nevertheless, environmental variability
   (e.g. in light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed)
   affects the accuracy of thermal imaging measurements. This review
   presents and discusses the advantages of thermal imaging applications to
   plant science, agriculture, and ecology, as well as its limitations and
   possible approaches to minimize them, by highlighting examples from
   previous and ongoing research.

   while calcium did not exhibit any rhythmicity. The rhythmic parameters
   of mesor, amplitude and acrophase analysis showed significant (p < 0.05)
   effects of season. The amplitudes, except for ALP, were greater during
   the harmattan. The acrophase, except for CPK and urea, were all
   restricted to the light phase of the light-dark cycle. The results,
   demonstrated strong seasonal changes on the daily rhythmicity of CT and

   which could be useful for researchers, clinicians and agriculturists
   under different climatic conditions.

AB Exposing flight hardware to dry heat is a NASA-approved sterilization
   method for reducing microbial bioburden on spacecraft. The existing NASA
   specification only allows heating the flight hardware between 104
   degrees C and 125 degrees C to reduce the number of viable microbes and
   bacterial spores. Also, the NASA specifications only allow a four log
   reduction by dry heat microbial reduction because very heat-resistant
   spores are presumed to exist in a diverse population (0.1%). The goal of
   this research was to obtain data at higher temperatures than 125 degrees
   C for one of the most heat-resistant microorganisms discovered in a
   spacecraft assembly area. These data support expanding the NASA
   specifications to temperatures higher than 125 degrees C and relaxing
   the four log reduction specification.
   Small stainless steel vessels with spores of the Bacillus strain ATCC
   29669 were exposed to constant temperatures between 125 degrees C and
   200 degrees C under both dry and ambient room humidity for set time
   durations. After exposures, the thermal spore exposure vessels were
   cooled and the remaining spores recovered and plated out. Survivor
   ratios, lethality rate constants, and D-values were determined at each
   temperature. The D-values for the spores exposed under dry humidity
   conditions were always found to be shorter than those under ambient
   humidity. The temperature dependence of the lethality rate constants was
   obtained by assuming that they obeyed Arrhenius behavior. The results
   are compared to those of B. atrophaeus ATCC 9372. In all cases, the
   D-values of ATCC 29669 are between 20 and 50 times longer than those of
   B. atrophaeus ATCC 9372.

AB Extreme climatic events, including heat waves (HWs) and severe storms,
   influence the structure of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite
   growing consensus that anthropogenic climate change will increase the
   frequency, duration and magnitude of extreme events, current
   understanding of their impact on communities and ecosystems is limited.
   Here, we used sessile invertebrates on settlement panels as model
   assemblages to examine the influence of HW magnitude, duration and
   timing on marine biodiversity patterns. Settlement panels were deployed
   in a marina in southwest UK for >= 5 weeks, to allow sufficient time for
   colonisation and development of sessile fauna, before being subjected to
   simulated HWs in a mesocosm facility. Replicate panel assemblages were
   held at ambient sea temperature (similar to 17 degrees C), or +3 degrees
   C or +5 degrees C for a period of 1 or 2 weeks, before being returned to
   the marina for a recovery phase of 2-3 weeks. The 10-week experiment was
   repeated 3 times, staggered throughout summer, to examine the influence
   of HW timing on community impacts. Contrary to our expectations, the
   warming events had no clear, consistent impacts on the abundance of
   species or the structure of sessile assemblages. With the exception of 1
   high-magnitude long-durationHWevent, warming did not alter not
   assemblage structure, favour non-native species, nor lead to changes in
   richness, abundance or biomass of sessile faunal assemblages. The
   observed lack of effect may have been caused by a combination of (1) the
   use of relatively low magnitude, realistic heat wave treatments compared
   to previous studies (2), the greater resilience of mature adult sessile
   fauna compared to recruits and juveniles, and (3) the high thermal
   tolerance of the model organisms (i.e., temperate fouling species,
   principally bryozoans and ascidians). Our study demonstrates the
   importance of using realistic treatments when manipulating climate
   change variables, and also suggests that biogeographical context may
   influence community-level responses to short-term warming events, which
   are predicted to increase in severity in the future.

   in Campeche, Mexico, a place with a high rate of suicide deaths and near
   the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer. The results showed that total
   suicides and sunshine were positively correlated (r = 0.649; p = 0.022)
   and the peak of maximum light in June coincides with the maximum suicide
   peak. There were non-significant peaks of higher suicides in June and
   December for men and in May for women. However, a clear, significant
   peak (p = 0.003) showed up in spring. We recommend strengthening the
   prevention programs during these periods.

AB Mean increases in temperatures associated with climate change are
   largely driven by increases in minimum (nighttime) temperatures;
   however, most climate change studies disproportionately increase maximum
   (daytime) temperatures. We review current literature to compare the
   potential effects of increasing daytime and nighttime temperatures on
   insects and their interactions within ecological communities. Although
   few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of nighttime warming,
   we draw from broader literature on how insects are affected by
   temperature to identify possible mechanisms that the timing (day or
   night) of warming may affect insects. Specifically, we discuss daily
   temperature variation, thermal performance curves, behaviour and
   activity patterns, nighttime recovery from hot days, and bottom-up
   effects mediated by plants. Although limited, the existing evidence
   suggests nighttime and daytime warming can have different effects, and
   thus we encourage scientists to use the most realistic warming
   treatments possible to truly understand how insects and their
   communities will be affected by climate change.

AB Thermal acclimation of metabolism was evaluated in Anolis gundlachi, a
   neotropical, montane lizard endemic to Puerto Rico (18 degrees N
   latitude). Because A. gundlachi does not compensate for altitudinal
   variation in environmental conditions using thermoregulatory behavior
   such as basking, I tested whether a physiological adjustment of
   metabolism occurs among lizards from populations at different altitudes.
   Aerobic metabolism was measured in freshly collected lizards and those
   maintained at 15 C or 30 C for a period of six or 14 days. I found no
   change in metabolism associated with altitudinal variation. Anolis
   gundlachi from low (El Verde, 350-400 m) and high (El Yunque, 850-900 m)
   altitudes had equivalent metabolic rates (shown in tests of freshly
   collected lizards and those tested after an acclimation period of six or
   14 days). Moreover, A. gundlachi also lacked a clear capacity for
   metabolic compensation to thermal variation. No change in metabolic rate
   (or body mass) occurred after exposure to a lower than usual temperature
   (15 C). However, a decrease in metabolism and mass loss occurred after
   exposure to a higher than usual temperature (30 C), which appears to be
   an effect of thermal stress. Absence of distinct metabolic or behavioral
   mechanisms to compensate for altitudinal variation in environmental
   conditions may limit the geographic distribution of A. gundlachi.

AB My hypothesis integrates molecular and whole-organism levels of
   development. A physico-chemical property of nucleotides (their dipole
   moment), confers structural thermostability on double-stranded
   sequences, and decreases chemical stability of single-stranded
   sequences. According to this approach, low ribosomal RNA stability
   should decrease the precision of protein synthesis and whole-organism
   developmental stability. Indeed, substitution frequencies in pseudogenes
   are proportional to the subtraction of the dipole moment of the
   substituting nucleotide from that of the substituted one, and
   developmental instability, estimated by morphological fluctuating
   asymmetry (FA), correlates with mammal 12s rRNA base content of loop
   (but not stem) regions. In lizards, fit to the single-strand rationale
   of sequence chemical stability decreases with the level of poikilothermy
   of the investigated lizard family, suggesting interactions between
   changes in body temperature, ribosomal structure and developmental
   instability. Results confirm the hypothesis (less than for 12s rRNA) in:
   third codon positions of cytochrome B, probably because, unlike rRNAs,
   specific mRNAs affect only the protein they code; and 16 s rRNA,
   apparently because its base composition is more affected by genome-wide
   mutational biases than that of 12s rRNA. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Aims
   Vegetation dynamics are simultaneously regulated by climate change and
   anthropogenic activities. Since the 1980s, climate has been warming on
   the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at a rate higher than North Hemisphere average.
   Anthropogenic activities, including grazing, farming, and urbanization,
   are also influencing the alpine ecosystem on the TP. Especially, an
   ensemble of large engineering projects, such as power transported from
   west to east by State Grid, has been in operation on the TP. While
   studies disentangling effects of climate and anthropogenic activities
   interference are still lacking for the forest ecosystems on the TP. The
   overarching objectives of this study were to separate effects of natural
   climates and human interferences on forest ecosystem dynamics on the TP.
   Methods
   We compared vegetation activities of two typical natural reserves
   (Gongbu natural reserve, GNR, and Yarlung zangbo river grand canyon
   natural reserve, YNR) and their surroundings in southeastern Tibet
   (outside of the natural reserves, ONR) using long-term satellite
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset. Linear regression
   and partial correlation analyses were constructed for the relationship
   between vegetation activity and climates to evaluate the distinct
   climate effects on the two natural reserves.
   Important Findings
   The two natural reserves were established at different time, which were
   related to anthropogenic activities impact durations. The results showed
   that the annual mean NDVI fluctuated between 0.5 and 0.6 in the
   relatively longer reserved YNR, which was remarkably higher than those
   in other regions (with NDVI lower than 0.45). The vegetation vigor in
   the YNR showed neither a significant temporal trend nor significant
   relationship with climate. Nevertheless, vegetation vigor exhibited a
   significant increasing trend during the last three decades
   (0.012/decade) at the GNR. The inter-decadal analysis turned out
   positive relationships between vegetation vigor and annual temperature
   since late 1990s until early 2000s when the GNR was officially
   established. This study underlined the importance of considering human
   interference duration when assessing the relationships between
   vegetation dynamics and climates.

AB In this chapter we synthesize our current understanding of projected
   climate change in the greater Himalayan region during the twenty-first
   century. This understanding has been constrained by the sparsity of
   climate observations and relatively greater limitations of our current
   modeling framework to represent the complex topographical influence of
   this vast high elevation region. Here, we examine studies that have
   analyzed global and regional climate model experiments for the greater
   Himalayan region to assess and quantify (a) future increases in
   temperature and how this warming trend varies with elevation, (b)
   climate feedbacks that amplify the warming in these high mountain
   regions, (c) changes in large-scale circulation that transport moisture
   and energy into the region, and (d) the implications from all of the
   above on the nature of precipitation, i.e., phase, amount and extremes,
   and the fate of its cryosphere. Wherever plausible, we compare these
   model projections with observations from recent decades to better
   constrain, as well as further improve, our understanding of the
   perceived hydroclimatic changes in this region during the twenty-first
   century.

AB Using dendrochronological techniques, this study examined whether
   tree-ring width of two evergreen broad-leaved species (Cleyera japonica,
   Eurya japonica) at their inland northern distribution limit in central
   Japan is more limited by low temperature compared with two co-dominating
   deciduous broad-leaved species (Fagus japonica, Magnolia hypoleuca) and
   two evergreen conifer species (Chamaecyparis obtusa, Abies firma), whose
   distribution limits are further north. The two deciduous broad-leaved
   species and the two evergreen conifers are tall tree species. Evergreen
   broad-leaved Cleyera japonica is a sub-canopy species and Eurya japonica
   is a small tree species. The tree-ring widths of four of the six species
   (except for Eurya japonica and Magnolia hypoleuca) correlated positively
   with the March temperature just before the start of the growth period.
   For deciduous broad-leaved Magnolia hypoleuca, the tree-ring width was
   correlated positively and negatively with July temperature and
   precipitation, respectively. However, the other deciduous broad-leaved
   Fagus japonica showed no such relationships. For the evergreen
   broad-leaved Cleyera japonica and evergreen conifers Chamaecyparis
   obtusa and Abies firma, tree-ring widths correlated positively with
   winter temperatures, probably because evergreen species can assimilate
   during warm winters. The tree-ring width of Cleyera japonica also
   correlated positively with temperatures of many months of the growth
   period. By contrast, the tree-ring width of the other evergreen
   broad-leaved Eurya japonica showed no positive correlation with the
   temperature in any month. Most Eurya japonica trees were suppressed by
   tall trees, which might disguise any climate effect. Thus, there were
   species differences in response to climate for each life form, and the
   tree-ring width of Cleyera japonica at the northern distribution limit
   was more limited by low temperatures compared with co-dominating
   species. It is suggested that growth of Cleyera japonica is increased by
   global warming at the latitudinal ecotone.

AB The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera,
   Curculionidae) is the most destructive pest of palm trees worldwide. RPW
   can potentially spread to all palm-growing areas in China, mainly
   ranging across much of South, East, and Southwest areas and causing
   severe economic loss. Here, we introduce the current distribution of RPW
   in China, discuss the invasive mechanisms, including thermal
   adaptability, host adaptability, immune response, and population genetic
   differentiation, and summarize the frequently-used prevention and
   control strategies in China, with chemical controls accompanied by
   trapping are the dominated measures. We aim to summarize research
   progress in the past several decades in RPW and to provide sound
   prospects for improving the strategies and tactics currently employed in
   ecologically-based pest management in China. In addition, further
   studies will carry out from two aspects of prevention and control,
   mainly focus on building the early observing and monitoring system,
   better elucidating invasive mechanisms, as well as developing the new
   techniques for pest management, such as genetic and behavior regulation,
   biological pesticides screening, and natural enemies release.

   population of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) are
   provided and compared with similar estimates for a population of

   of sticklebacks to compensate for variations in food availability by
   compensatory changes in food consumption. These changes allowed
   sticklebacks on fluctuating rations to maintain growth and reproductive
   performances comparable to sticklebacks receiving constant, daily
   rations. Such studies start to define the scope for compensation that
   buffers the effect of environmental variability in food supply.

AB Cell movement is a complex phenomenon primarily driven by the actin
   network beneath the cell membrane, and can be divided into three general
   components: protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the
   leading edge and deadhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal
   contraction to pull the cell forward. Each of these steps is driven by
   physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton. This
   review examines the specific physics underlying these phases of cell
   movement and the origins of the forces that drive locomotion.

AB Climate change is in part responsible for the 70% decline in amphibian
   species numbers worldwide. Although temperature is expected to impact
   whole-organism performance in ectotherms, reversible thermal acclimation
   has been suggested as a mechanism that may buffer responses to abrupt
   temperature changes. Here, we test for an effect of acclimation on
   locomotor performance traits (jump force and stamina) in adults of two
   predominantly aquatic and closely related frog species from different
   climatic regions, Xenopus tropicalis (tropical) and Xenopus laevis
   (temperate). We find significant effects of acclimation temperature on
   exertion capacity and for jump force in X. tropicalis but no effect of
   acclimation temperature on burst performance in X. laevis. Our results
   suggest that the two locomotor performance traits measured are
   differentially impacted by acclimation temperature in X. tropicalis. Our
   results further support the hypothesis that lower-latitude ectotherms
   might have greater acclimation capacity than high-latitude ones.
   Finally, our results highlight the importance of investigating multiple
   performance traits when evaluating how animals may cope with changes in
   temperature. Further work is required to evaluate the potential for
   acclimation in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on
   amphibian populations.

   evaluate body condition in juvenile female harbor seals (Phoca
   vitulina), (n=6) and adult female Steller sea lions (Eumetopias
   jubatus), (n=2). Surface temperature determined by IRT and blubber depth
   assessed with portable imaging ultrasound were monitored concurrently at
   eight body sites over the course of a year in long-term captive
   individuals under controlled conditions. Site-specific differences in
   surface temperature were noted between winter and summer in both
   species. Overall, surface temperature was slightly higher and more
   variable in harbor seals (9.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C) than Steller sea lions
   (9.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C). Limited site-specific relationships were found
   between surface temperature and blubber thickness, however, insulation
   level alone explained a very small portion of the variance. Therefore,
   while validated IRT data collection can potentially provide valuable
   information on the health, condition and metabolic state of an animal,
   it cannot provide a generalized proxy for blubber depth. (C) 2012

AB The southernmost extension of winter ice cover varies interannually and
   on longer time scales, reflecting large-scale changes in driving forces,
   especially in the position and intensity of the winter Aleutian Low
   Pressure System. A conspicuous pattern is alternating warm and cool
   periods of several years' duration. These variations in sea ice cover
   are reflected in the character of a subsurface cold pool, formed as
   stratification isolates the deeper cold waters from surface exchanges.
   The cold pool is better developed and more extensive in summers that
   follow deep southward penetration of winter sea ice. Interannual and
   decadal-scale variations in the distributions of some fish stocks
   reflect those of ice and thermal conditions. In particular, the
   distribution of walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, varies
   significantly with multiannual cool and warm years while Arctic cod,
   Boreogadus saida, is only present within the cold pool. The relation
   among climate variations, sea ice cover, subsurface thermal conditions,
   and fish distribution provides information on how climate affects marine
   ecosystems and may also have practical application in predicting fish
   distributions.

AB Species abundance distributions (SADs) have been the focus of many
   ecological studies. Understanding the causes of SAD patterns is a major
   stepping stone toward understanding of how ecological communities are
   organized. While SAD patterns have been well studied in marine
   environments and forests, knowledge of SADs in response to environmental
   or human-induced gradients is limited, especially in desert
   environments. In this study, we used structural equation modeling to
   analyze the effects of grazing disturbance and climate on plant SADs in
   a desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China, aiming to shed light on the
   assembly of plant communities in this region. We found both grazing
   disturbance and climate influenced SADs but through different pathways
   and with different magnitude. Grazing intensity affected SADs by
   reducing evenness and richness of common species, while increases in
   annual mean temperature and annual rainfall affected SADs by increasing
   richness of rare species. Climate had 30% greater effect on community
   structure than grazing disturbance, highlighting the role of climate in
   community assembly in desert environments where biological processes are
   highly constrained by water. We further found geometric series was
   associated with low annual rainfall and low richness, and log-normal
   with high annual rainfall, high richness and evenness. Geometric best
   fit for majority of the cases (60%) regardless of grazing intensity
   suggesting niche differentiation on the local scale is the principal
   community assembly process operating in the study region. Environmental
   filtering and niche differentiation may be concurrently operating to
   structure plant communities in this region.

AB Establishing natural climate variability becomes particularly important
   in remote polar regions, especially when considering questions regarding
   higher than average warming. We present a high-resolution record of
   temperature variability for the past 800 yr based on sedimentary diatoms
   from a treeline lake in Finnish Lapland. The BSiZer multiscale smoothing
   technique is applied to the data to identify significant features in the
   record at different temporal levels. The overall reconstruction shows
   relatively large multi-centennial temperature variability with a total
   range of about 0.6-0.8 degrees C. At millennial scales, the temperatures
   exhibit a statistically significant long-term cooling trend prior to
   industrialization (Delta T= -0.03 degrees C/century). At the centennial
   timescale, three warm time intervals were identified around AD 1200-1300
   (terminal phase of the Medieval Warm Period, MWP), 1380-1550 and from
   1920 until the present. Pronounced coolness occurred between AD 1600 and
   1920, indicative of the Little Ice Age (LIA). At the decadal level,
   certain shorter-term climate excursions were revealed. The warmest
   similar to 10-30 yr, non-overlapping periods occurred in AD 1220-1250,
   1470-1500 and 1970-2000, respectively. The classic events of MWP and LIA
   are evident in our record, as is also the 20th century warming. (c) 2006

AB Understanding of the effects of climatic change on phenological phases

   the period of 1981-2004 in northwest China and assessed the impacts of
   climatic changes on phenological phases and productivity of winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) and spring cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) at two
   locations. There was a clear trend of climate warming during the study
   period, leading to the earliness of pseudo stem elongation, booting,
   anthesis, and ripening stages of winter wheat by 13.2, 9,8, 11.0, and
   10.8 d during the 24-year period, respectively. The growth period from
   seedling emergence to stem elongation shortened 16.1 d, but the growth
   period from anthesis to milk prolonged 8.2 d during the 24-year period.
   In cotton, the dates of seedling emergence, budding, anthesis, and
   boll-opening stages became earlier by, respectively, 10.9, 9.0, 13.9,
   and 16.4 d during the period of 1983-2004. However, the growth periods
   from five-leaf stage to budding, budding to anthesis, and anthesis to
   boll-opening stages were prolonged by 2.4, 12.0, and 9.0 d,
   respectively, for every 1 degrees C of rise in minimum temperature
   during their respective growth period. Increasing minimum temperatures
   during the vegetative period positively affected winter wheat growth but
   increases in maximum temperatures during the reproductive period
   negatively affected kernel weight and grain yield. Consequently, the
   grain yield of winter wheat had decreased, but the yield of cotton had
   increased during the study period. The trend of climate warming appeared
   to be favourable for cotton production but unfavourable for winter wheat
   in northwest China. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly anisotropic microtubules (MTs) immersed in cytosol are a central
   part of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The dynamic behaviors of
   an MT-cytosol system are of major interest in biomechanics community.
   Such a solid-fluid system is characterized by a Reynolds number of the
   order 10(-3) and a slip ionic layer formed at the MT-cytosol interface.
   In view of these unique features, an orthotropic shell-Stokes flow model
   with a slip boundary condition has been developed to explore the
   distinctive dynamic behaviors of MTs in cytosol. Three types of motions
   have been identified, i.e., (a) undamped and damped torsional vibration,
   (b) damped longitudinal vibration, and (c) overdamped bending and radial
   motions. The exponentially decaying bending motion given by the present
   model is found to be in qualitative agreement with the existing

   measured at selected constant temperatures. Adult fundatrigenia produced
   an average of 16 nymphs per adult (range, 13.8-17.9 nymphs per adult).
   Reproductive capacity of adult alienicolae averaged 49.2 nymphs per
   adult (range, 17.4-75.22 nymphs per adult). Reproductive rate of
   fundatrigenia was more responsive to temperature, but reproductive
   capacity was less sensitive to temperature compared with alienicolae.
   Development of alienicolae was investigated at 7 constant temperatures
   ranging from 10 to 29.2 degrees C. Alienicolae development was fitted to
   a nonlinear, temperature-dependent model. In addition, degree-day
   requirements for development and the lower developmental threshold of
   alienicolae were estimated with n-weighted linear regression for
   comparison with reported lower developmental thresholds of other aphids.
   The lower developmental threshold estimate for P. populitransversus fell
   within the range of lower developmental thresholds for other aphids.
   Development time from birth to adult was similar to Pemphigus betae
   Doane, but longer than development times reported for some
   foliar-feeding aphids.

   northward range expansion of the marine neogastropod Kelletia kelletii
   (Forbes, 1852).
   Location This is a marine coastal shelf neogastropod species whose range
   extends from Isla Asuncion (Baja California, Mexico) to Monterey (CA,
   USA). Research sites spanned the extent of the range.
   Methods We examine abundance distributions and size frequency
   distributions of K. kelletii for evidence of factors determining
   historic and contemporary distributional patterns. Population studies
   were supplemented by historic and contemporary hydrographic data,
   including seawater temperature data from California Cooperative Oceanic
   Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI ) and National Data Buoy Center
   (NDBC), and seawater circulation data.
   Results The structure of recently established populations varied
   dramatically from that of historic populations. Markedly low densities
   and irregular size frequency distributions characterized recently
   established populations and suggested only occasionally successful
   recruitment. The point of transition between historic and recently
   established populations also corresponded to the location of a gradient
   in seawater temperature and the confluence of two major oceanic
   currents. The accumulated data suggest that temperature and/or barriers
   to dispersal could have set both contemporary patterns in population
   structure as well as the former northern range limit.
   Main conclusion Early life stages play a critical role in determining
   distributional patterns of K. kelletii . Dispersal barriers and
   temperature limitation are two plausible mechanisms that could determine
   both contemporary and historic distributional patterns. Future studies
   on this species should attempt to tease apart the relative importance of
   these factors in maintaining the populations at the northern edge of the
   range.

AB Population-based threshold models using hydrothermal time (HTT) have
   been widely used to model seed germination. We used HTT to model
   conidial germination and mycelial growth for the seed pathogen
   Pyrenophora semeniperda in a novel approach to understanding its
   interactions with host seeds. Germination time courses and mycelial
   growth rates for P.semeniperda were measured on PDA amended to achieve a
   series of five water potentials (ca. 0 to -6 MPa) at six constant
   temperatures (5-30 degrees C). Conidial germination was described with
   alternative population-based models using constant or variable base and
   maximum temperature and water potential parameters. Mycelial growth was
   modeled as a continuous, linear process with constant base temperature
   and base water potential. Models based on HTT showed reasonable fit to
   germination and growth rate data sets. The best-fit conidial germination
   model (R-2 = 0.859) was based on variable base and maximum temperature
   as a function of water potential. The good fit of the linear mycelial
   growth model (R-2 = 0.916) demonstrated the utility of HTT for modeling
   continuous as well as population-based processes. HTT modeling may be a
   useful approach to the quantification of germination and growth
   processes in a wide range of filamentous fungi. Published by Elsevier

TI Population connectivity in a highly migratory fish, Japanese Spanish

AB Connectivity is a vital component of metapopulation and fishery ecology,
   influencing fundamental processes such as population dynamics,
   evolution, and community responses to climate change. The Japanese
   Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus niphonius, is an economically important
   species in the temperate and subtropical waters of the Northwestern
   Pacific Ocean, especially in the China seas. As a highly migratory
   species, the population connectivity of S. niphonius is not only limited
   to dispersal in the pelagic larval stage but throughout the whole life
   history, and then determines the natal origin and population structure.
   However, knowledge about population connectivity is scarce and, at
   present, is no formal management strategy to ensure the long-term
   sustainability of the S. niphonius fishery in China. In this study,
   otolith chemistry was applied to investigate the connectivity among four
   spawning grounds along a latitudinal gradient spanning much of the known
   species range in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea [Qingdao (QD),
   Lvsi (LS), Xiangshan (XS) and Fuzhou (FZ)]. Otoliths from age-1 spawning
   or spent individuals were analyzed from the core to the margin by using
   laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).
   In each sampled life stage, otolith elements are similar among fish from
   different spawning grounds, but otolith chemical compositions vary
   greatly between life stages. Decreasing Ba:Ca ratio indicates
   ontogenetic migrations from relatively shallow coastal water during
   larval growth to relatively deep offshore waters with increasing age.
   The random forest classification and non metric multi-dimensional
   scaling show a strong overlap in otolith elemental composition. The
   hereby results indicate a large-scale connectivity in the life history
   of S. niphonius: the immature fish mix to a large extent when they feed
   and overwinter in the extensive offshore waters; adults spawned in the
   same spawning ground have multiple natal origins and fish caught off QD
   may even be of FZ origin. Clustering of near core chemistry pointed to
   three sources, with southern grounds dominated by a single cluster while
   northern grounds dominated by two or three clusters. From these results,
   it was suggested that the local mackerel assemblages on which fisheries
   rely in the Yellow Sea are collectively influenced by the recruitment of
   all the spawning assemblages along China coastal waters instead of
   self-sustaining.

AB Background and Aims Two previous papers in this series evaluated model
   fit of eight thermal-germination models parameterized from
   constant-temperature germination data. The previous studies determined
   that model formulations with the fewest shape assumptions provided the
   best estimates of both germination rate and germination time. The
   purpose of this latest study was to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency
   of these same models in predicting germination time and relative seedlot
   performance under field-variable temperature scenarios.
   Methods The seeds of four rangeland grass species were germinated under
   104 variable-temperature treatments simulating six planting dates at
   three field sites in south-western Idaho. Measured and estimated
   germination times for all subpopulations were compared for all models,
   species and temperature treatments.
   Key Results All models showed similar, and relatively high, predictive
   accuracy for field-temperature simulations except for the
   iterative-probit-optimization (IPO) model, which exhibited systematic
   errors as a function of subpopulation. Highest efficiency was obtained
   with the statistical-gridding (SG) model, which could be directly
   parameterized by measured subpopulation rate data. Relative seedlot
   response predicted by thermal time coefficients was somewhat different
   from that estimated from mean field-variable temperature response as a
   function of subpopulation.
   Conclusions All germination response models tested performed relatively
   well in estimating field-variable temperature response. IPO caused
   systematic errors in predictions of germination time, and may have
   degraded the physiological relevance of resultant cardinal-temperature
   parameters. Comparative indices based on expected field performance may
   be more ecologically relevant than indices derived from a broader range
   of potential thermal conditions.

AB Most demographic studies focus on numerical changes that occur within
   populations across years. However, typically studies at an interannual
   scale do not provide information on the particular times of the year
   (particular months or seasons) when rates of survival, recruitment, or
   migration increase or decrease due to physiological, behavioral or
   ecological processes. These monthly or seasonal changes in demographic
   parameters may lead to substantial variations in population abundance.
   In this study, we collected capture-mark-recapture data on 3 species of
   lizards of the genus Sceloporus (Sceloporus torquatus, Sceloporus
   grammicus and Sceloporus megalepidurus) found in ecologically similar
   habitats to examine potential changes in demographic rates among 3
   different climatic seasons: rainy, cold-dry and warm-dry seasons. We
   tested different hypotheses about the effect of these seasons on
   survival, recruitment of new adults, and temporary emigration. We found
   that during the season with severe thermal constraints, the cold-dry
   season, survival of S. torquatus decreased markedly. We also detected a
   considerable increase in the recruitment rate of S. grammicus during the
   rainy season, when these lizards are establishing territories and
   finding mates. In contrast, we found no evidence of intra-annual changes
   in the rate of temporary emigration. In addition, we calculated
   abundance and population growth rates for each species and for each
   season. Our study represents a significant contribution to the
   understanding of intra-annual demographic variation in lizards.

AB In this study, results are presented concerning the population dynamics
   of the meiobenthic copepod Nannopus palustris in the oligo-mesohaline
   area of the Gironde estuary, France. Samples were taken weekly during
   one year (April 1992 to April 1993). Stage-specific birth and mortality
   rates were calculated using the Argentesi model. Clutch size, percentage
   of ovigerous females and sex ratio of the Nannopus palustris population
   showed clear seasonal variations strongly related to temperature. Other
   factors like salinity or chlorophyll-a were also significantly related
   to these population parameters. The development time field data obtained
   for Nannopus palustris was also significantly related to temperature.
   Fecundity, or egg production rate, and instantaneous birth rate showed
   strong variations throughout the year. In this study specific mortality
   rates for nauplius, copepodite and adult animals were estimated for the
   first time for a benthic harpacticoid. All models indicate that the
   nauplius stage suffers higher mortality as compared to copepodite stages
   or adults. Waves or peaks of mortality were detected for all stages and
   were probably related to the moulting process associated to the
   progression of different abundance pulses. All results indicate that the
   population increase is not food limited during the year, being mainly
   temperature controlled.

AB The present study set out to investigate the thermal limits of the
   Mediterranean bivalve Modiolus barbatus, acclimated to various
   temperatures, and includes a comparison of laboratory determined limits
   with its temperature-dependent restriction to deeper water layers in its
   natural habitat. Thermal responses and limits were determined by
   integrating information from various levels of biological organization,
   including the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, the phosphorylation of
   stress-activated protein kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (p38 MAPK) and cJun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) as well as metabolic
   adjustments. The latter were assessed by examining temperature effects
   on the activity of the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). The
   expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 was activated when mussels were acclimated
   to temperatures above 20 degrees C. Increased phosphorylation of p38
   MAPK and JNKs at about the same temperatures indicate activation of MAPK
   signaling cascades and their potential involvement in the induction of
   Hsp genes. As indicated by the activity of PK, Modiolus barbatus
   maintains some aerobic capacity when acclimated to temperatures up to 24
   degrees C, while further warming probably caused metabolic depression
   and a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. An increase in
   mortality occurred in parallel, during acclimation to temperatures above
   24 degrees C. Our results indicate that both the biochemical stress
   indicators and metabolic status respond in parallel once hypoxemia
   becomes extreme. Comparison with our previous study of thermal limits
   and vertical distribution in M. galloprovincialis dwelling in shallow
   waters emphasizes the relevance of maintained aerobic scope over that of
   passive tolerance for permanent vertical zonation at higher temperatures
   in the field. These findings and conclusions are in line with the
   concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance and the
   associated systemic to molecular hierarchy of thermal limitation.

AB Several studies have indicated that in birds breathing frequency (f,
   breaths min<SU-1</SU) scales to the -1/3 of body weight (W, kg); this is
   different from the -1/4 of mammals. We wondered if this discrepancy was
   due to the peculiar scaling pattern of aquatic birds, as is the case of
   aquatic mammals. In fact, we had noted previously that the allometric
   scaling of f differs considerably between aquatic and terrestrial
   mammals, respectively, W<SU-0.42</SU and W<SU-0.25</SU. Measurements of
   f were obtained in 48 aquatic birds of 22 species and in 35 terrestrial
   birds of 27 species, during resting conditions on land. Additional data
   from 11 aquatic and 14 terrestrial species, different from the ones
   measured, were obtained from the literature. The allometric curve of all
   species combined (terrestrial and aquatic, n=74) was
   f=13.3W<SU-0.36</SU, similar to what is reported in previous studies.
   However, the allometric curve of the aquatic species (n=33,
   f=14.5W<SU-0.56</SU) differed greatly (P < 0.001) from that of the
   terrestrial species (n=41, f=13.4W<SU-0.26</SU). On average, f of
   aquatic birds of the 3-5 kg range was 63%, and that of birds of larger
   size was 57%, of the values of terrestrial birds of similar W. We
   conclude that, as in mammals, also in terrestrial birds f scales to the
   -1/4 exponent of W. The similarity of the scaling patterns of f between
   aquatic birds and mammals suggests a common breathing adaptation to life
   in the aquatic environment irrespective of phylogenetic relations.

AB Dry heat microbial reduction is the NASA-approved sterilization method
   to reduce the microbial bioburden on spaceflight hardware for missions
   with planetary protection requirements. The method involves heating the
   spaceflight hardware to temperatures between 104 degrees C and 125
   degrees C for up to 50 hours, while controlling the humidity to very low
   values. Collection of lethality data at temperatures above 125 degrees C
   and with ambient ( uncontrolled) humidity conditions would establish
   whether any microbial reduction credit can be offered to the flight
   project for processes that occur at temperatures greater than 125
   degrees C. The goal of this research is to determine the survival rates
   of Bacillus atrophaeus ( ATCC 9372) spores subjected to temperatures
   higher than 125 degrees C under both dry (controlled) and room ambient
   humidity (36-66% relative humidity) conditions. Spores were deposited
   inside thin, stainless steel thermal spore exposure vessels (TSEVs) and
   heated under ambient or controlled humidity conditions from 115 degrees
   C to 170 degrees C. After the exposures, the TSEVs were cooled rapidly,
   and the spores were recovered and plated. Survivor ratios, lethality
   rate constants, and D-values were calculated at each temperature. At 115
   degrees C and 125 degrees C, the controlled humidity lethality rate
   constant was faster than the ambient humidity lethality rate constant.
   At 135 degrees C, the ambient and controlled humidity lethality rate
   constants were statistically identical. At 150 degrees C and 170 degrees
   C, the ambient humidity lethality rate constant was slightly faster than
   the controlled humidity lethality rate constant. These results provide
   evidence for possibly modifying the NASA dry heat microbial reduction
   specification.

   adult glycogen content. We find a twofold difference in activity, among
   PGM protein haplotypes that is associated with a threefold difference in
   glycogen content. The latitudinal clines for several Pgm amino acid
   polymorphisms show that high PGM activity, and apparently higher flux to
   glycogen synthesis, parallel the low activity clines at G6PD for reduced

AB During four summer seasons mesozooplankton community composition and
   structure in relation to water mass distribution were investigated along
   a 735-km transect running across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)
   to the north-west of the island of South Georgia, Southern Ocean.
   Samples were obtained each year during December-January from the top 200
   m of the water column at 22 stations spaced 35 km apart. Cluster
   analysis revealed four station groupings that were geographically
   consistent with the different water masses identified on the basis of
   temperature and salinity properties along the transect. A Sub-Antarctic
   Zone (SAZ) community characterised by low overall plankton abundance was
   present at the northernmost end of the transect on three of the four
   cruises, separated from a Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) community by the
   Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF). The PFZ community lay between the SAF and the
   Polar Front (PF) and was characterised by highest overall abundance and
   little interannual variability. Two Antarctic Zone (AAZ) communities
   were found south of the PF that, although taxonomically similar,
   differed in overall abundance. Although there were significant
   differences in nutrients (e.g. silicate) and phytoplankton (Chl a)
   between the different water masses, these factors only weakly correlated
   with plankton community structure. Copepods were the largest
   contributors to total abundance within all station groupings (median
   percentage 83-90% of total) and pteropods were also proportionately
   abundant in the PFZ (11%). With the exception of pteropods (less than or
   equal to11%) and ostracods (less than or equal to3%) all other
   non-copepod taxa contributed <1% to total abundance. All station groups
   were characterised by varying proportions of a relatively small subset
   of species, many of which were present throughout the transect, for
   example, Oithona similis, Ctenocalanus spp., Euchaeta antarctica, and
   Rhincalanus gigas. Others were particularly characteristic of different
   station groups, thus Neocalanus tonsus, Clausocalanus ingens, and
   Calocalanus spp. were characteristic of the SAZ with few in the PFZ and
   none in the AAZ. Microcalanus pygmaeus was particularly abundant in the
   AAZ compared to other regions, as was the polychaete, Pelagobia
   longicirrata. Other taxa, although widespread, tended to be typical of
   particular water masses, for example, Calanus simillimus and Limacina
   helicina in the PFZ, Calanoides acutus, appendicularians and P.
   longicirrata in the AAZ, and ostracods and chaetognaths in the SAZ. The
   close physical and biological coupling observed across the ACC confirms
   the frontal zones and particularly the PF as features across which
   community properties change in the Atlantic sector of the Southern
   Ocean.

AB The usual method of restoring cut-over bogs is to rewet the peat
   surface. but this often leads to the remaining peat layers being deeply
   inundated. For Sphagnum-dominated vegetation to develop at deeply
   inundated locations. it is important for floating rafts of buoyant
   residual peat to develop. In this study. the chemical and physical
   characteristics of buoyant and inundated peat collected from rewetted
   cut-over bog were compared. In general. buoyant peat was poorly
   humified: high methane (CH4) production rates (greater than or equal to2
   mumol g(-1) DW day(-1)) were important to ensure buoyancy. Although the
   peat water CH4 concentrations increased with depth. the CH4 production
   rates were higher in the uppermost peat layers. High CH4 production
   rates were related positively with P concentrations and negatively with
   lignin concentrations. The pH to bulk density ratio (greater than or
   equal to0.05) also appeared to be a good indicator of CH4 production
   rates, providing an easy and cheap way to measure. the variable for
   restoration practitioners. Our results indicated that analysing certain
   simple characteristics of the residual peat can greatly improve the
   success of the rewetting measures taken in cut-over bogs. If the
   analysis reveals that the residual peat is unsuitable for floating raft
   formation, deep inundation is inappropriate unless suitable peat from
   other locations can be introduced.

   reconstructed. res from 9245. re scars on 576 trees ( mostly ponderosa
   pine, Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) at 21 sites and compared them to
   existing tree-ring reconstructions of climate ( temperature and the
   Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]) and large-scale climate patterns
   that affect modern spring climate in this region ( El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation [ENSO] and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]). We
   identified 32 regional-fire years as those with five or more sites with.
   re. Fires were remarkably widespread during such years, including one
   year ( 1748) in which. res were recorded at 10 sites across what are
   today seven national forests plus one site on state land. During
   regional-fire years, spring - summers were significantly warm and
   summers were significantly warm-dry whereas the opposite conditions
   prevailed during the 99 years when no. res were recorded at any of our
   sites (no-fire years). Climate in prior years was not significantly
   associated with regional-or no-fire years. Years when. re was recorded
   at only a few of our sites occurred under a broad range of climate
   conditions, highlighting the fact that the regional climate drivers of.
   re are most evident when. res are synchronized across a large area.
   No-fire years tended to occur during La Nina years, which tend to have
   anomalously deep snowpacks in this region. However, ENSO was not a
   significant driver of regional-fire years, consistent with the greater
   influence of La Nina than El Nino conditions on the spring climate of
   this region. PDO was not a significant driver of past. re, despite being
   a strong driver of modern spring climate and modern regional-fire years
   in the northern Rockies.

AB Habitat disturbance is one of the main factors contributing to
   population declines. Changes in the amount and quality of available
   habitat can affect body condition and morphology. In this study we
   evaluated the effect of habitat disturbance (deforestation, urbanisation
   and land-use change) on body size, body condition and fluctuating
   asymmetry in two species of arboreal tropical frogs (Agalychnis
   callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus) at Los Tuxtlas Biosphere
   Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico. We did not find significant differences in
   body condition or body size associated with habitat disturbance in A.
   callidryas, although the species reduced its local distribution in line
   with habitat disturbance. In D. ebraccatus, on the other hand, we
   observed a significant relationship between body condition and size with
   habitat disturbance. It is unknown whether these changes are adaptive or
   compromise the permanence of populations. Fluctuating asymmetry indices
   for both species exhibited no significant differences except for the
   tibia-fibula length of D. ebraccatus, which was significantly higher in
   undisturbed habitat.

AB The predator-prey relationship is a strong agent of natural selection on
   phenotype, and two evolutionary strategies derived from this
   antagonistic interaction are crypsis and aposematism. Although usually
   considered as opposites, both strategies could be ascribed to the dark
   zigzag pattern of European vipers (Vipera). Experiments using plasticine
   models demonstrated its aposematic role, and no evidence had been found
   regarding a possible cryptic function. We examined the possibility of a
   cryptic role by measuring five characters related to the zigzag size and
   shape in 465 Vipera latastei specimens from the Iberian Peninsula to
   assess geographic variation in these characters. This species shows
   genetic substructuring resulting from population isolation and occurs in
   strong environmental gradients, which allows testing whether historic
   and/or environmental (adaptive) factors explain this variation. Spatial
   interpolation of zigzag characters identified two major Iberian groups:
   the Western and the Eastern. The Western group was characterised by a
   larger zigzag extension and higher number of dorsal marks; specimens
   within this group were in granitic grounds and areas with higher
   rainfall and lower solar radiation than those of the Eastern group. The
   correlation of the zigzag shape and size with lithology and climatic
   variables suggested that dorsal pattern variation is driven by: (1) its
   cryptic role, as detectability might be influenced by the degree of
   contrast between the target and background lithology, or (2) its thermal
   role, as the larger zigzag may allow for faster heating in Western
   Iberian regions with limited thermal opportunities. A log-linear
   analysis using dorsal pattern groups, genetic lineages and lithological
   classes, showed significant interactions among the three variables.
   These results suggest that dorsal pattern variation of V. latastei
   resulted from genetic (i.e. historic) as well as environmental (i.e.
   adaptive) factors, first by population isolation in geographic refuges
   and further by local adaptation to particular environments.

AB This paper explores the historical relationship between weather
   fluctuations and mortality evolution in China. Using panel data on the
   annual provincial mortality rate and daily weather variables for the
   1964-2008 period, we applied a dynamic model structure with sufficient
   controls to estimate the short-term effects of temperature shocks on
   China's mortality rate. Our main results show that an additional 1
   degrees C rise in average temperature in a given year increases the
   annual mortality rate by an average of 3.2%. In addition, days with
   daily average temperatures exceeding 27 degrees C (30 degrees C) are
   associated with an increase in the annual mortality rate of nearly 0.1%
   (0.2%) or approximately 9,520 (19,040) additional deaths. In contrast,
   extremely cold days do not have these effects. By applying a hybrid
   model structure (the long difference approach) to examine the
   medium-term effects of temperature changes, we find that there is little
   evidence of overall adaptation to high temperatures when moving from the
   short term to the medium term. In addition, by introducing interactions
   between temperatures and potential modifiers such as access to doctors,
   hospital beds, air conditioning and refrigerators, we determined that
   only residential air conditioning played an important role in mitigating
   the temperature-mortality relationship. However, the penetration of air
   conditioning in China is still relatively low. These findings indicate
   that climate change could partially explain the historical phenomenon of
   China's rising mortality rate during the unprecedented economic boom
   experienced since the 1980s.

AB Phytoplankton species composition is strongly affected by seasons, which
   should be taken into account in palaeolimnological studies. Although
   chrysophyte cysts and diatoms are widely used as palaeobioindicators in
   palaeolimnological studies, only recently have attempts been made to use
   their modern deposition from sediment trap data to provide more
   detailed, seasonal-based environmental reconstructions. In this study
   sediment traps were used to record seasonality of chrysophyte cysts and
   diatoms during two climatically different years 2009 and 2010 in an
   annually laminated Lake Nautajarvi, Finland, and this seasonal data was
   then compared with the fossil record derived from the surface sediment
   of the lake. The overall changes in cyst and diatom assemblages between
   years and seasons are subtle. For both groups, no clear connection to
   any particular season could be detected in the sediment surface. Despite
   the climatological differences between the study years, the inter-annual
   accumulation rates of both algal groups were surprisingly similar,
   whereas the intra-annual accumulation rates differed substantially. This
   and the high amount of taxa occurring during all seasons in the trap
   samples implies that primary producers are more dependent on prevailing
   seasonal limnological conditions than on rapid, shortly lived episodes.
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that chrysophyte cyst assemblages
   from the spring sediment trap are mainly controlled by the spring
   discharge intensity, a surrogate variable of spring weather conditions,
   whereas precipitation and air temperature have the strongest impact on
   the summer assemblages. However, only discharge explains statistically
   significantly the variance in the cyst data. Precipitation and air
   temperature have the strongest impact on the diatom summer samples,
   whereas the spring sediment trap sample of the snowy and harsh winter of
   2010 was strongly correlated with the spring discharge. However, none of
   the measured environmental variables explains the variance in the diatom
   data statistically significantly. The similarity between the algae found
   in the sediment traps and surface sediment sample suggests that within
   small and shallow lakes without any extreme environmental settings the
   surface sediment sample represents well the lake's overall algal
   composition and can thus be used in palaeolimnological studies.

AB The challenge Understanding how biotic interactions affect species'
   geographical ranges, biodiversity patterns and ecological responses to
   environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges in
   macroecology. Extensive efforts are underway to detect signals of biotic
   interactions in macroecological data. However, efforts are limited by
   bias in the taxa and spatial scale for which occurrence data are
   available and by difficulty in ascribing causality to co-occurrence
   patterns. Moreover, we are not necessarily looking in the right places;
   analyses are largely ad hoc, depending on availability of data, rather
   than focusing on regions, taxa, ecosystems or interaction types where
   biotic interactions might affect species' geographical ranges most
   strongly. Unpicking biotic interactions We suggest that macroecology
   would benefit from the recognition that abiotic conditions alter two key
   components of biotic interaction strength: frequency and intensity. We
   outline how and why variation in biotic interaction strength occurs,
   explore the implications for species' geographical ranges and discuss
   the challenges inherent in quantifying these effects. In addition, we
   explore the role of behavioural flexibility in mediating biotic
   interactions potentially to mitigate impacts of environmental change.
   New data We argue that macroecology should take advantage of
   "independent" data on the strength of biotic interactions measured by
   other disciplines, in order to capture a far wider array of taxa,
   locations and interaction types than are typically studied in
   macroecology. Data on biotic interactions are readily available from
   community, disease, microbial and parasite ecology, evolution,
   palaeontology, invasion biology and agriculture, but most are yet to be
   exploited within macroecology. Integrating biotic interaction strength
   data into macroecology Harmonization of data across interdisciplinary
   sources, taxa and interaction types could be achieved by breaking down
   interactions into elements that contribute to frequency and intensity.
   This would allow quantitative biotic interaction data to be incorporated
   directly into models of species distributions and macroecological
   patterns.

AB This article evaluates the influence of gender on diumal and postlunch
   period variations in subjective activation and mood. This topic is not
   often addressed in the literature; particularly, little attention has
   been paid to how biological rhythms might bias research results. We
   studied 40 university student volunteers (20 men, 20 women) aged 18 to
   23 years old (X = 20.23, SD = 1.03); they responded to questions on
   eight unipolar visual analog scales every hour from 08:00 to 21:00.
   Gender differences were observed in both diurnal and postlunch
   variations for scales of positive activation (alertness, vigor);
   sleepiness, however, was only sensitive to diurnal variation, and
   weariness was sensitive only to a postlunch effect. Women displayed a
   morning-type pattern, with their optimal moment (11:00) coming 2h
   earlier than for men, and their activation ratings ranged more widely.
   The only mood scale that showed differences related to gender was that
   of happiness, for which women had a higher diumal mean, a diurnal peak
   2h earlier, and a less-intense postlunch effect. Endogenous control of
   rhythmic pattern appears to be less intense in women, probably due to
   the coexistence of circamensual rhythmicity, although environmental or
   sociocultural influences may play a modulating role. Chronopsychological
   gender differences in affective states should be studied further given
   the implication they have for the prevention and treatment of mood
   disorders.

AB The abilities of cold-hardy plants to resist deacclimation during
   transient warm spells and to reacclimate when cold temperatures return
   are significant for winter survival. Yet compared to the volume of
   research on the biology of cold acclimation, relatively little is known
   about how plants maintain and/or reacquire cold hardiness in late winter
   and spring. This review summarizes the past 40 years of research into
   deacclimation and reacclimation in herbaceous and woody plants and
   suggests questions that should be addressed with multi-disciplinary
   approaches to more comprehensively understand the biology of
   winter-survival in plants. Deacclimation and reacclimation are highly
   dependent on exogenous and endogenous factors such as the ambient
   temperatures, water availability, photoperiod, energy budget and
   metabolism, growth and development, and the dormancy status of plants.
   Putative mechanisms of these hardiness transitions are discussed based
   on the published accounts of changes in carbohydrates (e.g., compatible
   solutes), membrane lipids, proteins (e.g., dehydrins), antioxidants,
   photosynthesis, and gene expression. In conclusion, the relationships
   between environmental determinants, gene expression and regulation,
   cellular and organismal structure and function, and the consequent cold
   hardiness transitions in plants are discussed and debated. (c) 2006

AB Coastal Patagonia, often regarded as a pristine area of the world, has
   been invaded by non-indigenous species that are rapidly modifying local
   ecosystems. One of the most conspicuous invaders is the kelp Undaria
   pinnatifida. First recorded near the city of Puerto Madryn (Argentina,
   42.75 degrees S) in 1992, Undaria's range has expanded more than five
   degrees of latitude to the south during the last 15 years. By 2007 it
   was first detected north of Valdes Peninsula (a natural barrier to
   dispersal), beginning its northward expansion, and between 2007 and 2011
   spread along the coasts of San Jose and San Matias gulfs at an average
   rate of similar to 50 km yr(-1). A small population was detected in Mar
   del Plata (Argentina, 38.04 degrees S) in 2011, more than three degrees
   of latitude to the north, suggesting a new human-mediated inoculation. A
   thermal tolerance window is hypothesized based on experimental
   information and remotely sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) at the
   latitudinal range limits of U. pinnatifida populations worldwide. The
   window is defined by average SSTs ranging between -0.6 degrees C and
   16.8 degrees C in the coldest month, and between 13 degrees C and 28
   degrees C in the warmest month. Using climatologic satellite SST from
   several locations, a potential latitudinal thermal range extending
   between Puerto Deseado (Argentina, 47.75 degrees S) and Cape Torres
   (Brazil; 29.35 degrees S) is predicted. Salinity and substrate quality
   however constrain suitable habitat in the Southwest Atlantic to discrete
   stretches of coastline, suggesting that the northern potential boundary
   would be around La Coronilla (33.90 degrees S), on the Uruguayan coast.

AB Each plant species has particular requirements for seed germination, and
   some of them respond differently to constant or alternating temperature
   regimes. In this study, the interchangeable effects of different
   treatments and temperatures on the completion of seed germination of
   Clematis vitalba L. were investigated. The seeds were tested with a
   constant (from 5 degrees C to 25 degrees C) or a fluctuating (25/10
   degrees C) temperature regime, and the effect of gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)), incubation at warm (W) or cold (C) temperatures while being
   imbibed, and drying after ripening (DAR) were evaluated. The final
   germination percentages and the time in days required to reach 50% of
   germination (T-50) were calculated. GA(3) and C significantly enhanced
   completion of seed germination at all of the temperatures tested. A
   strong positive effect of alternating temperature was observed, which
   triggered completion of seed germination regardless of treatment. Under
   the fluctuating temperature, the chilled seeds had the most rapid
   germination. Low germination rates were observed for both control and
   DAR treatments. Seeds of C. vitalba display a certain degree of
   dormancy, which can be broken by moist chilling and GA(3) treatments.
   Moreover, alternating temperature stimulates the completion of seed
   germination by satisfying certain physiological requirements for
   germination under constant temperatures.

AB Chromosomal inversions are present in a wide range of animals and
   plants, having an important role in adaptation and speciation. Although
   empirical evidence of their adaptive value is abundant, the role of
   different processes underlying evolution of chromosomal polymorphisms is
   not fully understood. History and selection are likely to shape
   inversion polymorphism variation to an extent yet largely unknown. Here,
   we perform a real-time evolution study addressing the role of historical
   constraints and selection in the evolution of these polymorphisms. We
   founded laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura derived from
   three locations along the European cline and followed the evolutionary
   dynamics of inversion polymorphisms throughout the first 40 generations.
   At the beginning, populations were highly differentiated and remained so
   throughout generations. We report evidence of positive selection for
   some inversions, variable between foundations. Signs of negative
   selection were more frequent, in particular for most cold-climate
   standard inversions across the three foundations. We found that
   previously observed convergence at the phenotypic level in these
   populations was not associated with convergence in inversion
   frequencies. In conclusion, our study shows that selection has shaped
   the evolutionary dynamics of inversion frequencies, but doing so within
   the constraints imposed by previous history. Both history and selection
   are therefore fundamental to predict the evolutionary potential of
   different populations to respond to global environmental changes.

AB A survey of chironomid subfossil remains was carried out in Lough
   Muckno, a lake system located in northeast Ireland. The dataset provides
   new insights into chironomid ecology and subfossil taphonomy in the
   Irish Ecoregion. A significant degree of homogeneity in subfossil
   assemblages and presence of efficient offshore redeposition mechanisms
   was evident. The potential role of the thermocline and river discharge
   in determining subfossil assemblage composition was also explored.
   Redundancy analysis indicated that sample (spatial) location and water
   depth are governing and intertwined controls on chironomid assemblage
   composition. Profundal habitats at a sensible distance from the littoral
   best integrated basin-wide remains representing suitable locations for
   paleoecological reconstructions based on a single-core approach.
   However, assemblages in deep mid-lake habitats characterized by advanced
   diagenesis and low head capsule counts were deemed unsuitable for
   paleoecological applications. The results highlight the importance of
   accounting for both lake depth and distance metrics in the design of
   paleolimnological investigations in systems with a complex basin
   morphology.

AB On the South Indian Ocean Province Islands of the sub-Antarctic, most
   nutrients are processed through a detritus-based food web. On Marion
   Island, larvae of the moth Pringleophaga marioni are one of the key
   decomposers. Abundance of these caterpillars is higher in newly
   abandoned Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) nests than other
   habitats, and this observation has been explained by hypotheses
   regarding the thermal and nutrient advantages of nests. These hypotheses
   require a mechanism for increasing the abundance of caterpillars, since
   nests are an ephemeral resource, and here, we determine whether
   caterpillars respond to chemosensory and thermal cues using a laboratory
   choice chamber approach. Caterpillars show no significant preference for
   newly abandoned nest material over no other choice, old nest material,
   and the common mire moss Sanionia uncinata. Caterpillars that are
   acclimated to warm (15 A degrees C) conditions do prefer lower (5 A
   degrees C) to higher (15 A degrees C) temperatures, perhaps reflecting
   negative effects of prolonged exposure to warm temperatures on growth.
   Caterpillars also show significant avoidance of conspecifics, possibly
   because of incidental cannibalism previously reported in this species.
   Thus, we find no empirical support for nest-finding ability in
   caterpillars based on chemosensory or thermal cues. It is possible that
   adult females or very early instar caterpillars show such ability, or
   high caterpillar density and biomass in nests are an incidental
   consequence of better conditions in the nests or deposition by the birds
   during nest construction.

AB A process of comparative pattern recognition is undertaken for the
   purpose of garnering insights into the mechanisms underlying some
   currently puzzling conundrums in fishery resource ecology. These include
   ( a) out-of-phase oscillations between anchovies and sardines, (b) the
   remarkable fish productivity of the Peru - Humboldt marine ecosystem, (
   c) sardine population increases in the eastern Pacific during El Ninos,
   ( d) basin-wide synchronies in large-amplitude abundance variations, (
   e) characteristic spawning of large tuna species in poorly productive
   areas, (f) contrary trends in Pacific tropical tuna abundance during the
   1970s and early 1980s. It is found that each of the items appears to
   become less enigmatic when the conceptual focus shifts from conventional
   trophodynamics to the idea that 'loopholes' in the fields of biological
   controls (i.e. of predators of early life stages), produced by poor
   ocean productivity or by disruptive environmental perturbations, may in
   fact lead to remarkable reproductive success. Implications include the
   following: ( 1) El Nino, rather than being an unmitigated disaster for
   Peruvian fisheries, may in the long run be a prime reason for the
   remarkable fishery productivity of the Peru - Humboldt large marine
   ecosystem. ( 2) Globally-teleconnected climatic trends or shifts might
   produce globally-coherent population expansions even when local
   environmental expressions may be quite different. ( 3) It may be
   unreasonable to expect any management methodologies to be able to keep
   the fish populations of highly climatically-perturbed systems such as
   the Peruvian LME always at stable high levels; an alternative approach,
   for example, might be to take optimal advantage of the transient
   opportunities afforded by the high fish productivity of such inherently
   erratic systems.

AB A drastic population change in Japanese sardine (Sardinops
   melanostictus) has been noted as being related to winter sea surface
   temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio Extension region. The former studies
   suggest two possible explanations. One is that temperature itself
   affects sardine. The other is that SST represents the environmental
   change of the Kuroshio Extension region and other causes directly
   affecting sardine. In this study, we found that sardine mortality from
   post-larva to age 1 negatively correlated with the winter mixed layer
   depth (MLD) in the Kuroshio Extension region from 1979 to 1993. During
   the period of a deep winter mixed layer (during the early 1980s),
   sardine mortality was low, whereas mortality was high when the winter
   mixed layer was shallow (during the late 1980s to early 1990s). By using
   a lower trophic-level ecosystem model forced by the observed time series
   of MLD, SST, light intensity and nutrient data, we found that the
   estimated spring zooplankton density drastically varies from year to
   year and has a significant negative correlation with sardine mortality.
   The inter-annual variation of spring zooplankton density is caused by
   the winter MLD variation. During the deep winter mixed layer years, a
   phytoplankton bloom occurs in spring, whereas during the shallow winter
   mixed layer years, the bloom occurs in winter. The results of our study
   suggest that the decline in the Japanese sardine population during the
   late 1980s to early 1990s was due to an insufficient spring food supply
   in the Kuroshio Extension region where sardine larvae and juvenile are
   transported.

   time series for global temperatures and fossil fuel CO2 emissions with
   related combinations of polynomials, exponentials, and sinusoids, using
   least squares fits that can be done by students well grounded in
   practical statistics. The analysis suggested that temperatures cycle
   around a monotonically increasing, accelerating baseline with a period
   of approximate to65 years and that the exponential growth rate Of CO2
   emissions varies inversely with this cycle. The Gaia hypothesis [5]
   suggests that the biosphere adjusts atmospheric greenhouse gases to

   extended with a series of fitting exercises designed to demonstrate that
   the above described inverse relation represents a Gaian feedback.

AB The urban heat island effect, where urban areas exhibit higher
   temperatures than less-developed suburban and natural habitats, occurs
   in cities across the globe and is well understood from a physical
   perspective and at broad spatial scales. However, very little is known
   about how thermal variation caused by urbanization influences the
   ability of organisms to live in cities. Ectotherms are sensitive to
   environmental changes that affect thermal conditions, and therefore,
   increased urban temperatures may pose significant challenges to
   thermoregulation and alter temperature-dependent activity. To evaluate
   whether these changes to the thermal environment affect the persistence
   and dispersal of ectothermic species in urban areas, we studied two
   species of Anolis lizards (Anolis cristatellus and Anolis sagrei)
   introduced to Miami-Dade County, FL, USA, where they occur in both urban
   and natural habitats. We calculated canopy openness and measured
   operative temperature (T-e), which estimates the distribution of body
   temperatures in a non-thermoregulating population, in four urban and
   four natural sites. We also captured lizards throughout the day and
   recorded their internal body temperature (T-b). We found that urban
   areas had more open canopies and higher T-e compared to natural
   habitats. Laboratory trials showed that A. cristatellus preferred lower
   temperatures than A. sagrei. Urban sites currently occupied by each
   species appear to lower thermoregulatory costs for both species, but
   only A. sagreihad field T-b that were more often within their preferred
   temperature range in urban habitats compared to natural areas.
   Furthermore, based on available T-e within each species' preferred
   temperature range, urban sites with only A. sagrei appear less suitable
   for A. cristatellus, whereas natural sites with only A. cristatellus are
   less suitable for A. sagrei. These results highlight how the thermal
   properties of urban areas contribute to patterns of persistence and
   dispersal, particularly relevant for studying species invasions
   worldwide.

AB Landscape changes are known to exacerbate the impacts of climate change.
   As such, understanding the combined effect of climate and landscape on
   agroecosystems is vital if we are to maintain the function of
   agroecosystems. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of
   agricultural landscape complexity on the microclimate and thermal
   tolerance of an aphid pest to better understand how landscape and
   climate may interact to affect the thermal tolerance of pest species
   within the context of global climate change. Meteorological data were
   measured at the landscape level, and cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae,
   Metopolophium dirhodum and Rhopalosiphum padi) sampled, from contrasting
   landscapes (simple and complex) in winter 2013/2014 and spring 2014 in
   cereal fields of Brittany, France. Aphids were returned to the
   laboratory and the effect of landscape of origin on aphid cold tolerance
   (as determined by CTmin) was investigated. Results revealed that local
   landscape complexity significantly affected microclimate, with simple
   homogenous landscapes being on average warmer, but with greater
   temperature variation. Landscape complexity was shown to impact aphid
   cold tolerance, with aphids from complex landscapes being more cold
   tolerant than those from simple landscapes in both winter and spring,
   but with differences among species. This study highlights that future
   changes to land use could have implications for the thermal tolerance
   and adaptability of insects. Furthermore, not all insect species respond
   in a similar way to microhabitat and microclimate, which could disrupt
   important predator-prey relationships and the ecosystem service they
   provide.

AB The Canadian Prairies have undergone important land use changes over the
   past 150 years. Beginning in the early 20th century, a significant
   portion of agricultural land was under surnmerfallow primarily to
   conserve soil moisture. The area under fallow grew to over 11 Mha, which
   constitute about 25% of Canada's cultivated land, and mostly remained at
   that level until 1975, subsequent to which improved land management
   practices led to significant reductions in areas under summerfallow. By
   2001 surnmerfallow area had been reduced to 5.4 Mha, and future
   projections expect it to fall to 3.5 Mha. Numerous modeling studies and
   observations have shown that land use change can have a significant
   impact on regional and local climate. In the Canadian Prairies, these
   effects would likely be seen during the mid-June to mid-July period,
   when agricultural crops undergo rapid foliar expansion and substantial
   transpiration, thus contributing to significantly higher latent heat
   fluxes. Observations of 1976-2000 climate trends in the black, dark
   brown and brown soil zones of the Canadian Prairies showed that there
   have been substantial reductions in maximum temperature (1.7 degrees C
   decade(-1)), diurnal temperature range (1.1 degrees C decade(-1)) and
   solar radiation (1.2 MJ m(-2) decade(-1)), as well as a corresponding
   increase in precipitation (10.3 mm decade(-1)) during the mid-June to
   July period. These findings are in opposition to trends that would be
   expected from climate change from an enhanced greenhouse effect, and
   suggest that there is substantial correspondence between reductions in
   surnmerfallow and changes in climate in the agricultural regions of the
   Canadian Prairies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   as the Himalayas. By conducting a study at two high altitude (3200-4100
   m) valleys (Langtang and Tsum) situated in the central part of the Nepal
   Himalayas, we presented tree-ring width site chronologies for
   twoLarixspecies(Larix griffithiiandL. himalaica) for the first time. The
   longest chronology spans from 1771 to 2015 AD and showed a recent
   decline in the growth ofLarixspecies in both sites, controlled mainly by
   drought. Tree growth showed a negative response to temperature and a
   positive response to precipitation, indicating that moisture stress is
   limiting the growth of the species. Based on theLarixring width
   chronology statistics and climate response results, these species have
   good potential for past climate reconstruction such as temperature,
   rainfall or drought indices. Also, the study revealed that the Himalayan
   endemicLarixspecies investigated are promising for tree-ring based
   multi-aspect environmental change studies in the future.

AB Estimating abundance is critical in many areas of ecology and
   conservation biology. Despite this, methodological limitations prevent
   population monitoring at large spatial scales. Automated acoustic
   methods, such as recording devices and sound recognition models, can
   determine occupancy and phenology but have not been utilized to estimate
   abundance in amphibians. Here we evaluate a method to estimate the
   number of breeding female Wood Frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) on the
   basis of the relationship between egg mass abundance and the acoustic
   activity of males, using an automated recognizer to count and quantify
   their vocalizations. We collected egg mass abundance data and recorded
   acoustic activity at sites in New Brunswick, Canada and the northern
   United States in 2015 and 2016. Egg mass abundance at a site was best
   predicted by the maximum daily number of calls on the basis of a model
   selection approach and the predictive ability of models (root mean
   square error +/- 16-19 egg masses or 59-70%). The number of males in the
   pond was best explained by mean calls per recording in 2016 but in 2015
   no acoustic metric explained male abundance well. Although this method
   shows promise, variation in 1) the quality of the recordings, 2) the
   timing of vocalization activity, and 3) the sex ratios among sites and
   years combine to increase the error in abundance estimates. With
   additional research, this method could be useful for monitoring at large
   spatial scales and we encourage additional trials of acoustic estimates
   of abundance, especially where estimates of abundance already exist
   using other methods.

AB Behavioural thermoregulation has the potential to alleviate the
   short-term impacts of climate change on some small ectotherms, without
   the need for changes to species distributions or genetic adaptation. We
   illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate
   species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial
   and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments.
   Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging
   grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily
   period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the
   temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated
   and the subsequent reductions in body temperature.
   Behavioural means such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with
   optimum surface temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments
   (e.g. stilting, vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective
   at maintaining preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily
   tolerated temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4
   degrees C, indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this
   species. Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small
   ectotherms to regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures
   and utilize the spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they
   occupy. Species such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to
   cool temperate conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond
   successfully to coarse scale climate change. (C) 2015 Published by

AB Basking is an understudied aspect of turtle biology, especially
   considering how frequent and observable it is in some species.
   Researchers have suggested many physiological roles that basking likely
   fulfills in turtles. We documented seasonal basking behavior of the
   yellow-blotched sawback (Graptemys flavimaculata) on the Leaf River, a
   tributary of the Pascagoula River in southeastern Mississippi. We used
   binoculars and a spotting scope to determine G. flavimaculata
   individual- and population-level basking patterns throughout the main
   active months (April October) and across the daily activity period; we
   also describe a new method to determine population basking percentage
   that may be useful for future aquatic turtle surveys. We found distinct
   differences in individual- and population-level basking behavior across
   months, sexes, and the daily activity period. We also documented
   differences in basking structures used between the sexes but found
   little correlation between population-level basking and several
   environmental temperature variables.

AB Recent research has linked climate warming to global declines in caribou
   and reindeer (both Rangifer tarandus) populations. We hypothesize
   large-scale climate patterns are a contributing factor explaining why
   these declines are not universal. To test our hypothesis for such
   relationships among Alaska caribou herds, we calculated the population
   growth rate and percent change of four arctic herds using existing
   population estimates, and explored associations with indices of the
   Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The
   AO, which more strongly affects eastern Alaska, was negatively
   associated with the population trends of the Porcupine Caribou Herd and
   Central Arctic Herd, the easternmost of the herds. We hypothesize that
   either increased snowfall or suboptimal growing conditions for summer
   forage plants could explain this negative relationship. Intensity of the
   PDO, which has greatest effects in western Alaska, was negatively
   associated with the growth rate of the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd in
   northwestern Alaska, but the Western Arctic Herd in western Alaska
   displayed the opposite trend. We suggest that the contrasting patterns
   of association relate to the spatial variability of the effects of the
   PDO on western and northwestern Alaska. Although predation and winter
   range quality have often been considered the primary causes of
   population variation, our results show that large-scale climate patterns
   may play an important role in caribou population dynamics in arctic
   Alaska. Our findings reveal that climate warming has not acted uniformly
   to reduce caribou populations globally. Further research should focus on
   the relative importance of mechanisms by which climate indices influence
   caribou population dynamics.

AB Although genotypic differences among soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)
   cultivars in their response to future CO2 partial pressures have been
   observed in the glasshouse, it is unclear if similar responses would
   occur among cultivars when grown under field conditions at normal stand
   densities. To determine variation in the sensitivity of soybean growth
   and seed yield to CO2, we grew two contrasting cultivars of the same
   maturity group, Ripley (semi- dwarf, determinate) and Spencer (standard,
   indeterminate), to reproductive maturity at ambient and elevated (30 Pa
   above ambient) CO2 partial pressures for two field seasons. Spencer had
   been previously selected in glasshouse trials as responsive to increased
   CO2. Significant cultivar x CO2 interaction was observed for both
   vegetative biomass and seed yield, with Spencer demonstrating a
   consistently greater yield enhancement at elevated CO2 than Ripley (60
   vs 35%, respectively). Differences in CO2 sensitivity between cultivars
   were not evident in measurements of single leaf photosynthesis taken
   during anthesis, nor early or late pod-fill. Analysis of reproductive
   characteristics indicated that the sensitivity of the seed yield
   response to CO2 in Spencer was associated with the ability to form
   additional seed on axillary branches in response to elevated CO2. Data
   from this experiment suggest that screening of soybean germplasm at the
   glasshouse level, when combined with field trials, may be an effective
   strategy to begin selecting soybean lines that will maximize yield in a
   future, higher CO2 environment.

AB The study addressed the ecology and life cycle of two charophyte
   species, which are both at risk of extinction and on several Red Lists
   in Europe. Populations of Nitella opaca and N. gracilis, sometimes
   occurring together in three wetland ponds, were monitored for several
   years, and environmental data were also recorded. The pattern and timing
   of emergence (new shoots) and maturation of the sexual organs
   (antheridia, oogonia, and ripe oospores) were determined on plant
   samples collected regularly. The species phenophases were related to the
   environmental data. The results showed that species distribution can be
   linked to the water calcium content, a parameter that most differed in
   the three ponds. N. gracilis developed population only in ponds with
   very low calcium concentrations, whereas N. opaca had a wider tolerance.
   Following a pond bed air exposure in previous year, dense populations of
   N. opaca and N. gracilis were observed. None, or only a few individuals,
   were found when the waterbodies remained flooded the whole preceding
   year. Light and temperature affect differently the emergence of sex
   organs and the maturation of oospores. Both species differed in the
   timing of their phenophases. N. opaca appeared in March, reproduced and
   disappeared in July. N. gracilis was generally observed later in spring,
   and after full reproduction, the plants started a second cycle in late
   summer, while new oospore germination occurred. N. gracilis was
   perennial and reproduced all year long. Taking these results into
   account will help to design conservation plans for N. opaca and N.
   gracilis.

AB The importance of microhabitat, a localized environment with a
   microclimate that is distinct from the regional climate, is increasingly
   recognized in ecological conservation planning. Although there is a
   growing body of literature on microhabitats and the thermal buffering
   effect (the difference between temperatures within and outside of a
   microhabitat), uncertainties remain in quantifying this effect due to
   variation among microhabitats and the species that use them. Here, we
   review studies on thermal buffering in various microhabitats, and
   outline a framework for the quantification of the thermal buffering
   effect. Our framework emphasizes the importance of clearly defining
   ambient temperature and other temperature metrics used in quantifying
   the thermal buffering effect, as well as the spatial and temporal scales
   of investigation. We believe a suitable framework can help to reduce the
   uncertainties in quantifying the thermal buffering of microhabitats and
   assessing the vulnerability of species to regional climate changes. (C)

AB Secondary sexual traits that are condition-dependent are expected to
   reveal the physiological state and/or genetic quality of individuals,
   and therefore, should more often be found to be under sexual selection
   than (1) secondary sexual traits not currently condition-dependent, and
   (2) nonsecondary sexual traits. In the present study, we contrasted the
   degree of condition dependence in three morphological traits of male
   Drosophila bipectinata: two secondary sexual traits (distinct components
   of the sex comb), one of which significantly predicts mating success in
   nature (segment 2), whereas the other does not (segment 1), and a
   nonsecondary sexual trait (sternopleural bristle number). As predicted,
   comb segment 2 decreased significantly in size, in response to
   increasing temperature during development, whereas comb segment 1 and
   sternopleural bristle number either did not change significantly, or
   increased with increasing temperature. These results support the
   hypothesis that condition-dependence, inferred from stress-induced
   reductions in trait expression, engenders a trait to sexual selection.
   Small-combed genotypes did not exhibit disproportionate reductions in
   larva-to-adult survivorship and adult body size compared to large-combed
   genotypes, suggesting that comb size does not reveal genotypic quality,
   at least as revealed by sensitivity in body size and juvenile
   survivorship to thermal stress. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

AB Diatom and silicoflagellate fossils from surface sediments were analyzed
   at 63 sites in the Bohai Sea. Their spatial variations of the fossils
   were indicative of past environmental conditions, hydrodynamics, and the
   interaction of the Yellow Sea intrusion and Yellow River discharge into
   the Bohai Sea. In total, 162 taxa were identified. Higher species
   diversity and lower abundance occurred near the mouth of the Yellow
   River and Laizhou Bay, while lower species diversity and higher
   abundance occurred in the Central Bohai Sea and Bohai Strait. The
   spatial differences between fossil diversity and abundance are strongly
   related to the freshwater and sediment inputs from the Yellow River;
   lower salinity provides a diverse habitat for brackish and marine
   species, while a higher deposition rate can dilute the fossil
   concentrations.
   Three distinct biofacies representing the Laizhou Bay, Central Bohai Sea
   and Bohai Strait were classified after principal component analysis. The
   dominant species along the salinity gradient shifted from Paralia
   sulcata in the Bohai Strait to Cyclotella stylorum and Dictyocha
   messanensis in the Laizhou Bay, while a mixing zone existed in the
   Central Bohai Sea. The canonical correspondence analysis between major
   species and environmental factors indicated a relationship between P.
   sulcata and the Yellow Sea intrusion, with significant positive
   correlations being observed between salinity gradient, water depth and
   autumn temperature. In comparison, C. stylorum and D. messanensis were
   related to the discharge of the Yellow River, having significant
   positive correlations with the low-salinity and nutrient-rich
   environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread recognition of the importance of biological studies at large
   spatial and temporal scales, particularly in the face of many of the
   most pressing issues facing humanity, has fueled the argument that there
   is a need to reinvigorate such studies in physiological ecology through
   the establishment of a macrophysiology. Following a period when the
   fields of ecology and physiological ecology had been regarded as largely
   synonymous, studies of this kind were relatively commonplace in the
   first half of the twentieth century. However, such large-scale work
   subsequently became rather scarce as physiological studies concentrated
   on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the capacities
   and tolerances of species. In some sense, macrophysiology is thus an
   attempt at a conceptual reunification. In this article, we provide a
   conceptual framework for the continued development of macrophysiology.
   We subdivide this framework into three major components: the
   establishment of macrophysiological patterns, determining the form of
   those patterns (the very general ways in which they are shaped), and
   understanding the mechanisms that give rise to them. We suggest ways in
   which each of these components could be developed usefully.

AB A diatom record from core MD992275 on the North Icelandic shelf reveals
   palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic changes during the time interval
   9000 to 5600 cal. year BP. The study period includes the Holocene
   Climate Optimum (HCO), as widely known in the North Atlantic region. A
   comparison with data for the last 2000 years and with the present-day
   surface sediment diatom assemblages shows that there was considerably
   stronger influence of Atlantic water masses in the area during the HCO
   than in the late Holocene and today. The results of cluster analysis and
   principal component analysis divide the studied period into three
   intervals, each characterised by a specific diatom assemblage. The
   assemblages indicate changes in the interaction of the relatively warm
   Irminger Current (IC) and the cold East Greenland Current (EGC) and East
   Icelandic Current (EIC). The North Icelandic shelf was strongly affected
   by the IC during the interval 8000-6800 cal. year BP, which may be the
   warmest period of the Holocene. During the intervals 9000-8000 and
   6800-5600 cal. year BP, the influence of the IC was relatively weak and
   that of the EGC and EIC increased correspondingly. The well-known 8200
   cal. year BP cooling event, shown in many records from the North
   Atlantic, is reflected by a relatively strong influence of the EGC and
   EIC between about 8300 and 8 100 cal. year BP in our record. However,
   the diatom assemblages show that the inferred circulation change did not
   bring the strength of the IC down to the levels seen at present and

AB Pinus wallichiana is the most dominant evergreen species at upper
   treeline, which is naturally distributed in the Karakoram region of
   northern Pakistan. The age of this species is reaching up to 800-years
   old. However, little is known the impact of the climate on the tree
   growth. In the present study, we developed a long (1409-2015) tree-ring
   width (TRW) chronology from the upper Pinus wallichiana forest limit to
   investigate its response to climate change. The TRW was significantly
   (p<0.05) correlated with the winter (December-February) temperatures and
   had no significant correlations with precipitation and Palmer Drought
   Severity Index (PDSI). These fmdings confirmed that the Pinus
   wallichiana tree growth was mainly limited to temperature rather than
   precipitation and PDSI, and suggesting that this species had a potential
   for the past climate reconstruction in the study area.

AB Aims: The current paper focuses on quantifying ground vegetation,
   estimating age, distribution and ecological conditions in 28 birch
   forest stands. Another key objective of this study was to investigate
   whether these forests are temperature limited. We also determined if
   there were any significant differences in ecological conditions between
   forest, scattered trees and shrub plots. Study area: Sampling was
   conducted in northernmost birch forests (dominated by Betula pubescens)
   found along the coast in Finnmark (Norway). These forest limits are used
   to delimit the boreal biome from the alpine/arctic biome and are assumed
   to have a bioclimatic characterization. Methods: Soil and air
   temperatures were measured within selected stands and soil samples and
   tree cores were collected. Results: The results showed the field layer
   to be dominated by Empetrum-Cornus-Vaccinium, Polytrichum-Cornus and
   Cirsium-Viola types; the gradients between these types being explained
   by pH, July temperatures and thaw days. Based on the tree-ring data, the
   age of the trees was estimated to be 1177 yr. Elevated levels of calcium
   were evident in some of the study plots. Conclusions: We found no
   differences in temperature conditions and soil properties between
   forests, scattered trees and shrubby stands (with the exception of
   potassium concentration). The overall temperature conditions in present
   study were warmer than in other northern limit of birch forests. This
   suggests, that forests are probably not limited by temperature
   conditions, but more likely limited by strong wind, topography and
   absence of land further north. However, more data is necessary to
   confirm this hypothesis.

AB A highly winter-active cultivar of tall fescue, Melik, was compared with
   3 commercial cultivars in a field experiment in South West Victoria.
   Winter production of Melik was superior to the widely used commercial
   cultivars (P<0.05). In a second experiment, a selection from a Melik
   nursery, designated Melik Select, was compared with the summer-active
   cultivars, Demeter and AU Triumph. Seed blends of Melik Select and
   Demeter (1:2 or 2:1 mix) were also evaluated and seasonal production was
   measured under grazing. Over 3 years, the cumulative yield of tall
   fescue per se was not different between cultivars, despite a 73%
   increase in winter for Melik Select compared with Demeter (P<0.001).
   Melik Select produced 55% of its annual yield in winter. For Demeter the
   winter proportion was 33%. Spring (P<0.01) and summer production
   (P<0.001) was superior from the summer-active cultivars, Demeter and AU
   Triumph, when compared with the yield from Melik Select. Melik Select
   plots were however, characterised by higher contributions from
   subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). After 7 years of
   rotational grazing by sheep, the frequency of Melik Select plants (63%)
   was greater than that of Demeter (9%) and AU Triumph (8%) (P<0.01).
   Melik Select exhibited greater crown rust (Puccinia coronata) resistance
   than Demeter and AU Triumph (P<0.001) in autumn.
   The seed blend treatments, which included 66% Melik Select, did not
   increase winter production above that obtained from the summer-active
   cultivars (P>0.05). It was concluded that, while increased cool season
   production from tall fescue may be obtained by the use of highly
   winter-active cultivars sown alone, blends of the contrasting types of
   tall fescue may provide a more even distribution of growth throughout
   the year. To significantly increase winter growth in the Hamilton
   climate, however, the highly winter-active component may have to
   represent >66% of the blend. Options for using Mediterranean type tall
   fescue for their autumn-winter growth potential are discussed for
   districts with a shorter growing season.
   Melik Select was compared against 5 check cultivars, in a 3-year field
   experiment at Hamilton, to characterise the seasonal growth of 36
   Neotyphodium endophyte infected accessions of tall fescue collected from
   the Mediterranean basin. These accessions contained endophyte variants
   differing from N. coenophialum, as found in continental winter-dormant
   types of tall fescue. Ratings confirmed the importance of Mediterranean
   material as a source of vigorous growth during the cool season. Melik
   Select was superior to other cultivars and accessions in both the cool
   and warm seasons. The use of Melik Select to develop and evaluate a new
   type of highly winter-active tall fescue for temperate Australia, since
   released as cultivar Fraydo, is discussed.

AB Study of the radial growth response to climate factors at different tree
   ages is essential for predicting forest dynamics and formulating correct
   management policies. In this study, we analysed the growth
   responsiveness of Picea crassifolia to climate conditions, and evaluated
   its relationship to tree age at the individual tree scale, in the
   transitional zone between regions affected by the East Asian monsoon and
   winds blowing from the west (westerlies) in the Qilian Mountains. On
   three study sites, 150 cores were taken from 75 trees. Pearson
   correlation coefficients were calculated between the standardized
   tree-ring series of each core (and chronology) and climatic factors
   which were utilized to research the climate-growth relationships.
   Quadratic polynomial fitting was used to test the relationships between
   tree age, chronological parameters, and the radial growth response to
   climate. Radial growth was positively influenced by total precipitation
   for the previous July-September and the current May-July. Additionally,
   radial growth was negatively correlated with the total monthly
   precipitation for the current September, and the mean monthly
   temperature for the previous July. Trees younger than 80 years old
   showed a stronger response to accumulative precipitation in the previous
   July-September, those older than 160 years old showed a stronger
   response to precipitation at the end of current growing season, while
   those of 140-160 years old showed a weaker response to precipitation in
   the current May-July.

AB This paper describes a new approach to the calibration of thermal
   infrared measurements of leaf temperature for the estimation of stomatal
   conductance and illustrates its application to thermal imaging of plant
   leaves. The approach is based on a simple reformulation of the leaf
   energy balance equation that makes use of temperature measurements on
   reference surfaces of known conductance to water vapour. The use of
   reference surfaces is an alternative to the accurate measurement of all
   components of the leaf energy balance and is of potentially wide
   application in studies of stomatal behaviour. The resolution of the
   technique when applied to thermal images is evaluated and some results
   of using the approach in the laboratory for the study of stomatal
   behaviour in leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. are presented. Conductances
   calculated from infrared measurements were well correlated with
   estimates obtained using a diffusion porometer.

AB 1 Bean leaf beetle Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster) (Coleoptera:
   Chrysomelidae) is a pest of soybean in the U.S.A. and is becoming a
   concern in Canada. The projected increase in winter temperatures under
   climate change could affect overwinter survival, timing of spring
   emergence and, ultimately, the severity of this pest.
   2 We assessed the potential effects of warmer winters in field
   experiments performed in three consecutive years. Three warming levels
   were applied: (i) heated approximately 4 degrees C above ambient; (ii)
   unheated with snow cover left intact; and (iii) unheated with snow cover
   removed. Survival and date of emergence were assessed in all years, and
   beetle lipid content was analyzed in 1 year to determine rates of energy
   use.
   3 Overwinter survival was 6.5-14.5% among years. Winter warming
   inconsistently affected overwinter survival: increasing survival in one
   winter, decreasing survival in the warmest winter and having no effect
   in one winter. Beetles that received supplemental winter warming emerged
   approximately 2 weeks earlier in spring, and lipid content did not
   differ among treatment groups.
   4 Earlier spring emergence may allow for the production of an additional
   generation per year of C. trifurcata under future climate change.
   However, further experiments are required to establish the relationship
   between overwinter survival and subsequent beetle population growth to
   determine potential pest status and best management practices under
   future climate conditions.

AB The existence of hybrid dwarfs from intraspecific crosses in wheat
   (Triticum aestivum) was described 100years ago, and the genetics
   underlying hybrid dwarfness are well understood. In this study, we
   report a dwarf phenotype in interspecific hybrids between wheat and rye
   (Secale cereale). We identified two rye lines that produce hybrid dwarfs
   with wheat and have none of the hitherto known hybrid dwarfing genes.
   Genetic analyses revealed that both rye lines carry a single allelic
   gene responsible for the dwarf phenotype. This gene was designated
   Hdw-R1 (Hybrid dwarf-R1). Application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) to
   both intraspecific (wheat-wheat) and interspecific (wheat-rye) hybrids
   showed that hybrid dwarfness cannot be overcome by treatment with this
   phytohormone. Histological analysis of shoot apices showed that
   wheat-rye hybrids with the dwarf phenotype at 21 and 45days after
   germination failed to develop further. Shoot apices of dwarf plants did
   not elongate, did not form new primordia and had a dome-shaped
   appearance in the seed. The possible relationship between hybrid
   dwarfness and the genes responsible for the transition from vegetative
   to generative growth stage is discussed.

AB C-13 discrimination in organic matter with respect to atmospheric CO2
   (Delta C-13) is under tight genetic control in many plant species,
   including the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) full-sib progeny used
   in this study. Delta C-13 is expected to reflect intrinsic water use
   efficiency, but this assumption requires confirmation due to potential
   interferences with mesophyll conductance to CO2, or post-photosynthetic
   discrimination. In order to dissect the observed Delta C-13 variability
   in this progeny, six genotypes that have previously been found to
   display extreme phenotypic values of Delta C-13 [either very high ('high
   Delta') or low ('low Delta') phenotype] were selected, and transpiration
   efficiency (TE; accumulated biomass/transpired water), net CO2
   assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance for water vapour (g(s)), and
   intrinsic water use efficiency (W-i=A/g(s)) were compared with Delta
   C-13 in bulk leaf matter, wood, and cellulose in wood. As expected,
   'high Delta' displayed higher values of Delta C-13 not only in bulk leaf
   matter, but also in wood and cellulose. This confirmed the stability of
   the genotypic differences in Delta C-13 recorded earlier. 'High Delta'
   also displayed lower TE, lower W-i, and higher g(s). A small difference
   was detected in photosynthetic capacity but none in mesophyll
   conductance to CO2. 'High Delta' and 'low Delta' displayed very similar
   leaf anatomy, except for higher stomatal density in 'high Delta'.
   Finally, diurnal courses of leaf gas exchange revealed a higher g(s) in
   'high Delta' in the morning than in the afternoon when the difference
   decreased. The gene ERECTA, involved in the control of water use
   efficiency, leaf differentiation, and stomatal density, displayed higher
   expression levels in 'low Delta'. In this progeny, the variability of
   Delta C-13 correlated closely with that of W-i and TE. Genetic
   differences of Delta C-13 and W-i can be ascribed to differences in
   stomatal conductance and stomatal density but not in photosynthetic
   capacity.

AB Climate change-induced extreme heat events are becoming a major issue in
   different parts of the world, especially in developing countries. The
   assessment of regional and temporal past and future change in heat waves
   is a crucial task for public health strategies and managements. The
   historical and future heat index (HI) time series are investigated for
   temporal change across Iran to study the impact of global warming on
   public health. The heat index is calculated, and the nonparametric trend
   assessment is carried out for historical time series (1981-2010). The
   future change in heat index is also projected for 2020-2049 and
   2070-2099 periods. A rise in the historical heat index and extreme
   caution conditions for summer and spring seasons for major parts of Iran
   are notable for historical (1981-2010) series in this study. Using
   different climate change scenarios shows that heat index will exceed the
   critical threshold for human adaptability in the future in the country.
   The impact of climate change on heat index risk in Iran is significant
   in the future. To cope with this crucial situation, developing early
   warning systems and health care strategies to deal with population
   growth and remarkable socio-economic features in future is essential.

AB Mature thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a highly
   unstable metallocarboxypeptidase that stabilizes blood clots by clipping
   C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin. In accordance
   with its in vitro antifibrinolytic activity, animal studies have
   reported that inhibition of mature TAFI aids in the prevention of
   thrombosis. The level of TAFI activity is stringently regulated through
   (i) controlled proteolytic truncation of the zymogen (TAFI), generating
   the mature enzyme, TAFIa, and (ii) the short half-life of TAFIa. TAFI
   itself exhibits an intrinsic enzymatic activity, which is likely
   required to provide a baseline level of antifibrinolytic activity. The
   novel crystal structure presented here reveals that the active site of
   TAFI is accessible, providing the structural explanation for the its
   intrinsic activity. It also supports the notion that an "instability
   region" exists, in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis studies.
   Sulfate ions, bound to this region, point toward a potential
   heparin-binding site and could explain how heparin stabilizes TAFIa.

AB Models can be useful to help understand population dynamics of insects
   under diverse environmental conditions and in developing strategies to
   better manage pest species. Adult longevity and fecundity of Helicoverpa
   armigera (Hubner) were evaluated against a wide range of constant
   temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 37.5 degrees C). The modified
   Sharpe and DeMichele model described adult aging rate and was used to
   estimate adult physiological age. Maximum fecundity of H. armigera was
   973 eggs per female at 25 degrees C decreasing to 72 eggs per female at
   37.5 degrees C. The relationship between adult fecundity and temperature
   was well described by an extreme value function. Age-specific cumulative
   oviposition rate and age-specific survival rate were well described by a
   two-parameter Weibull function and sigmoid function, respectively. An
   oviposition model was developed using three temperature-dependent
   components: total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate, and
   age-specific survival rate. The oviposition model was validated against
   independent field data and described the pattern of field occurrence of
   H. armigera egg numbers very well. Our model will be a useful component
   for population modeling of H. armigera and can be independently used for
   the timing of sprays in management programs targeting this key pest
   species.

AB In 2003, Canadian Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study conducted 3
   research expeditions (April-May, July and October) to the Northwest
   Atlantic to study gas exchange at the air-sea interface. Interpreting
   the relationships between gas exchange and biological activity measured
   in these expeditions is facilitated if the water masses sampled can be
   identified in a large-scale context. Longhurst et al. (1995) tackled the
   issue of water mass characterisation by defining biogeochemical
   provinces for the world ocean and in particular for the NW Atlantic. To
   avoid the limitations that arise from the static arrangement of
   provinces with rectilinear boundaries as used in Longhurst et al.
   (1995), we developed a dynamic method based on statistical analysis of
   geophysical and biological data to delineate the boundaries of
   Longhurst's provinces in real time. This new method was applied to
   satellite-retrieved sea-surface temperature (SST) and phyto-plankton
   biomass data averaged over the length of the research cruises (22, 17
   and 16 d in spring, summer and fall respectively). CTD casts at various
   stations along the ship track were used to validate the method. A
   sensitivity study on primary production estimations performed with both
   definitions (static and dynamic) showed a negligible difference at the
   basin scale; however, variations at the province scale were significant,
   The regional description afforded by the new method was useful for the
   interpretation of expedition data.

AB Twelve healthy male subjects each undertook two bouts of moderate

   rate, core (rectal) temperature, sternum skin temperature, and forearm
   skin blood flow during baseline conditions, during the bout of exercise,
   and throughout a 30-minute recovery period. Comparisons were made of the
   changes of heart rate, temperature, and skin blood flow produced by the
   exercise at the two times of day. Student t tests indicated that
   baseline values for core temperature (37.15 degrees C +/- 0.06 degrees C
   vs. 36.77 degrees C +/- 0.06 degrees C) and sternum temperature (33.60
   degrees C +/- 0.29 degrees C vs. 32.70 degrees C +/- 0.38 degrees C)
   were significantly (p < .05) higher in the late afternoon than the early
   morning. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the
   increases in core and sternum temperatures during exercise were
   significantly less (p = .0039 and .0421, respectively) during the
   afternoon bout of exercise compared with the morning, even though the
   work loads, as determined by changes in heart rate, were not
   significantly different (p = .798) at the two times of testing. There
   were also tendencies for resting forearm skin blood flow to be higher in
   the afternoon than in the morning and for exercise to produce a more
   rapid rise in this variable in the afternoon. The possible mechanisms
   producing these responses to exercise are discussed in terms of those
   that are responsible for the normal circadian rhythm of core

   load is less in the early morning, when the circadian system is in a
   "heat gain" mode, than in the late afternoon, when heat gain and "heat

AB Developmental stability (DS) may confer an advantage in competition for
   mates. The present study tests this hypothesis using Drosophila
   immigrans, and proposes a novel approach to help broadly define the
   epigenetic factors causing such an effect. We first estimated the
   magnitude of isofemale heritability in sternopleural bristle fluctuating
   asymmetry (FA), using replicate genetic lines extracted from nature.
   Positional FA (PFA) exhibited significant among-line variation, and the
   heritability estimate of 0.10 (0.046 s.e.m.) was statistically
   significant. Among individual males, there was a significant positive
   relationship between PFA and copulation latency (time elapsed between
   introduction of females and copulation) and duration, but not copulation
   frequency. Moreover, high-DS lines exhibited significantly shorter
   copulation latency and duration compared with low-DS lines. When these
   components of sexual performance were again contrasted between lines
   with among-individual differences in bristle asymmetry controlled
   statistically, significant line effects on copulation latency and
   duration disappeared. The results suggest that deficits in the
   developmental apparatus underlying one particular trait can compromise
   individual sexual performance, and weaken the hypothesis that FA is a
   cue of overall 'genetic quality'.

AB Taxonomic composition and productivity of winter and spring
   phytoplankton in a eutrophic estuary have been investigated in order to
   elucidate the carbon flux under conditions of limitation by physical
   factors - light and temperature. In spite of the important differences
   in nutrients, solar radiation and water temperature between winter and
   spring season. mean concentrations of particulate organic carbon were
   equal to 13.2 and 13.0 mgC 1(-1), respectively. Chlorophyll a averaged
   at 79 mugChl 1(-1) in winter. that is 69% of spring. Although community
   respiration accounted for only 6-26% of light saturated photosynthesis,
   integrated net primary production of the 1.2 in deep water column was
   negative until April. High attenuation of the water body (K = 2.9 m(-1))
   lead to a negative carbon balance (net heterotrophy) below 35 cm for all
   sampling dates. Thus, the high winter POC and phytoplankton values can
   only originate from summer or autumn primary production. This assumption
   was supported by a carbon loss rate of just 3% of total organic carbon
   per day for the whole water column. The composition of phytoplankton was
   very constant through both seasons: 39% Chlorophyceae, 33% Cyanobacteria
   and 25% Bacillariophyceae. As expected. phyloplankton was low light
   acclimated, having high a values (slope of light limited
   photosynthesis), but moderate maximum photosynthesis rates at saturating
   irradiances, which were heavily affected by temperature. Calculation of
   net carbon flux yet showed net heterotrophy of the Bodden waters in
   winter and early spring were caused by external physical limitation (low
   surface irradiance and low temperature) in combination with a high light
   attenuation of the water body. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   profoundly affects their behavior. Here we measure in a simple geometry
   the forces a cell exerts suspended by two optical traps. Our assay
   quantifies both the overall force and the fraction of that force
   transmitted to the environment. Mimicking environments of varying
   stiffness by adjusting the strength of the traps, we found that the

AB The temporal variations in distribution pattern of Scots pines (Pinus
   sylvestris L.) have been used as an annual resolution record of past
   lake-level changes. Logs, preserved for thousands of years in bog and
   lakes (subfossil wood), were sampled from small lakes of the
   Scandinavian Mountains in west-central Sweden to construct a tree-ring
   chronology from an area where pines are sensitive to growth season (ie,
   summer) temperature. The chronology spans from AD 2006 to 4868 BC, with
   two minor gaps at 1600 BC and AD 900 and one larger gap at 2900 BC. The
   dendrochronological approach can provide a high quality long-term
   perspective on lake level fluctuations, which possibly can be coupled to
   changes in humidity. Submerged trunks were found in situ, embedded in
   sediments, and because trees from the earliest periods were not
   necessarily found at the deepest levels, this shows clearly that lake
   levels must have been lower than present at the time of tree-growth. The
   lake levels must have fluctuated, creating alternating conditions of
   pine regeneration and mortality. The fluctuating lake levels recorded
   are suggested to be a result of regional humidity increases and
   decreases, mainly governed by precipitation changes. Periods of lower
   lake levels were inferred at 4900-4800 BC, 3800-3600 BC, 3400-3250 BC,
   2400-2200 BC, 2100-1800 BC, 1500-1100 BC, 900-800 BC, 400-100 BC, AD

AB The El Ni?o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase state is reported to drive
   interannual variability in sea temperatures along South Africa?s south
   coast through its influence on wind-induced upwelling processes. Whether
   ENSO drives the intensity of localised, abrupt, intermittent upwelling
   is less well known. To explore this relationship, we used an index of
   localised, extreme (>2 ?C anomaly), intermittent upwelling intensity,
   derived from in situ sea temperature data within the Tsitsikamma
   National Park Marine Protected Area, and quantified the relationship
   between annual cumulative upwelling intensities (1991?2013) with an
   annual ENSO index, namely the Southern Oscillation Index. We found that
   ENSO phase state modulates the cumulative intensity of extreme
   intermittent upwelling events during an annual period, with more and
   greater events during La Ni?a phases compared with El Ni?o phases.
   Furthermore, these extreme upwelling events have increased with time
   along South Africa?s south coast as ENSO phase state becomes more
   intense and variable. Our findings support the emerging notion that the
   biological effects of climate change may be manifested through increased
   environmental variability rather than long-term mean environmental
   changes as ENSO is predicted to remain the dominant driver of local
   climate patterns in the future.

AB We report an abnormal slowdown of the longitudinal diffusion of F-actin
   across the isotropic-to-nematic phase transition region. To probe the
   underlying physics of this counterintuitive discovery, we compared the
   diffusion of F-actin, microtubules and fd virus in F-actin solutions
   across the transition region and found the F-actin diffusion markedly
   different from the other two filament types. Also, the viscous drag
   probed by F-actin was found to increase sharply with [Mg2+] in the
   nematic but not in the isotropic state. Based on the experimental
   results, we propose that the abnormal slowdown is caused by the weak
   electrostatic attraction between actin filaments in the nematic phase,
   in which neighboring filaments in parallel associate with each other
   transiently as they collide due to thermal fluctuations.

AB Altitudinal changes in traits and genetic markers can complement the
   studies on latitudinal patterns and provide evidence of natural
   selection because of climatic factors. In Drosophila melanogaster,
   latitudinal variation is well known but altitudinal patterns have rarely
   been investigated. Here, we examine five traits and five genetic markers
   on chromosome 3R in D. melanogaster collected at high and low altitudes
   from five latitudes along the eastern coast of Australia. Significant
   altitudinal differentiation was observed for cold tolerance, development
   time, ovariole number in unmated females, and the microsatellite marker
   DMU25686. Differences tended to match latitudinal patterns, in that
   trait values at high altitudes were also found at high latitudes,
   suggesting that factors linked to temperature are likely selective
   agents. Cold tolerance was closely associated with average temperature
   and other climatic factors, but no significant associations were
   detected for the other traits. Genes around DMU25686 represent good
   candidates for climatic adaptation.

AB Cytoskeletal polymers play a fundamental role in the responses of cells
   to both external and internal stresses. Quantitative knowledge of the
   mechanical properties of those polymers is essential for developing
   predictive models of cell mechanics and mechano-sensing. Linear
   cytoskeletal polymers, such as actin filaments and microtubules, can
   grow to cellular length scales at which they behave as semiflexible
   polymers that undergo thermally-driven shape deformations. Bending
   deformations are often modeled using the wormlike chain model. A
   quantitative metric of a polymer's resistance to bending is the
   persistence length, the fundamental parameter of that model. A polymer's
   bending persistence length is extracted from its shape as visualized
   using various imaging techniques. However, the analysis methodologies
   required for determining the persistence length are often not readily
   within reach of most biological researchers or educators. Motivated by
   that limitation, we developed user-friendly, multi-platform compatible
   software to determine the bending persistence length from images of
   surface-adsorbed or freely fluctuating polymers. Three different types
   of analysis are available (cosine correlation, end-to-end and
   bending-mode analyses), allowing for rigorous cross-checking of analysis
   results. The software is freely available and we provide sample data of
   adsorbed and fluctuating filaments and expected analysis results for
   educational and tutorial purposes.

AB In temperate climates, the recurring seasonal exigencies of winter
   represent a fundamental physiological challenge for a wide range of
   organisms. In response, many temperate insects enter diapause, an
   alternative developmental program, including developmental arrest, that
   allows organisms to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal
   environmental variation. Geographic variation in diapause phenology
   contributing to local climatic adaptation is well documented. However,
   few studies have examined how the rapid evolution of a suite of traits
   expressed across the diapause program may contribute to climatic
   adaptation on a contemporary timescale. Here, we investigate the
   evolution of the diapause program over the past 35 years by leveraging a
   "natural experiment" presented by the recent invasion of the Asian tiger
   mosquito,Aedes albopictus, across the eastern United States. We sampled
   populations from two distinct climatic regions separated by 6 degrees of
   latitude (similar to 700 km). Using common-garden experiments, we
   identified regional genetic divergence in diapause-associated cold
   tolerance, diapause duration, and postdiapause starvation tolerance. We
   also found regional divergence in nondiapause thermal performance. In
   contrast, we observed minimal regional divergence in nondiapause larval
   growth traits and at neutral molecular marker loci. Our results
   demonstrate rapid evolution of the diapause program and imply strong
   selection caused by differences in winter conditions.

   an inland common garden (Pullman, Wash.). In contrast, clones from
   inland populations grown in an inland common garden had 50% less injury
   in laboratory tests compared with the same clones grown in a coastal
   common garden. Freezing tolerance also varied between coastal
   populations. In field tests at the inland common garden, clones from
   inland and montane populations had less freezing injury compared with
   clones from coastal populations. Leaves on 50% of the clones with
   coastal origins were killed by the first fall frosts compared with 25%
   for clones with inland origins. Subsequently, 50% of the coastal clones
   exhibited winter injury following the winters of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995
   at the inland common garden. Clones from inland populations exhibited
   little or no winter injury. The specific tissues injured during freezing
   tests varied among clones. Populus trichocarpa is a species offering
   considerable variation for selection to local environments, and
   therefore, the source of material should be an important consideration
   in hybrid poplar breeding programs.

   exhibiting different levels of serotiny. Three sites were sampled, each
   of which had two of the following levels of fire severity: combusted
   crown, scorched crown and unaffected crown. Viable seed rain was closed
   related to the canopy cone bank and stand serotiny level. Soil burn
   severity also favoured seed dispersal. Relative germination success
   increased with soil burn severity whereas initial and final seedling
   density depended on both the canopy cone bank and soil burn severity. A
   positive influence of fire severity on the final/initial seedling
   density and final density/total seed dispersal ratios was also observed.
   Different post-fire management options were used at each experimental
   site following local operational routines. Harvesting and slash logging
   resulted in significantly higher seedling mortality. However, at the end
   of the study period, seedling density in all stands was sufficient to
   ensure re-establishment of A pinaster forest. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Effective adaptation of forest management practices to climate change
   will require a good understanding of the ecological and climatic factors
   influencing tree sensitivities and responses to climate. Using tree-ring
   data collected from 33 stands of mature interior Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) spanning a wide climatic range in
   British Columbia (BC), Canada, we present an approach combining
   high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data with traditional
   dendroecological analyses to quantify relationships between population
   climate-growth sensitivity and provenance (i.e., seed-source origin)
   climate. Key results showed that Douglas-fir climate-growth
   sensitivities were strongly linked to provenance climate and varied in
   coherent patterns across climatic gradients. Climate-growth
   sensitivities and responses were sometimes opposite between provenances
   from disparate climates. Perhaps most importantly, our results showed
   that Douglas-fir productivity across most of its range was sensitive to
   moisture limitations, and this sensitivity increased strongly with
   decreasing provenance mean annual precipitation and increasing
   heat-moisture index. Using geographic information systems, we visualize
   the link between provenance mean annual precipitation and climatic
   sensitivity of Douglas-fir across BC to identify "high risk"
   populations. By understanding the link between biological responses and
   climate, forest managers may be able to spatially identify sensitive
   populations using spatiotemporal climate data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two different datasets were analyzed in order to clarify the factors
   that affect regeneration success of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and
   Norway spruce (Picea abies) in the climatically extreme areas in
   northern Finland. First, pine seed maturity and the number of cones in
   the trees were investigated at five pairs of study sites during the
   period 1997-2003. Secondly, the rate of seedling establishment and
   seedling survival of Scots pine and Norway spruce were monitored and
   compared among three different timberline zones (forest zone,
   timberline, tree line) in 13 localities during the period 1983-1999. The
   first study showed that both cone production (bud formation) and seed
   maturity may be limiting factors for successful reproduction in the
   climatically marginal habitats. Seed maturity correlated well with the
   temperature sum of the summer, but variation in the number of cones had
   a periodic component rather than strictly following the temperature sum
   of the summer of bud formation. Monitoring surveys since 1983 showed
   that pine and spruce regenerated more or less regularly in all the zones
   during 1983-1999. However, seedling mortality of pines was much higher
   compared to spruce. In general, initially small sized seedlings showed
   higher mortality compared with larger ones. The results suggest that
   besides restrictions in reproduction, stand dynamics in the timberline
   habitats are strongly controlled by seedling mortality due to a variety
   of causes.

AB If phenotypic plasticity is a trait subject to selection and evolution,
   we need to quantify reaction norms and to identify the potential
   target(s) of selection. Previously we proposed the use of polynomial
   coefficients as reaction norm descriptors. However, the interpretation
   of these coefficients is not straightforward if the reaction norm is not
   linear. Therefore, we instead propose the use of characteristic values
   to describe reaction norms. We depict such characteristic values for
   linear, quadratic, and logistic reaction norms, discuss how they might
   evolve, and illustrate their estimation using data on abdominal
   pigmentation of Drosophila simulans.

AB We determined the efficiency of thermoregulation by the Southernmost
   liolaemids Liolaemus sarmientoi and L. magellanicus from Patagonia,
   Argentina (51 degrees S), by measuring body (T-b), microenvironmental,
   and operative temperatures in the field, and preferred body temperatures
   in the laboratory (T-pref). L. sarmientoi was found to be a poor
   thermoregulator, whereas L. magellanicus was deemed to be a constrained
   thermoconformer. Among all known species of Lioloemus, L. sarmientoi and
   L. magellonicus had the lowest T-b.s when tested in the field; however,
   their T-b.s were similar to other liolaemids. These data suggest that
   these southernmost liolaemid species have not evolved appropriate
   thermoregulatory behaviors or made adequate physiological adaptations to
   face the extreme thermal challenges of their environment. (C) 2009

AB Diurnal-period internal waves were observed near Point Conception
   California, using an array of moorings extending 120 km along the inner
   shelf. The waves have an along-shelf coherence scale of at least 50 km,
   and appear to propagate nearly straight onshore. Wave amplitudes vary
   over time, depending on thermal stratification and the amplitude of the
   diurnal sea breeze oscillation. Barotropic tides and vorticity over the
   mid-shelf are not correlated with internal wave amplitude. Large
   amplitude internal waves, with supercritical Froude numbers, are
   observed in mid-summer. Although such waves may drive vertical mixing
   and cross-shelf transport of passive particles, there is no significant
   correlation between wave amplitude and invertebrate settlement in the

AB In situ edaphic factors affecting seed germination and seedling
   emergence of three framework species of Acacia were investigated with
   the intent of developing fundamental and scalable restoration capacity
   for Arabian dryland restoration. Direct seeding represents the most
   efficient means to restore vegetation at the landscape scale and this
   study provides insight into edaphic and ecological limitations, as well
   as effective protocols governing the use of native seeds for restoration
   in hyper-arid environments. The study was conducted in extant Acacia
   woodland habitat on conserved land (Thumamah Nature Park) in close
   proximity to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Broad-scale direct seeding using un-
   and pretreated Acacia gerrardii, A. tortilis, and A. ehrenbergiana seed,
   and two seed burial depths were implemented across three sites with
   distinct soil surface characteristics. Eight weeks post-sowing, random
   samples for each species x seed treatment x burial depth combination
   were excavated, sieved, and categorized as follows: failed to germinate,
   germinated but died prior to emerging, or successfully emerged. We show
   that germination and emergence of Acacia gerrardii, A. tortilis, and A.
   ehrenbergiana were driven by a three-way interaction among species,
   site, and seed burial depth. Treating seed with the signaling compound
   Moddus did not have a definitive effect, positive or negative, on any of
   the species investigated. Acacia gerrardii was the only species that
   exhibited widespread emergence, though emergence was not consistent
   across sites or burial depths. Germination was highest in disturbed soil
   (up to 69% for A. gerrardii), but very few (< 2%) successfully emerged;
   a greater proportion of germinants in sandy soil emerged (up to 44% for
   A. gerrardii) even though the overall germination was less. Though
   species-dependent, a 2-cm sowing depth was most effective in sand; while
   in disturbed soil, sowing depths of 1 and 2 cm were comparable; and no
   germination was observed in gravelly clay soil. Sandy soil exhibited
   rapid water infiltration (107.6 mm min(-1)), and post-sowing surface
   crusting was a non-factor (0.44 kg cm(-2)). Disturbed soil exhibited
   moderate water infiltration (1.46 mm min(-1)) and post-sowing surface
   crusting was double that of sand (0.88 kg cm(-2)) and restrictive on
   seedling emergence. Gravelly clay exhibited extremely poor water
   infiltration (0.12 mm min(-1)), and surface crusting was severe (4.49 kg
   cm(-2)) and an order of magnitude greater than sand. The medium-coarse
   sand fraction, a key driver of the observed soil surface processes, was
   greatest in sand (55%) and significantly less and uniform in the
   disturbed (22%) and gravelly clay (22%) soils. Our findings demonstrate
   that soil surface characteristics and associated processes can dictate
   ecological processes at depths as shallow as 1-2 cm, and that soil
   crusts that slow water infiltration and impede seedling emergence
   rapidly reconstitute after disturbance; both are important
   considerations for restoring dryland vegetation.

AB Striga hermonthica, a root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, severely
   constrains grain production in sub-Saharan Africa. Host specificity and
   geography may play important roles in shaping the population structure
   of S. hermonthica, with the Rift Valley potentially presenting a
   significant barrier to dispersal. Genetic diversity was assessed in 12
   S. hermonthica populations from locations in Ethiopia. Of these, seven
   populations were parasitic on sorghum, two each on tef and maize, and
   one on finger millet. Genetic variation was detected using four
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations. After
   correcting for repeatability, 385 fragments were detected across all
   primer combinations. The percentage of polymorphic loci was relatively
   high, ranging from 53.2% to 76.4%. Expected heterozygosity ranged from
   0.168 to 0.279. Genetic differentiation between populations was
   relatively high, and all populations were significantly different from
   each other. FST values ranged from 0.032 to 0.293 and averaged 0.146.
   Genetic differences between populations could not be attributed to host
   specificity. Instead, geography was the main determinant of population
   structure. There was a correlation between geographic and genetic
   distance. A significant portion of the genetic variance could be
   apportioned on either side of the Rift Valley (5%; P = 0.001). Also, a
   significant geographic barrier was identified in the southern portion of
   the sampled region.

AB The seaweed Cladophoropsis membranacea (Hofman Bang ex. C. Agardh)
   Borgesen is a widely distributed species on coral reefs and along rocky
   coastlines throughout the tropics and subtropics. In a recent
   population-level survey openface >1600 individuals with eight
   microsatellite loci, a number of isolates from biogeographically
   disjunct locations could not be amplified for any of the loci.
   Nonamplifiable and amplifiable isolates co-occurred within the Canary
   Islands, Cape Verde Islands, and in the Caribbean. These unexpected
   results led to question whether or not C. membranacea is a single
   species. Phylogenetic relationships were evaluated using rDNA ITS1 and
   ITS2 sequence comparisons from 42 isolates sampled from a subset of 30
   of the 66 locations. Four well-supported clades were identified.
   Sequence divergence within clades was <1%, whereas between-clade
   divergence was 2%-3%. Intraindividual variation was extremely low with
   no effects on the analysis. A strong, but imperfect, correspondence was
   found between ITS clades and amplifiable microsatellite loci. It is
   concluded that C. membranacea consists of three cryptic species. Using
   Pacific isolates as an outgroup, the most basal clade included the
   Central Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Bonaire (Caribbean) isolates and
   thus spanned the widest latitude. Two derived sister clades consisted of
   a southern transtropical group stretching across the SE Caribbean to the
   Cape Verde Islands and African coast (but not the Canary Islands) and a
   NE-Canary Island-Mediterranean clade that also included the Red Sea. The
   detection of overlapping biogeographic distributions highlights the
   importance of ecotypic differentiation with respect to temperature and
   the importance of shifting sea surface isotherms that have driven
   periodic extinctions and recolonizations of the Canary Islands-a
   crossroads of marine floral exchange-since the last glacial maximum.

   hatched at 12 degrees C, no larvae were capable of developing to adult
   stage. At 16 degrees C, survival rate was low (4%) and prepupal stage
   lasted 101.68 +/- 11.03 d. Larvae completed development through six
   stadia at 16, 30, and 32 degrees C. Developmental time of overall
   immature stages varied from 46.62 d at 20 degrees C to 22.04 d at 30
   degrees C and increased at 32 degrees C. The lower temperature
   thresholds of 10.30 and 11.22 degrees C, and thermal constants of 429.18
   and 401.88 DD were estimated by traditional and Ikemoto Takai linear
   models, respectively. The Tmin values estimated by Analytis, Briere 2,

   stages were 12.40, 12.92, 9.00, and 13.04 degrees C, respectively. The
   fastest development temperatures (T-fast) of 31.1, 31.1, 30.8, and 30.7
   degrees C were estimated for overall immature stages based on Analytis,

   temperature (T-opt) estimated from the thermodynamic SSI model for total

AB A regional evaluation of the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics for the
   chernozem zone in northern Kazakhstan is now vitally important for
   agricultural and environmental policy making. The objectives of the
   present study were: (1) to predict spatial and temporal variability in C
   input as crop residues using multi-temporal MODIS satellite images, (2)
   to clarify spatial and temporal variability in CO2 emission as SOC
   output using geostatistics and model equations, (3) to clarify spatial
   and temporal variability in the SOC budget using the results from (1)
   and (2). The mean growing-season C input as plant residues in cereal
   fields ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 Mg C ha(-1), with higher values in wet
   years. Carbon input as plant residues was higher in the northern part of
   the area than in the other parts. The average growing-season CO2
   emission ranged from 0.9 to 1.1 Mg C ha(-1), and was also higher in wet
   years than in dry years. In addition, more CO2 was emitted in the
   northern part of this area. Accordingly the average growing-season C
   budget ranged from -0.2 to 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) and showed a negative
   correlation with air temperature during the crop-growing season. The
   5-year C budget for different crop rotation systems ranged from -1.0
   (3-year cropped cereal with 2-year bare fallow) to 0.4 (5-year
   continuous cereal cropped) Mg C ha(-1). These results indicate that
   fallow-based crop rotation systems are degradative with regard to the
   SOC budget in the studied area.

AB Wing shape variation was analysed with geometric morphometric methods in
   17 laboratory strains, representing 11 closely related species
   (including two subspecies) of the Drosophila virilis group: D. virilis,
   D. lummei, D. novamexicana, D. americana americana, D. americana texana,
   D. montana, D. lacicola, D. flavomontana, D. borealis, D. littoralis, D.
   ezoana and D. kanekoi. Overall shape estimated using Procrustes
   coordinates of 14 landmarks was highly variable among strains and very
   similar in females and males. The landmarks in the distal part of the
   wing showed higher variation across strains than those in the proximal
   part. Procrustes distances between species were not consistent with
   phylogenetic distances previously suggested for the virilis group.
   Moreover, Procrustes distances between strains within species and within
   two major phylads (virilis and montana) were comparable with those
   between species and between phylads, respectively. The most different
   from other members of the group was the endemic D. kanekoi species,
   currently viewed as separate subphylad within the montana phylad.
   Allometric effects were found to be partly responsible for shape
   differences between the strains. Three most significant shape
   transformations were considered using the relative warp analysis and the
   strains were ordinated in accordance with transformation values. The
   pattern of relative warp scores could be easily interpreted only for the
   third warp explaining about 13% of shape variation. It separated the
   largest species, D. montana, D. ezoana and D. kanekoi, from other ones
   and was mainly associated with shape changes in the proximal region of
   the wing. The results of the present work suggest that wing shape in the
   virilis species group is not related to the speciation process. The
   observed proximal-distal contrasts and allometric effects are in
   agreement with data of other studies, in which wing shape variation was
   analysed within Drosophila species.

AB Aims Exotic invasive species are often exposed to strong selection
   pressures in their new ranges that can often lead to substantial
   intraspecific variation. Population differentiation in the timing of
   life history events in response to climate gradients is thought to be an
   important mechanism facilitating the range expansion of many invasive
   species. For seed producing plants, the timing of seed germination
   determines the first environmental conditions experienced by newly
   emerged germinates, and can have important implications for the
   successful colonization, establishment and spread of invasive plants
   though the role of germination in the success of invasive plants remains
   poorly understood.
   Methods We assessed the variation in seed germination dynamics among 10
   populations of the invasive plant Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense)
   across its North American distribution, capturing both a temperature and
   precipitation gradient, and whether that variation is associated with
   home climate. Seeds were exposed to a wide range of temperatures (11-48
   degrees C) and two water availability treatments.
   Important Findings We found that Johnsongrass seeds germinated across a
   wide range of temperatures, but there was substantial variation among
   populations in the proportion of seeds that germinated in response to
   both temperature and water availability. Evidence indicates that as
   Johnsongrass expanded its range from warmer climates into cooler
   climates, there was a concurrent shift in the germination temperature
   niche to cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that the germination
   of Johnsongrass seeds has adapted to home climate allowing this invader
   to maximize germination throughout its range, and that this may be an
   important contributing factor to its invasion into new environments.

AB Through niche construction, organisms modify their environments in ways
   that can alter how selection acts on themselves and their offspring.
   However, the role of niche construction in shaping developmental and
   evolutionary trajectories, and its importance for population divergences
   and local adaptation, remains largely unclear. In this study, we
   manipulated both maternal and larval niche construction and measured the
   effects on fitness-relevant traits in two rapidly diverging populations
   of the bull-headed dung beetle,Onthophagus taurus. We find that both
   types of niche construction enhance adult size, peak larval mass, and
   pupal mass, which when compromised lead to a synergistic decrease in
   survival. Furthermore, for one measure, duration of larval development,
   we find that the two populations have diverged in their reliance on
   niche construction: larval niche construction appears to buffer against
   compromised maternal niche construction only in beetles from Western
   Australia, but not in beetles from the Eastern United States. We discuss
   our results in the context of rapid adaptation to novel conditions and
   the role of niche construction therein.

AB Nest morphology can affect the breeding success of birds. Thus, birds
   inhabiting different environments may experience divergent selection for
   nest structure and composition that results in intraspecific geographic
   variation in nest architecture. We describe interpopulation differences
   in nest architecture among Thorn-tailed Rayaditos (Aphrastura
   spinicauda) in 2 contrasting environments near the species' distribution
   limits: a temperate and very humid environment in north-central Chile
   (the forest relicts of Fray Jorge National Park; 30 degrees 38'S, 71
   degrees 40'W) and a cold and windy sub-Antarctic environment in the
   south of Chile (Isla Navarino; 55840S, 67 degrees 40'W). We collected a
   total of 62 nests from Fray Jorge and 61 nests from Navarino in 2013 and
   2014, measured their dimensions, and quantified their constitutive
   materials. We tested the nests' thermal properties (simulating heat loss
   by convection and conduction) and hygroscopic features (water absorption
   and water loss capacity) and used general linear models to (1) compare
   these properties between populations and (2) test for a relationship
   between nest morphology and function. Nests from the northern population
   exhibited lower rates of heat loss by convection because they were
   larger and had a lower ratio of surface area to volume; these nests also
   absorbed less water, probably because of their greater content of
   plant-derived materials. In the southern population, nests were more
   compact and better insulated with feathers and hairs, with lower rates
   of heat loss by conduction. By separately analyzing the roles of
   convection, conduction, and humidity, our results suggest that potential
   trade-offs (insulation-humidity) could be differently affecting the
   nestbuilding behavior of these populations. Therefore, Thorn-tailed

AB 1. Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian
   Ocean were obtained from catches (303 239), sightings (4383 records of
   >= 8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries
   (95), and acoustic recordings.
   2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14 676 days
   with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales
   (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated
   individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000
   km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were
   lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical
   Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and
   Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia
   and south of Madagascar.
   3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian,
   Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton
   densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes
   like upwelling and frontal meandering.
   4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic ('true') subspecies
   is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack
   ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they
   migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare)
   and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some
   overwinter in the Antarctic.
   5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern
   Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern
   Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western
   and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator.
   Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales.
   6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and high
   sighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to
   clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics,
   acoustics and length frequencies.
   7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860-2900)
   in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3%
   per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4-11.6%). The status of other
   populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is
   unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent
   sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue
   whales.

AB 1. A 2-year (2002-2003) survey of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments is
   reported for two off-shore stations of Lake Tanganyika, Kigoma
   (Tanzania) and Mpulungu (Zambia), and from three cruises between those
   sites. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (0.3-3.4 mg m(-3)) and
   average chlorophyll a integrated through the 100 m water column were
   similar for both stations and years (36.4-41.3 mg m(-2)). Most pigments
   were located in the 0-60 m layer and decreased sharply downward.
   Chlorophyll a degradation products (phaeophytins and phaeophorbides)
   were detected at 100 m depth, whereas carotenoids became undetectable.
   Temporal and seasonal variation of the vertical distribution of pigments
   was high.
   2. The biomass of phytoplankton groups was calculated from marker
   pigment concentrations over the 0-100 m water column using the CHEMTAX
   software. On average for the study period, chlorophytes dominated in the
   northern station, followed by cyanobacteria T1 (type 1, or Synechococcus
   pigment type), whereas cyanobacteria T1 dominated in the south.
   Cyanobacteria T2 (type 2, containing echinenone), presumably
   corresponding to filamentous taxa, were detected in the rainy season.
   Diatoms (and chrysophytes) developed better in the dry season
   conditions, with a deep mixed layer and increased nutrient availability.
   Very large variation in the vertical distribution of algal groups was
   observed.
   3. Our observations on phytoplankton composition are broadly consistent
   with those from previous studies. Our pigment data provide evidence for
   the lake-wide importance of picocyanobacteria and high interannual
   variation and spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton in Lake Tanganyika,
   which may render difficult assessment of long-term changes in
   phytoplankton driven by climate change.

AB Seed and seedling traits related to germination and stand establishment
   are important in the production of cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa
   L.). Six seed and seedling traits segregating in a L. sativa cv. Salinas
   x L. serriola recombinant inbred line population consisting of 103 F8
   families revealed a total of 17 significant quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) resulting from three seed production environments. Significant QTL
   were identified for germination in darkness, germination at 25 and 35
   degrees C, median maximum temperature of germination, hypocotyl length
   at 72 h post-imbibition, and plant (seedling) quality. Some QTL for
   germination and early seedling growth characteristics were co-located,
   suggestive of pleiotropic loci regulating these traits. A single QTL
   (Htg6.1) described 25 and 23% of the total phenotypic variation for high
   temperature germination in California- and Netherlands-grown
   populations, respectively, and was significant between 33 and 37 degrees
   C. Additionally, Htg6.1 showed significant epistatic interactions with
   other Htg QTL and a consistent effect across all the three seed
   production environments. L. serriola alleles increased germination at
   these QTL. The estimate of narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) of Htg6.1
   was 0.84, indicating potential for L. serriola as a source of
   germination thermotolerance for lettuce introgression programs.

AB Faster life histories are correlated with greater invasion success
   across taxa. However, comparisons of life-history traits across native
   and invasive ranges are rare, and thus it is unknown whether invasions
   lead directly to evolutionary shifts in life histories. Here we compare
   life history traits of three invasive populations of brown anoles (
   Anolis sagrei) to a representative native population. In a common
   garden, we measured a number of reproductive traits, including
   egg-laying rate and incubation period. We hypothesized that invasive
   populations would exhibit faster reproduction because fast life
   histories are favoured both by the invasion itself and by shorter
   breeding seasons in the invasive range. Compared with native females,
   invasive females had shorter interlaying intervals and produced eggs
   that hatched more quickly. Invasive and native populations did not
   differ consistently in egg size, hatching success or hatchling size. Our
   results indicate that life history traits have rapidly diverged during
   the brown anole invasion, potentially facilitating the successful
   establishment and expansion of the range of the species.

AB Background: Many studies have found associations between climatic
   conditions and dengue transmission. However, there is a debate about the
   future impacts of climate change on dengue transmission. This paper
   reviewed epidemiological evidence on the relationship between climate
   and dengue with a focus on quantitative methods for assessing the
   potential impacts of climate change on global dengue transmission.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted in October 2012, using the
   electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Web of
   Science. The search focused on peer-reviewed journal articles published
   in English from January 1991 through October 2012.
   Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and most studies
   showed that the transmission of dengue is highly sensitive to climatic
   conditions, especially temperature, rainfall and relative humidity.
   Studies on the potential impacts of climate change on dengue indicate
   increased climatic suitability for transmission and an expansion of the
   geographic regions at risk during this century. A variety of
   quantitative modelling approaches were used in the studies. Several key
   methodological issues and current knowledge gaps were identified through
   this review.
   Conclusions: It is important to assemble spatio-temporal patterns of
   dengue transmission compatible with long-term data on climate and other
   socio-ecological changes and this would advance projections of dengue
   risks associated with climate change.

AB Many varieties of wheat (Triticum spp.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
   require prolonged exposure to cold during winter in order to flower
   (vernalization). In these cereals, vernalization-induced flowering is
   controlled by the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) gene. VRN1 is a promoter of
   flowering that is activated by low temperatures. VRN1 transcript levels
   increase gradually during vernalization, with longer cold treatments
   inducing higher expression levels. Elevated VRN1 expression is
   maintained in the shoot apex and leaves after vernalization, and the
   level of VRN1 expression in these organs determines how rapidly
   vernalized plants flower. Some alleles of VRN1 are expressed without
   vernalization due to deletions or insertions within the promoter or
   first intron of the VRN1 gene. Varieties of wheat and barley with these
   alleles flower without vernalization and are grown where vernalization
   does not occur. The first intron of the VRN1 locus has histone
   modifications typically associated with the maintenance of an inactive
   chromatin state, suggesting this region is targeted by epigenetic
   mechanisms that contribute to repression of VRN1 before winter. Other
   mechanisms are likely to act elsewhere in the VRN1 gene to mediate
   low-temperature induction. This review examines how understanding the
   mechanisms that regulate VRN1 provides insights into the biology of
   vernalization-induced flowering in cereals and how this will contribute
   to future cereal breeding strategies.

   activity was increased when endosperms were developed under lower
   temperature in low- and medium-amylose cultivars, while this was not the
   case for high-amylose cultivars. Amylose content in high-amylose
   cultivars was stable under different temperature, with varying GBSS
   activity. A nearly linear correlation between GBSS activity and amylose
   content was observed as far as activity levels about 250 nmol min(-1)
   g(-1) DW. These results suggest that GBSS activity is an important

AB Twenty-one species of lizards are included in the southernmost clade of
   South America, the Liolaemus lineomaculatus section. There are two
   hypotheses of species-grouping within this section, one based on
   morphological similarities and the other based on molecular phylogenetic
   relationships; although discordant, both are in use. The morphological
   arrangement hypothesis', which sorts the species of the section in three
   groups, was proposed approximate to 30 years ago; however, despite
   taxonomic changes and almost doubling the species diversity of this
   section since then, the hypothesis has never been tested. Here, we (1)
   present an updated chronological review of taxonomic changes, species
   descriptions, morphological groups, and genetic clades proposed for the
   L.lineomaculatus section, and (2) evaluate the accuracy of the
   morphological arrangement hypothesis'. We show that the traditional
   practice of classifying 11 of these species in two of the three
   traditional morphological groups of the section (Liolaemus kingii and
   Liolaemus archeforus), which is not supported by molecular data, is also
   not supported by morphological data, and therefore should be abandoned;
   we suggest referring to this group of species as the L.kingii group. We
   characterized the Liolaemus magellanicus group based on morphology, and
   extend the previously published morphological characteristics of the
   L.lineomaculatus group. Finally, we comment on future prospects for
   studies of sexual dimorphism and its possible ecological implications.
   This paper provides a critical synthesis of our understanding of the
   morphological and phylogenetic patterns within the L.lineomaculatus
   section and presents a useful framework for future tests of taxonomic
   hypotheses and physiological, behavioural, and evolutionary questions
   within this section. (c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London

AB The Gulf of Maine, NW Atlantic Ocean, is a productive, seasonal foraging
   ground for Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), but commercial
   landings of adult size classes were up to 40% below the allocated total
   allowable catch between 2004 to 2008 for the rod and reel, harpoon, and
   purse seine categories in the Gulf of Maine. Reduction in Atlantic
   bluefin tuna catches in the Gulf of Maine could represent a decline in
   spawning stock biomass, but given wide-ranging, complex migration
   patterns, and high energetic requirements, an alternative hypothesis is
   that their dispersal patterns shifted to regions with higher prey
   abundance or profitability, reducing availability to U. S. fishing
   fleets. This study fit generalized linear models to Atlantic bluefin
   tuna landings data collected from fishermen's logbooks (1979-2005) as
   well as the distances between bluefin tuna schools and Atlantic herring
   (Clupea harengus), a primary prey species, to test alternative
   hypotheses for observed shifts in Atlantic bluefin tuna availability in
   the Gulf of Maine. For the bluefin model, landings varied by day of
   year, latitude and longitude. The effect of latitude differed by day of
   year and the effect of longitude differed by year. The distances between
   Atlantic bluefin tuna schools and Atlantic herring schools were
   significantly smaller (p<0.05) than would be expected from a randomly
   distributed population. A time series of average bluefin tuna school
   positions was positively correlated with the average number of herring
   captured per tow on Georges Bank in spring and autumn surveys
   respectively (p<0.01, r(2)=0.24, p<0.01, r(2)=0.42). Fishermen's
   logbooks contributed novel spatial and temporal information towards
   testing these hypotheses for the bluefin tuna fishery.

AB Investigating the physiological mechanisms of closely related species
   that exhibit distinct geographic distributions and thermal niches is
   essential for understanding their thermal tolerance capacities and local
   adaptations in view of climate warming. The variations in upper thermal
   limits (LT50) under acute heat shock and cardiac activity, standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), anaerobic metabolite production and molecular
   responses (expression of molecular chaperones and glycolysis metabolism
   genes) under increasing temperatures in two oyster subspecies were
   studied. The populations of two oyster subspecies, Crassostrea gigas
   gigas and C. gigas angulata, exhibit different latitudinal distributions
   along the northern and southern coastlines of China, respectively, which
   experience different environmental conditions. The LT50 was
   significantly higher, by similar to 1 degrees C, in the southern than in
   the northern oysters. In both subspecies, temperature increases had
   powerful effects on heart rate, SMR and gene expression. The southern
   oysters had the highest Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures for heart rate
   (31.4 +/- 0.17 degrees C) and SMR (33.09 degrees C), whereas the heart
   rate (28.86 +/- 0.3 degrees C) and SMR (29.22 degrees C) of the northern
   oysters were lower. The same patterns were observed for the Q(10)
   coefficients. More thermal sensitivity was observed in the northern
   oysters than in their southern counterparts, as the heat-shock proteins
   (HSPs) in the northern oysters were expressed first and had a higher
   induction at a lower temperature than those of southern oysters.
   Furthermore, different expression patterns of energetic metabolism genes
   (HK, PK, and PEPCK) were observed. In the northern oysters, increasing
   anaerobic glycolysis genes (PEPCK) and end products (succinate) were
   found at 36-43 degrees C, indicating a transition from aerobic to
   anaerobic metabolism and a lower aerobic scope compared with the
   southern oysters. These two subspecies experience different
   environmental conditions, and their physiological performances suggested
   species-specific thermal tolerance windows in which the southern
   oysters, with mild physiological flexibility, had a higher potential
   capability to withstand heat stress. Overall, our results indicate that
   comparing and unifying physiological and molecular mechanisms can
   provide a framework for understanding the likely effects of global
   warming on marine ectotherms in intertidal regions.

   niger, H. foetidus were examined throughout a two-year period in order
   to determine the variation of lipid content and fatty acid composition
   during the ontogenetic cycle. In the deciduous geophytes H. viridis and
   H. odorus subsp. laxus the lipid content reaches its maximum during the
   quiescent phase, whereas in the evergreen geophyte H. niger the lipid
   content is highest during the main growth period. In the chamaephyte H.
   foetidus lipid content is always very low and it does not show variation
   throughout the year. In all species the fatty acids detected in the
   neutral fraction are myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic
   acid. Palmitic and linoleic acid are always present in larger
   quantities. The pattern of the relative content of saturated/unsaturated
   fatty acids seems to be linked to the life form of these species.

AB Despite advances in molecular systematics, the taxonomy of tardigrades
   still depends largely on morphological and morphometric traits. The fact
   that the variability of any biological trait is determined by the
   interaction between genetics and environment prompts a very fundamental
   question: is it possible for tardigrades of the same genotype, but
   originating from various habitats that differ in environmental
   conditions, to have phenotypes so different that they would be
   erroneously classified as different species taxa by means of classical
   taxonomy? Here, we present the results of a broad and fully controlled
   laboratory experiment in which we investigated the phenotypic plasticity
   of a number of traits that are traditionally considered to be
   taxonomically important. In order to achieve this, we have cultured six
   tardigrade species belonging to four eutardigrade families (Milnesiidae,
   Hypsibiidae, Isohypsibiidae, and Macrobiotidae) under five experimental
   regimes, reflecting key environmental factors that are likely to vary in
   natural habitats (i.e. temperature and food availability). We then
   measured a number of key taxonomic traits and compared their dimensions
   between the treatments. Over twoyears of experimentation we have
   obtained more than 28000 morphometric measurements for over 2300
   individuals. Such an extensive data setallowed us to test some of the
   fundamental assumptions of classic tardigrade taxonomy. We found that in
   the five parachelan species analysed, the great majority of both
   absolute and relative traits differed significantly between the
   treatments, whereas there were no significant differences in the
   apochelan species. Overall, tardigrades grew largest under the
   low-temperature treatment, whereas the smallest specimens were observed
   under high-temperature and low-food regimes. However, the prevalent
   statistical significance resulted mainly from the considerable
   statistical power of our analyses, and not from effect sizes, which
   varied mostly between low and moderate. In other words, the differences,
   although consistent, were minor in terms of taxonomical significance,
   and probably would not be considered by classic taxonomists as
   sufficient to designate animals from different treatments as separate
   taxa.

AB We used a dataset assembled by the Peruvian Marine Research Institute
   (IMARPE) from 1961 to 2005, to examine the influence of seasonal,
   environmental (temperature and salinity), temporal (day-night and year)
   and location (north-south and on-off shelf) variables on the
   distribution and biovolume of zooplankton. Classification and regression
   trees (CART) showed that the zooplankton distribution can be divided
   into four time regimes: prior to 1974.5, 1974.5-1989.5, 1989.5-1997.5
   and 1997.5-2005. These periods differ in overall biovolume but, more
   importantly, in having different spatial distributions of variables.
   Offshore-onshore, seasonal, diel and north-south patterns are all
   apparent in the temporal changes observed in zooplankton distribution.
   In the early period zooplankton biovolume was high throughout the
   Peruvian Humboldt Current Ecosystem, with enhanced biovolume in all
   seasons but winter. After 1974.5, biovolume was considerably lower.
   There was an increased difference between the shelf (lower biovolume)
   and offshore (higher biovolume), with a significant day-night effect
   offshore, due to diel migration and possibly diel catchability changes.
   After 1989.5, seasonal effects were more marked and biovolume appeared
   to be higher in the winter in the northern region. In other seasons,
   during the daytime, biovolume was highest farther offshore (greater than
   65 km offshore of the 200-m isobath) and, during the night, higher after
   1997.5 than before. We relate these changes in distribution and
   biovolume to changes in large-scale current patterns in different
   regimes and to the possible effect of the fishery in removing nutrients
   from the system.

AB 1. Climate change is driving range contractions and local population
   extinctions across the globe. When this affects ecosystem engineers the
   vacant niches left behind are likely to alter the wider ecosystem unless
   a similar species can fulfil them.
   2. Here, we explore the stress physiology of two coexisting kelps
   undergoing opposing range shifts in the Northeast Atlantic and discuss
   what differences in stress physiology may mean for future niche filling.
   3. We used chlorophyll florescence (Fv/Fm) and differentiation of the
   heat shock response (HSR) to determine the capacity of the expanding
   kelp, Laminaria ochroleuca, to move into the higher shore position of
   the retreating kelp, Laminaria digitata. We applied both single and
   consecutive exposures to immersed and emersed high and low temperature
   treatments, replicating low tide exposures experienced in summer and
   winter.
   4. No interspecific differences in HSR were observed which was
   surprising given the species' different biogeographic distributions.
   However, chlorophyll florescence revealed clear differences between
   species with L. ochroleuca better equipped to tolerate high immersed
   temperatures but showed little capacity to tolerate frosts or high
   emersion temperatures.
   5. Many patterns observed were only apparent after consecutive
   exposures. Such cumulative effects have largely been overlooked in
   tolerance experiments on intertidal organisms despite being more
   representative of the stress experienced in natural habitats. We
   therefore suggest future experiments incorporate consecutive stress into
   their design.
   6. Climate change is predicted to result in fewer ground frosts and
   increased summer temperatures. Therefore, L. ochroleuca may be released
   from its summer cold limit in winter but still be prevented from moving
   up the shore due to desiccation in the summer. Laminaria ochroleuca
   will, however, likely be able to move into tidal pools. Therefore, only
   partial niche filling by L. ochroleuca will be possible in this system
   as climate change advances.

   bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis: PBF) distributions in the California
   Current system using remotely sensed environmental data, and
   fishery-dependent data from multiple fisheries in a habitat-modeling
   framework. We examined the effects of local oceanic conditions (sea
   surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height, eddy
   kinetic energy), as well as large-scale oceanographic phenomena, such as
   El Nino, on PBF availability to commercial and recreational fishing
   fleets. Results from generalized additive models showed that warmer
   temperatures of around 17-21 degrees C with low surface chlorophyll
   concentrations (<0.5 mg/m(3)) increased probability of occurrence of PBF
   in the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel and purse seine fisheries.
   These associations were particularly evident during a recent marine
   heatwave (the "Blob"). In contrast, PBF were most likely to be
   encountered on drift gillnet gear in somewhat cooler waters (13-18
   degrees C), with moderate chlorophyll concentrations (0.5-1.0 mg/m(3)).
   This discrepancy was likely a result of differing spatiotemporal
   distribution of fishing effort among fleets, as well as the different
   vertical depths fished by each gear, demonstrating the importance of
   understanding selectivity when building correlative habitat models. In
   the future, monitoring and understanding environmentally driven changes
   in the availability of PBF to commercial and recreational fisheries can
   contribute to the implementation of ecosystem approaches to fishery
   management.

AB P>We estimate probability density functions (PDFs) for future rainfall
   in five regions of South America, by weighting the predictions of the 24
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Archive Project 3 (CMIP3) General
   Circulation Models (GCMs). The models are rated according to their
   relative abilities to reproduce the inter-annual variability in seasonal
   rainfall.
   The relative weighting of the climate models is updated sequentially
   according to Bayes' theorem, based on the biases in the mean of the
   predicted time-series and the distributional fit of the bias-corrected
   time-series.
   Depending on the season and the region, we find very different rankings
   of the GCMs, with no single model doing well in all cases. However, in
   some regions and seasons, differential weighting of the models leads to
   significant shifts in the derived rainfall PDFs.
   Using a combination of the relative model weightings for each season we
   have also derived a set of overall model weightings for each region that
   can be used to produce PDFs of forest biomass from the simulations of
   the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model for managed land
   (LPJmL).

AB The network architecture of an ecological community describes the
   structure of species interactions established in a given place and time.
   It has been suggested that this architecture presents unique features
   for each type of ecological interaction: e.g., nested and modular
   architectures would correspond to mutualistic and antagonistic
   interactions, respectively. Recently, Michalska-Smith and Allesina
   (2019) proposed a computational challenge to test whether it is indeed
   possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on network
   architecture. Contrary to the expectation, they found that this
   differentiation is practically impossible, moving the question to why it
   is not possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on their
   network architecture alone. Here, we show that this differentiation
   becomes possible by adding the local environmental information where the
   networks were sampled. We show that this can be explained by the fact
   that environmental conditions are a confounder of ecological
   interactions and network architecture. That is, the lack of association
   between network architecture and type of ecological interactions changes
   by conditioning on the local environmental conditions. Additionally, we
   find that environmental conditions are linked to the stability of
   ecological networks, but the direction of this effect depends on the
   type of interaction network. This suggests that the association between
   ecological interactions and network architectures exists, but cannot be
   fully understood without attention to the environmental conditions
   acting upon them.
   Author summary
   It has been suggested that different types of species interactions lead
   to ecological networks with different architectures. For example,
   mutualistic and antagonistic interaction networks have been shown to
   have nested and modular architectures, respectively. Importantly, this
   differentiation can provide clues about the link between the dynamics
   and structures shaping ecological communities. Recently, Michalska-Smith
   and Allesina (2019) turned this assumption into a serious computational
   challenge for the scientific community. Here, we embrace this challenge.
   We confirm that network architecture alone is not enough to
   differentiate interaction networks. However, we show that network
   architectures can differentiate between mutualistic and antagonistic
   interaction networks by using information about their local
   environmental conditions. In other words, ignoring environmental
   information throws out the predictable patterns of network architectures
   along environmental gradients. Thus, this response is also a reminder
   that ecological networks may only make sense in the light of
   environmental information.

AB Seventy U-Th ages from six stalagmites from the Cordillera Cantabrica in
   northwestern Spain indicate deposition during interglacial, but not
   glacial, stages over the last 550 kyr. Stable isotope data and
   petrographic observations suggest that, within each interglacial,
   conditions typically progressed from drier to wetter. Consideration of
   the most precise U-Th ages suggests that stalagmite deposition occurred
   in times more predictable from European pollen records than from the
   global marine isotope record. For example, during the last interglacial,
   ages suggest deposition in an interval better characterized as the
   Eemian, as opposed to MIS 5e, and during the St. Germain I or MIS 5c
   interval. The same holds for MIS 7, where ages suggest deposition during
   MIS 7a and MIS 7c but not MIS 7e. These age ranges for interglacials,
   consistently later than those suggested by the benthic marine record,
   are compatible with warm conditions maintained by thermohaline
   circulation that simultaneously supplied the moisture for growing ice
   sheets of the subsequent glaciation.
   Trends both within and across these six stalagmites suggest that cooler
   temperatures were associated with wetter conditions, both during
   interglacials and in conditions intermediate between interglacials and
   glacials in northern Spain. In contrast, other researchers' results from
   a stalagmite from the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent deglaciation
   suggest colder temperatures were associated with drier conditions. The
   two trends combine to suggest wettest conditions in times intermediate
   between interglacials and glacials, compatible with a model in which
   modern climatic belts from dry Arctic to wet European to dry marginal
   Saharan have moved over northern Spain in the cycle from glacial to
   interglacial times. Extrapolation to a warmer future would suggest drier
   conditions in the northern Iberian Peninsula than those of today. (C)

AB The long-range dispersal of pelagic larvae is often assumed to be the
   dominant force behind connectivity in the marine environment, with
   little consideration given to benthic movements. We analyzed data from
   an American lobster (Homarus americanus) tagging study (1980-1996) in
   the Gulf of St. Lawrence during which 37 579 adults from 14 locations
   were tagged and 6296 were recaptured after 1-6 years at large. The 10th
   percentile greatest distance moved by tagged lobsters after 1 year at
   large contributed to demographic connectivity between neighbouring
   statistical districts, fishing ports, and (in one location) management
   areas. Considering the incremental dispersal of lobsters after 2 versus
   1 year at large, we estimated that the 10th percentile greatest benthic
   dispersal distances after 1, 2, and 5 years at large represented,
   respectively, 7%,14%, and 35% of larval dispersal in the "downstream"
   direction and 75%,111%, and 220% of larval dispersal in the "upstream"
   direction (similar results obtained based on mean dispersal values). We
   conclude that more attention should be given to benthic movements in
   estimating connectivity and stock structure in American lobster.

   przewalskii in this region are able to provide common regional climate
   information. However, the chronologies at the lower forest limits showed
   a higher standard deviation and more significant correlations with
   climatic factors, suggesting that the radial growth there was more
   significantly influenced by climate variation. The first principal
   component of the four chronologies showed a common growth response to
   local climate. The second principal component showed a contrasting
   growth response between different sampling sites. The third principal
   component revealed different growth patterns in response to altitudinal
   variation. Further analysis indicated that the precipitation in late
   spring and early summer controlled the growth of S. przewalskii on a
   regional scale and that other factors, such as microenvironment at the
   sampling sites, also affected the strength of the climatic response of
   tree growth.

AB The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends
   on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as
   on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through
   phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity
   induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature
   regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance
   traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a
   constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating
   temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among
   all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both
   temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat
   tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating
   thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant
   environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when
   developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our
   surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing
   environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to
   flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably
   changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition,
   resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even
   though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the
   predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress
   resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be
   the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting,
   indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the
   predictability of the environment.

AB The seasonal dynamics of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC)
   emissions, which can be related to the formation and growth of secondary
   organic aerosols, represent an important but at the present poorly
   understood linkage between vegetation activity and climate. Although a
   close relationship between photosynthesis and terpenoid emissions has
   been proposed, high monoterpene emission rates for Scots pine shoots
   (Pinus sylvestris) are frequently recorded during spring, in times when
   photosynthetic activity is strongly inhibited due to inherent seasonal
   restrictions. We suggest that terpenoid emissions are related to either
   photosynthesis or photorespiration for precursors for terpenoid
   biosynthesis. We developed two dynamic models describing temporal
   fluctuations in Scots pine monoterpene emissions, calculating the
   emissions by using CO, exchange and ambient climate data. The models
   accurately predicted the measured monoterpene flux, and especially in
   March-April, during the time when photosynthesis was negligible and
   ambient temperatures were between -5 and + 15 degrees C, a good
   agreement was found with measured emissions and the model involving
   photorespiration.

AB Plants of the threatened seagrass, Halophila johnsonii Eiseman, from a
   riverine and marine population were exposed to a series of salinity
   treatments within mesocosms. Survival and maximum photochemical
   efficiencies of PSII (F-v/F-m) were measured in response to varied
   frequency, duration, and amplitude of hyposalinity exposures. Both
   populations exhibited high survival after two cycles of short, pulsed
   hyposalinity treatments (100% and 89%, respectively). However, two
   cycles of long pulses of low salinity resulted in 100% mortality for
   marine H. johnsonii and >50% mortality for riverine plants. After two
   cycles of gradual salinity reduction to a salinity of 5, survival for
   marine and riverine plants was also low (22% and 33%, respectively).
   F-v/F(m)values of riverine H. johnsonii were relatively high (0.65-0.70)
   after a single short pulse or gradual reduction to salinity of 10.
   F-v/F-m values of marine plants were lower in these two treatments and
   exhibited greater declines following a single, long pulse to a salinity
   of 10 or after a single gradual reduction to a salinity of 5. F-v/F-m
   values showed riverine plants were also more resistant to repeated
   pulses of moderate low salinity than marine plants. Our results indicate
   wide tolerances of H. johnsonii to short pulses of hyposalinity, but
   suggest that repeated or prolonged hyposalinity stress at near-tolerance
   salinity levels can have additive effects on photosynthetic health and
   survival. Differences in resilience of marine and riverine H. johnsonii
   populations are consistent with previous suggestions that estuarine
   ecophenes are more tolerant to hyposalinity than marine populations.

AB The long-term effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on isoprenoid emissions
   from adult trees of two Mediterranean oak species (the
   monoterpene-emitting Quercus ilex L. and the isoprene-emitting Quercus
   pubescens Willd.) native to a high-CO2 environment was investigated.
   During two consecutive years, isoprenoid emission was monitored both at
   branch level, measuring the actual emissions under natural conditions,
   and at leaf level, measuring the basal emissions under the standard
   conditions of 30 degreesC and at light intensity of 1000 mumol m(-2)
   s(-1). Long-term exposure to high atmospheric levels of CO2 did not
   significantly affect the actual isoprenoid emissions. However, when
   leaves of plants grown in the control site were exposed for a short
   period to an elevated CO2 level by rapidly switching the CO2
   concentration in the gas-exchange cuvette, both isoprene and monoterpene
   basal emissions were clearly inhibited. These results generally confirm
   the inhibitory effect of elevated CO2 on isoprenoid emission. The
   absence of a CO2 effect on actual emissions might indicate higher leaf
   temperature at elevated CO2, or an interaction with multiple stresses
   some of which (e.g. recurrent droughts) may compensate for the CO2
   effect in Mediterranean ecosystems. Under elevated CO2, isoprene
   emission by Q. pubescens was also uncoupled from the previous day's air
   temperature. In addition, pronounced daily and seasonal variations of
   basal emission were observed under elevated CO2 underlining that
   correction factors may be necessary to improve the realistic estimation
   of isoprene emissions with empirical algorithms in the future. A
   positive linear correlation of isoprenoid emission with the
   photosynthetic electron transport and in particular with its calculated
   fraction used for isoprenoid synthesis was found. The slope of this
   relationship was different for isoprene and monoterpenes, but did not
   change when plants were grown in either ambient or elevated CO2. This
   suggests that physiological algorithms may usefully predict isoprenoid
   emission also under rising CO2 levels.

AB Eight healthy subjects exercised at 90 watts on a cycle ergometer on
   four occasions, at times close to the minimum, maximum rate of rise,
   maximum, and maximum rate of fall of their resting core temperature. The
   duration of exercise was determined by the time taken for the core
   (rectal) temperature to reach an equilibrium value. Forearm skin blood
   flow and temperature were measured regularly during the exercise, as
   were heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion. Sweat loss was
   calculated by weighing the subjects nude before and after the exercise.
   The rise of heart rate was not significantly different at the four times
   of exercise, though the rating of perceived exertion was greatest at
   05:00h. Resting core temperatures showed a significant circadian rhythm
   at rest (the timing of which confirmed that exercise was being performed
   at the required times), but the amplitude of this rhythm was decreased
   significantly by the exercise. The initial rate of rise of core
   temperature, and the total rise from the resting to the equilibrium
   value, were both inversely proportional to resting temperature. The
   time-course of the rise was accurately described by a
   negative-exponential model, but this model gave no evidence that the
   kinetics of the equilibration process depended upon the time of day. The
   thermoregulatory responses to the rise in core temperature-the amount of
   total sweat loss and rises in forearm skin blood flow and
   temperature-differed according to the time of exercise. In general, the
   responses were significantly greater at 17:00 h compared with 05:00 h,
   and at 23:00 h compared with 11:00 h. The results accord with
   predictions made on the basis of previous work by us in which core
   temperature rhythms have been separated into components due to the
   endogenous body clock and due to the direct effects of spontaneous
   activity. The results are discussed in terms of the ecological
   implications of the differing capabilities of humans to deal with heat
   loads produced by spontaneous activity or mild exercise at different
   phases of the circadian rhythm of resting core temperature.

   obtained data showed higher levels of TA and lower levels of HT in
   E-types over the whole day as compared to M-types. As for EA, M-types
   showed higher levels than E-types between 08:00 to 17:00h, but the two
   groups showed no differences during the later hours of the day. Both
   groups were found to exhibit similar diurnal patterns in TA and HT, and
   dissimilarity between M-types and E-types appeared in the daily course

AB The harsh environmental conditions of the ice-free regions of
   Continental Antarctica are considered one of the closest Martian
   analogues on Earth. There, rocks play a pivotal role as substratum for
   life and endolithism represents a primary habitat for microorganisms
   when external environmental conditions become incompatible with active
   life on rock surfaces, allowing life to spread throughout these regions
   with extreme temperatures and low water availability. Previous research
   concluded that altitude and distance from sea do not play as driving
   factors in shaping microbial abundance and diversity, while sun exposure
   was hypothesized as significant parameter influencing endolithic
   settlement and development. With this in mind, eight localities were
   visited in the Victoria Land along an altitudinal transect from 834 to
   3100 m a.s.l. and 48 differently sun-exposed rocks were collected. We
   explored our hypothesis that changes in sun exposure translate to shifts
   in community composition and abundances of main biological compartments
   (fungi, algae and bacteria) using Denaturing Gel Gradient
   Electrophoresis and quantitative PCR techniques. Major changes in
   community composition and abundance occurred between north and south
   sun-exposed samples. As Antarctic endolithic ecosystems are extremely
   adapted and specialized but scarcely resilient to external perturbation,
   any shifts in community structure may serve as early-alarm systems of
   climate change; our findings will be of wide interest for microbial
   ecologists of extreme environments such as arid and hyper-arid area.

AB The first detailed study on chaetetids from the Buckhorn Asphalt Quarry
   Lagerstatte is presented. Among the investigated specimens we found two
   samples (chaetetid specimens 2 and 6) that are different from all others
   in the quarry. Thin sections of these display a complex fragmentation of
   these Buckhorn chaetetids. Additionally, one of these samples contains
   two chaetetid morphotypes growing side by side, thus, in the same
   paleoenvironment. These specimens differ in their mode of growth
   (laminar and domical), which suggests that chaetetid growth was most
   likely influenced by genetic factors rather than by the
   paleoenvironment. We observed a feature, not hitherto reported as far as
   we are aware, on the surface of chaetetids; namely a regular clustering
   of seven tubules surrounding a central tubule. This feature could have
   had an exhalant function. Mineralogical analyses of the skeleton
   indicate primary high magnesian-calcite mineralogy, which is in
   accordance with reports in the literature. Cements precipitated during
   diagenesis are either calcite or dolomite and, where associated with
   microbial mats, they may contain a distinct amount of manganese. The
   comparison of the chaetetid skeletons from the Buckhorn Asphalt Quarry
   leads to the impression, that they represent various morphotypes or even
   species. Because of the lack of unique features, we have refrained
   however, from describing new species.

   advantageous for ectothermic organisms to prefer a body temperature
   slightly below the physiological optimum. This theory works well for
   many terrestrial organisms but has not been tested for animals
   inhabiting the hypervariable physical environment of intertidal shores.
   In laboratory experiments, we allowed the intertidal snail Chlorostoma
   funebralis to position itself on a temperature gradient, then measured
   its thermal preference and determined an index of how its performance
   varied with temperature. Snails performed a biased random walk along the
   temperature gradient, which, contrary to expectations, caused them to
   aggregate where body temperature was 15 to 17 C below their temperature
   of optimum performance and near the species' lower thermal limit. This
   "cold-biased" behavioral response may guide snails to refuges in shaded
   cracks and crevices, but potentially precludes C. funebralis from taking
   full advantage of its physiological capabilities.

   biophysical equations. We monitored the rectal temperature, as well as
   the non-evaporative (radiative and convective pathways) and evaporative
   heat exchanges of males and females. The mean rectal temperature of
   females and males was 37.58 +/- 0.02 and 37.47 +/- 0.02 degrees C,
   respectively. We identified thermal windows by infrared thermography.
   The surface temperatures and the long-wave radiation heat exchanges were
   higher in the periocular, preocular, pinnae and vibrissae regions, in
   that order. The surface temperature of the periocular and preocular
   regions correlated positively with rectal temperature. Convective heat
   exchange was insignificant for thermoregulation by G. spixii.
   Evaporative heat loss increased when the thermal environment inhibited
   the radiative pathway. Females showed higher evaporative thermolysis
   than males at times of greater thermal challenge, suggesting a lower
   tolerance to heat stress. Therefore, infrared thermography identified
   the thermal windows, which represented the first line of defense against
   overheating in G. spixii. The periocular and preocular surface
   temperatures could be used as predictors of the thermal state of G.
   spixii.

AB Individual growth and size distributions within populations are
   generally influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Positively
   skewed size distributions may arise as a result of any size-selective
   process, such as food scarcity or competition. While such patterns have
   been observed for a variety of terrestrial plant and animal species,
   size distribution has been less studied for marine fish in the natural
   environment. This we do in the present paper. In order to investigate
   the effect of density and environment on juvenile coastal cod (Gadus
   morhua L.), we assess the length distributions of fish caught at fixed
   locations along the southern Norwegian Skagerrak coast over the period
   1919-1996. We demonstrate that most distributions are skewed to the
   right, suggesting that competition may influence these systems; such
   effects seem to be strongest for sheltered stations inside the fjords.
   Density dependence is inferred as skewness increases with increased
   density, and the. average length decreases with increased density. The
   skewness, average length, and abundance of juvenile cod caught in the

AB The number of days on which a measureable increment occurred, and the
   average rate of stem growth, rather than the overall duration of the wet
   season, were the main determinants of ring width in young Callitris
   intratropica trees. These effects were amplified by competition.
   Dendroclimatology of tropical tree species is an important tool for
   understanding past climatic variability at low latitudes where long-term
   weather records are often absent. Despite the growing number of
   published tropical tree-ring chronologies, however, still little is
   known of the factors that control annual ring formation in tropical tree
   species. In this paper we used an endemic Australian conifer, Callitris
   intratropica, to study the intra-annual dynamics of seasonal growth and
   xylem formation, and the effects of environmental conditions and
   competition, on growth ring formation. We combined high-resolution
   growth and climate monitoring (every 15 min for 2 years) with less
   frequent cambial sampling. Trees exhibited marked reductions in growth
   during certain periods within the rainy season when rainfall was not as
   regular and VPD was high. Overall, we found that ring width was most
   influenced by the number of days when increment occurred; regardless of
   how early the growing season began or ended, and by the rates of
   tracheid production. The effect of competition was also important. Trees
   growing in dense groves had narrower annual rings (4.6 mm) than trees
   that were growing in the open (6.7 mm), due to less active cambia,
   slower rates of xylem production and expansion and more increment days,
   although the overall growing season duration was also shorter in grove
   trees.

AB The temperature in human testis is 2-3 degrees C less than that of body
   providing a suitable environment for sperm production. Pampiniform
   plexus play a major role in this. Authors question the full function of
   Pampiniform plexus; if it is sufficiently efficient to maintain the
   optimal temperature, why testes are not retained in abdomen. The present
   hypothesis states that during the process of spermatogenesis a large
   amount of heat is liberated as a bye product of energy utilization.
   Testes are purposefully kept away in the dangling scrotum to exclude the
   damage otherwise it would have caused to visceral organs from the heat
   it produced. The heat from testes is carefully liberated by scrotum. The
   thin skin with no subcutaneous fat, scanty hair distribution and
   presence of more sweat glands on it permits easy escape of heat. On
   exposure to cold, the scrota( surface area is minimized by rugosities
   for heat conservation and cremaster muscles lift testes closer to
   abdomen to provide heat to body. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The physiology of vines (Vitis vinifera) is regulated by the mesoscale
   and large-scale climatic conditions. Valle de Guadalupe is a winegrowing
   basin where most of Mexico's wine production takes place and presents
   climatic variations in mesoscale that could influence the grape
   ripening. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   climatic differences on the ripening of the Nebbiolo grape variety, in
   two winegrowing areas of Valle de Guadalupe. Due to the distance from
   the coast, finding climatic differences in the valley and in the grape
   ripening in the study areas was to be expected. Over the course of four
   seasons, soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, and pH were
   evaluated in grapes from the central zone of Valle de Guadalupe and the
   area nearest to the sea, San Antonio de la Minas (SAM), Baja California,
   Mexico. In addition, temperature, relative humidity, irradiance,
   rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction were evaluated from 2012 to
   2015. The soluble solids concentration and pH were significantly higher
   in the Guadalupe grapes' must than in SAM grapes during the four
   seasons. On the contrary, the concentration of organic acids always was
   lower in the must of Guadalupe grapes than in the SAM's. The irradiance
   was similar in both areas, but the daily average temperature and the
   number of days with extreme temperatures were higher in Guadalupe. On
   the contrary, relative humidity and precipitation were higher in SAM.
   The early ripening of Guadalupe's Nebbiolo grapes seems to be the result
   of higher average temperatures, frequent warm periods, and lower
   relative humidity in Guadalupe compared with SAM.

AB Rheological properties of adherent cells are essential for their
   physiological functions, and microrheological measurements on living
   cells have shown that their viscoelastic responses follow a weak power
   law over a wide range of time scales. This power law is also influenced
   by mechanical prestress borne by the cytoskeleton, suggesting that
   cytoskeletal prestress determines the cell's viscoelasticity, but the
   biophysical origins of this behavior are largely unknown. We have
   recently developed a stochastic two-dimensional model of an elastically
   joined chain that links the power-law rheology to the prestress. Here we
   use a similar approach to study the creep response of a prestressed
   three-dimensional elastically jointed chain as a viscoelastic model of
   semiflexible polymers that comprise the prestressed cytoskeletal
   lattice. Using a Monte Carlo based algorithm, we show that numerical
   simulations of the chain's creep behavior closely correspond to the
   behavior observed experimentally in living cells. The power-law creep
   behavior results from a finite-speed propagation of free energy from the
   chain's end points toward the center of the chain in response to an
   externally applied stretching force. The property that links the power
   law to the prestress is the chain's stiffening with increasing
   prestress, which originates from entropic and enthalpic contributions.
   These results indicate that the essential features of cellular rheology
   can be explained by the viscoelastic behaviors of individual
   semiflexible polymers of the cytoskeleton.

AB Although aphids are the most species-rich group of invasive alien
   insects across the Southern Ocean Islands, their biology on the islands
   is poorly known. In this study, host plant-related, seasonal and
   altitudinal variation in the abundance of the three aphid species
   (Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Myzus ascalonicus, Rhopalosiphum padi) found on
   sub-Antarctic Marion Island is examined. Myzus ascalonicus is the most
   abundant of the species, reaching densities of c. 2,400 individuals per
   1,200 cm(2) on the indigenous Acaena magellanica (Rosaceae) and 479
   individuals per 1,200 cm(2) on the indigenous Cotula plumosa
   (Asteraceae), with lower numbers at elevations up to 300 m and a
   pronounced seasonal peak in December-February. Macrosiphum euphorbiae
   occurs on the same plant species in densities of between c. 11
   individuals per 1,200 cm(2) on C. plumosa and c. 200 individuals per
   1,200 cm(2) on A. magellanica, and with a pronounced summer peak in
   December. In both species, small numbers of winged forms are found (c.
   1-5%), although they are permanently parthenogenetic on the island.
   Rhopalosiphum padi is also permanently parthenogenetic on the island and
   likewise shows a December peak in abundance. The current data suggest
   that low ambient temperatures, which are close to the lower development
   threshold of R. padi, and other temperate aphid species, limit
   development in winter, thus leading to a decline in abundance.

AB The molecular motor gliding assay, in which a microtubule or other
   filament moves across a surface coated with motors, has provided much
   insight into how molecular motors work. The kinesin-microtubule system
   is also a strong candidate for the job of nanoparticle transporter in
   nanotechnology devices. In most cases, several motors transport each
   filament. Each motor serves both to bind the microtubule to a stationary
   surface and to propel the microtubule along the surface. By applying a
   uniform transverse force of 4-19 pN to a superparamagnetic bead attached
   to the trailing end of the microtubule, we have measured the distance d
   between binding points (motors). The average value of d was determined
   as a function of motor surface density sigma. The measurements agree
   well with the scaling model of Duke, Holy, and Liebler, which predicts
   that < d > similar to sigma(-2/5) if 0.05 <= sigma <= 20 mu m(-2) [Phys.
   Rev. Lett. 74, 330 (1995)]. The distribution of d fits an extension of
   the model. The radius of curvature of a microtubule bent at a binding
   point by the force of the magnetic bead was approximate to 1 mu m,
   5000-fold smaller than the radius of curvature of microtubules subjected
   only to thermal forces. This is evidence that at these points of high
   bending stress, generated by the force on the magnetic bead, the
   microtubule is in the more flexible state of a two-state model of
   microtubule bending proposed by Heussinger, Schuller, and Frey [Phys.
   Rev. E 81, 021904 (2010)].

AB We use optical trapping to continuously bend an isolated microtubule
   while simultaneously measuring the applied force and the resulting
   filament strain, thus allowing us to determine its elastic properties
   over a wide range of applied strains. We find that, while in the
   low-strain regime, microtubules may be quantitatively described in terms
   of the classical Euler-Bernoulli elastic filament, above a critical
   strain they deviate from this simple elastic model, showing a softening
   response with increasingdeformations. A three-dimensional thin-shell
   model, in which the increased mechanical compliance is caused by
   flattening and eventual buckling of the filament cross-section, captures
   this softening effect in the high strain regime and yields quantitative
   values of the effective mechanical properties of microtubules. Our
   results demonstrate that properties of microtubules are highly dependent
   on the magnitude of the applied strain and offer a new interpretation
   for the large variety in microtubule mechanical data measured by
   different methods.

AB Thermal evolution of the Ziar Mts was studied using zircon and apatite
   fission track (ZFT and AFT) thermochronology applied to basement and
   sedimentary rocks. Basement samples from the Tatric Unit of the Inner
   Western Carpathians (IWC) yielded cooling ZFT ages in the range from 109
   +/- 5.9 to 92.1 +/- 5.3 Ma and apparent AFT ages between 33.7 +/- 2.7
   and 24.4 +/- 1.7 Ma. Paleogene sediments of the Central Carpathian
   Paleogene Basin (CCPB) yielded apparent AFT ages of 73.2 +/- 2.7 and
   49.6 +/- 1.8 Ma. ZFT data show that during early Late Cretaceous
   thrusting the crystalline basement was buried by a nappe pile to crustal
   depths with temperatures between 2 10 and 3 10 degrees C, where the
   crystalline core was metamorphosed at anchizonal conditions. AFT data
   revealed a complex thermal evolution, implying that after nappe stacking
   and metamorphism the basement was exhumed to the surface and that it was
   buried beneath a thick pile of sediments of the CCPB. The CCPB was
   inverted and the basement finally exhumed in the Late Oligocene to,
   Early Miocene. The AFT system in the basement and CCPB samples record
   also a distinct, Middle Miocene thermal event, related to the increased
   heat flow induced by upwelling of hot mantle material and related
   volcanic activity. Our data support the hypothesis that the study area
   was part of a large CCPB basin and contradict the widely accepted
   assumption that the Variscan crystalline core of the Ziar Mts lacks an
   Alpine metamorphic overprint.

   A total of 37 species and two subspecies from 17 genera representing

   analysis includes species that are restricted to the Mediterranean
   ecosystem as well as those which also inhabit additional environments.
   The data suggest that cicadas adapt to the climate type regardless of
   particular types of plants within the various Mediterranean communities.
   Similarly, cicada thermal responses are independent of body size or
   taxonomic affinities. There is a wider range of body temperatures for
   the maximum voluntary tolerance temperature than for heat torpor or
   minimum flight temperatures. This diversity seems to be determined by
   the subdivision of the habitat used and the behavior of the species. All
   species possess relatively elevated heat torpor temperatures adapting to
   the general thermal characteristics of the Mediterranean ecosystem. The

   Little is known about the mechanisms of the photosynthetic response to

   exchange, metabolite levels, and chlorophyll fluorescence during the
   photosynthetic induction response in an Oryza sativa indica cultivar
   with high yield (Takanari) and a japonica cultivar with lower yield
   (Koshihikari). Takanari had a faster induction response to sudden
   increases in light intensity than Koshihikari, as demonstrated by faster
   increases in net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and
   electron transport rate. In a simulated light regime that mimicked a
   typical summer day, the faster induction response in Takanari increased
   daily CO2 assimilation by 10%. The faster response of Takanari was
   explained in part by its maintenance of a larger pool of Calvin-Benson
   cycle metabolites. Together, the rapid responses of electron transport
   rate, metabolic flux, and stomatal conductance in Takanari contributed
   to the greater daily carbon gain under fluctuating light typical of
   natural environments.

AB Soils of continental Antarctic nunataks represent unusual ecosystems

   assessed for the vast majority of Antarctic nunataks. This study
   focussed on the previously uncharacterised inland nunataks of the
   Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen ranges in Dronning Maud Land. As with many
   oligotrophic soils in Antarctica, bacteria from the phyla Acidobacteria,
   Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were prevalent. High relative
   abundances of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were also observed in these
   soils. Potential phototrophic capabilities of these bacterial
   populations were indicated by the presence of genes involved in the
   Calvin-Benson reductive pentose phosphate cycle as well as that of
   aerobic phototrophic bacteriochlorophyll. Clear spatial patterns of
   bacterial biodiversity between nunataks in this study were observed,
   particularly between the Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen nunataks which
   are geographically separated by the Jutulstraumen glacier. Not
   unexpectedly, the bacterial community profiles found in these nunataks
   were distinct from those found in alternate biogeographic regions (e.g.
   Dry Valleys, Peninsula and Larsemann Hills). Despite belonging to the
   same bioregion (i.e. Dronning Maud Land), however, the clear
   differentiation of bacterial communities between the
   Jutulsessen/Ahlmannryggen and that of Sor Rondane suggests that, based
   on bacterial phylogeography, the Dronning Maud Land bioregion can be
   divided into sub-bioregions.

   ecologically over the last two decades or so, and developing sustainable
   management strategies for the lagoon required a concerted study
   involving physical, chemical, and biological investigations at the
   ecosystem level or ecological modeling. In the present research held for
   period 5-6 years (2004-10), a Lagrangian approach was made to addressing
   some major issues concerning the lagoon such as factors that sustained
   the ecosystem so far and its further evolution. Such interdisciplinary
   approaches should help answer several ecological questions say, "when
   does large-scale hypoxia occur?" in such water bodies and what are the
   measures needed to avoid hypoxic events, etc. In the present study, we
   have made an attempt to understand the changes associated with
   biogeochemical cycles in the lagoon especially the dissolved oxygen and
   net ecosystem metabolism events. The study presented here unifies the
   physical/chemical/ biological processes obtainable through monitoring
   the Chilka Lake via sound field observations with a modeling approach
   which is the essence of this study.

AB Analysis of in situ temperature records collected on six coral reefs in
   the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Florida Keys reveal significant variability
   across a range of temporal and spatial scales from minutes to seasons,
   across depths, and among sites. Subsurface variability occurring at
   daily and faster frequencies is prevalent across the region, likely
   driven by combinations of diurnal heating and cooling, wind driven
   advection, and internal waves at tidal and faster frequencies. This high
   frequency variability is not detected in records of remotely-sensed sea
   surface temperature alone. Diurnal variability likely caused by diurnal
   solar heating and cooling and possibly by advection associated with
   diurnal winds (daily sea breeze) was significant at all sites and showed
   greatest magnitude of variation at shallowest depths. Temperature
   fluctuations at tidal and faster frequencies were common at 5 out of the
   6 sites. The magnitude of this variability is not well explained by
   measured vertical temperature stratification combined with oscillations
   of the water column associated with barotropic surface tides. Rather,
   the magnitude and nature of the temperature changes point to the
   presence of internal waves generated at tidal and faster frequencies.
   Power spectra calculated seasonally show greatest variability within
   both diurnal and semi-diurnal frequency bands in Spring and Summer at
   Florida, Bahamas, Jamaica, and St. Croix. Variability within the
   semi-diurnal frequency band at Belize and Bonaire was greatest in
   Winter. Warming in Summer estimated as degree-hours per day above 29.0
   degrees C increased with increasing latitude and varied significantly
   among sites and depths in a manner not predictable from remotely sensed
   SST data alone. Site latitude was directly related to the amplitude of
   the seasonal thermal variability, but was not tightly related to
   variability at daily and faster frequencies which was greatest at the
   highest and lowest latitude sites. The interactions of depth, site, and
   season across the study region are associated with distinct signals of
   thermal variability, and have significant implications for the
   physiology and ecology of corals and other reef organisms.

AB The fine-scale effects of fire and the consequences for seed survival
   are poorly understood, especially in the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas).
   Thus, we investigated whether vegetation gaps (bare soil patches)
   influence the survival of exposed seeds during fire events in the
   Cerrado by serving as safe sites. We performed field fire experiments in
   Central Brazil to examine how gap size (% of bare soil) influences fire
   heat (fire temperatures and residence time) and seed survival
   (Experiment 1) and to determine how seed survival is affected by fixed
   conditions: gaps vs grass tussocks during fires (Experiment 2). We used
   seeds of two common Cerrado legumes, Mimosa leiocephala Benth. and
   Harpalyce brasiliana Benth. Seed survival was analysed using GLMMs with
   a binomial distribution. In Experiment 1, seeds survived (38 and 35% for
   M. leiocephala and H. brasiliana respectively) only when the gaps had
   >40% of bare soil. In Experiment 2, all seeds under grass tussocks died
   when exposed to fire, whereas up to 40% of seeds survived in vegetation
   gaps, relative to their respective controls. Because vegetation gaps
   influence fire heat, they are important as safe sites for seed survival
   in the Cerrado, allowing a significant proportion of seeds to survive
   when exposed at the soil surface.

AB Aim To identify the dominant spatial patterns of Fagus sylvatica radial
   growth in the Eastern Alps, and to understand their relationships to
   climate variation and bioclimatic gradients.
   Location Fourteen beech stands in the Eastern Alps, growing between 200
   and 1500 m a.s.l. in Italy, Slovenia and Austria.
   Methods At each site, trees were sampled using increment borers or by
   taking discs from felled trees. Cores and discs were processed by
   measuring and crossdating ring width. Ring width series were
   standardized, averaged, and prewhitened to obtain site chronologies.
   Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Components Analysis of
   prewhitened site chronologies were used to identify spatial and
   altitudinal growth patterns, related to the bioclimatic position of each
   stand. Bootstrap correlation and response functions were computed
   between monthly climatic variables and either principal component scores
   or composite chronologies from stands associated by HCA. The stability
   of dendroclimatic signals was analyzed by moving correlation functions
   (MCF). Correlation analysis (teleconnections) based on a data base of 37
   Italian and Slovenian beech tree-ring chronologies revealed the spatial
   extent of principal component scores.
   Results Sampled trees were 200-400 years old, representing the oldest
   beech trees that have been crossdated for the Alps to date. Maximum age
   was directly related to altitude and to the presence of historical forms
   of conservation. Tree-ring parameters varied according to geographic
   patterns and the age of sampled trees. Stands were bioclimatically
   organized according to their location, and with reference to their
   elevation and distance from the Adriatic Sea. A direct response to
   winter temperature was found at all elevations. The altitudinal gradient
   ranged from low-elevation stands, characterized by a Mediterranean-type,
   late spring-summer drought signal, to mountain and high-elevation
   stands, characterized by a direct response to growing season temperature
   plus an inverse response to the previous year's July temperature. The
   mountain and high-elevation signal was evident in Austria, the Central
   Alps and Slovenia, while the low-elevation signal was confined to
   mountains adjacent to the Adriatic Sea. MCF revealed trends in the
   response to climatic factors affecting tree-ring formation in mountain
   and high-mountain stands linked to climatic warming.
   Main conclusions Dendroclimatic networks can be used for bioclimatic
   studies of tree populations. A biogeographical separation emerged
   between the Alps and the Apennines at the upper elevations, while
   different degrees of mediterraneity distinguished sites at lower
   elevations. This information will be useful in assessing any future
   climate-related bioclimatic shifts, especially for forests at ecotones
   and along altitudinal gradients.

AB Studies of anuran population dynamics are key to uncovering the
   mechanisms responsible for temporal fluctuations in abundance and those
   that shape population structure. Population structure and population
   fluctuations can result from species specific demographic and behavioral
   characteristics, reproductive microhabitat availability (which is
   influenced by local environment and climate), as well as from responses
   to populations of other, sympatric species. In view of this, our study
   aimed to ascertain the temporal trends in a population of Hypsiboas
   leptolineatus, to describe how abundance changes between seasons, and to
   uncover the effects of environmental variables in shaping seasonal
   variations in abundance. Although H. leptolineatus occurs throughout the
   year, abundance showed a clear seasonal pattern linked to an interaction
   between temperature, relative air humidy, and moon phase.

AB The environmental conditions in regions with Mediterranean climate are
   favorable for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth until the anthesis but
   afterwards exposed to terminal heat stress. Relative contribution of
   stem reserves during grain filling is assumed to increase compared with
   current photosynthesis. This study evaluated the ability of different
   wheat genotypes for accumulation and remobilization of stem water
   soluble carbohydrate (WSC) under the heat stress conditions during the
   grain filling. Ten spring bread wheat genotypes were grown under
   controlled conditions of phytotron with two temperature treatments i.e.
   normal and heat stress. There was significant variation among the
   genotypes for WSC concentration and remobilization. WSC remobilization
   increased under heat stress (on average 60%). Strong association between
   maximum WSC concentration in main stem and WSC remobilization was found.
   Under heat stress, the number of grains per spike correlated with WSC
   remobilization (r= 0.45) and correlation of percentage reduction of
   grain yield with WSC remobilization efficiency was negative (r = -0.47).
   However, there was no significant relation between grain yield and stem
   reserves remobilization under heat stress during grain filling. It seems
   that the tolerance to the heat stress would be provided either through
   maintenance of current photosynthesis or by high remobilization of stem
   reserves. (C) 2014 Friends Science Publishers

AB Due to the higher energy requirements of birds during winter, it is
   predicted that the activities of metabolic enzymes (e.g., citrate
   synthase, CS and cytochrome C oxidase, COX) should increase in tandem
   with increases in rates of energy expenditure (e.g., basal metabolic
   rate, BMR). However, there is mixed support for the hypothesis of
   enzymatic acclimatization. Furthermore, there is little information
   about the effect of ambient temperature on energetics and tissue enzyme
   activity levels in passerines inhabiting seasonal Mediterranean
   environments. In this study we evaluated the interplay between BMR and
   enzyme activities of freshly caught individuals of the passerine
   Zonotrichia capensis in winter and summer in a Mediterranean environment
   from central Chile, and also in warm (30 degrees C) and cold (15 degrees
   C) lab-acclimated birds. The results revealed a lack of seasonal
   variation in BMR, thermal conductance and in the activity of CS and COX.
   However, we found higher BMR and lower thermal conductance in
   cold-acclimated than in warm-acclimated birds. Also, total CS activity
   was higher in the flight muscles of cold-acclimated than in
   warm-acclimated birds. We found also a significant correlation between
   BMR and total CS activity in pectoral muscle. Although some authors have
   suggested that BMR mainly depends on the metabolic intensity and mass of
   internal organs, our results revealed that skeletal muscles such as the
   flight muscles may also affect BMR. Finally, differences in the
   acclimation and acclimatization responses in Rufous-collared sparrows
   suggest that large-scale oscillations in the physical environment might
   maintain the capacity for flexibility in thermogenic traits through
   generations.

AB Hormesis in longevity is a widespread phenomenon across the animal
   kingdom. It takes place when longevity is improved as an indirect effect
   of mild stress. We explored some possible evolutionary trajectories of
   hormesis in longevity in artificially selected lines of Drosophila
   buzzatii, The lines were bi-directionally selected for either knockdown
   resistance to heat stress (K, K+) or chill-coma recovery (CCR, CCR+,
   with the + and - signs indicating selection for decreased and increased
   tolerance, respectively). All K and CCR lines successfully diverged due
   to thermal-stress selection. The heat-inducible hormesis in longevity
   was substantial in both K and CCR females, whereas no hormesis was
   apparent for females in CCR+, K+ and control lines. Among-line
   differences in longevity of non-heat-treated females disappeared after a
   heat-hardening treatment. Hormesis effects on the demographic senescence
   rate were sex-specific and consistently higher in the shorter-lived than
   in the longer-lived lines. Hormesis is an adaptive response, as its
   magnitude can evolutionary increase with stress-sensitivity. (C) 2008

AB Human-induced thermal variability can disrupt energy balance and
   performance in ectotherms; however, phenotypic plasticity may play a
   pivotal protective role. Ectotherm performance can be maintained in
   thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of
   physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the
   capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond
   to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed
   to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable:
   13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1))
   thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5
   degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass
   gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the
   thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed,
   U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth
   was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures
   compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant
   variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments,
   suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature
   rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a
   plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive
   to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal
   breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod
   treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures
   (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52
   +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL
   s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.). In combination, these findings
   suggest juvenile A. medirostris are resilient to daily fluctuations in
   temperature, within the temperature range tested here.

AB Within the context of species distribution models, scrutiny arises from
   the choice of meaningful environmental predictors. Thermal conditions
   are not the sole driver, but are the most widely acknowledged abiotic
   driver of plant life within alpine ecosystems. We linked long-term
   measurements of direct, plant-relevant, near-surface temperatures to
   plant species frequency. Across 47 sites located along environmental
   gradients within the Scandinavian mountain chain, the thermal
   preferences of 26 focal species of vascular plants, lichens, and
   bryophytes were explored. Based on partial least-squares regression, we
   applied a relative importance analysis to derive inductively the thermal
   variables that were best related to a species' frequency. To discover
   potential seasonal variability of thermal controls, analyses were both
   differentiated according to meteorological season and integrated across
   the entire year. The pronounced interspecies and temporal variability of
   thermal constraints revealed the thermal niches were much more nuanced
   and variable than they have commonly been represented. This finding
   challenges us to present, interrogate, and interpret data representing
   these thermal niches, which seems to be required in order to move beyond
   purely probabilistic and correlative descriptions of species' range
   limits. Thus, this information will help improve predictions of species
   distributions in complex arctic-alpine landscapes.

AB For speciose, but poorly known groups, such as terrestrial arthropods,
   functional traits present a potential avenue to assist in predicting
   responses to environmental change. Species turnover is common along
   environmental gradients, but it is unclear how this is reflected in
   species traits. Community-level change in arthropod traits, other than
   body size, has rarely been explored across spatial scales comparable to
   those examined here. We hypothesized that the composition and
   morphological traits of spider assemblages would differ across a
   gradient of climate and habitat structure. We examined foliage-living
   spider assemblages associated with Themeda triandra grasslands along a
   900km climatic gradient in south-eastern Australia. We used
   sweep-netting to collect T.triandra-associated spiders and counted
   juveniles and identified adults. We also measured morphological traits
   of adult spiders and noted their hunting mode. Associations with
   measures of habitat structure were less consistent than relationships
   with climate. Both juvenile and adult spiders were more abundant in
   warmer sites, although species richness was not affected by temperature.
   We found distinct turnover in species composition along the climatic
   gradient, with hunting spiders, particularly crab spiders (Thomisidae),
   making up a greater proportion of assemblages in warmer climates. A
   range of traits of spiders correlated with the climatic gradient. For
   example, larger spider species and species that were active hunters were
   more common in warmer climates. Changes in morphological traits across
   species, rather than within species drove the morphology-climate
   relationship. Strong climate-trait correlations suggest that it may be
   possible to predict changes in functional traits of assemblages in
   response to anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change.

AB Access to electricity, granting relative independence of human activity

   for the absence of seasonal changes in the daily rhythms of humans
   living in urban areas. Featuring a population of adult Guarani natives
   living without access to electricity, the present naturalistic study was
   designed to explore possible effects of different natural photoperiods
   and temperature on human circadian rhythms. We compared time series of
   wrist temperature (WT) and motor activity in winter and summer,
   respectively, 01 24 individuals aged 18 to 80. Twenty-four-hour rhythms
   of WT showed lower amplitudes and higher mean levels in summer, with no
   significant seasonal differences in acrophase. In contrast,
   rest-activity (RA) rhythms exhibited a significantly later rest on-and
   offset in summer, but no seasonal changes in duration, amplitude and
   mean level. We furthermore identified a phase advance of both the WT
   acrophase and rest onset with increasing age of the individuals. We
   concluded that in our study the effect of different seasons was
   reflected in the amplitude and mean level of the WT rhythm, as well the
   onset of nighttime rest, which was delayed in summer. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB The properties of a negative transient signal (negative peak) observed
   during the first seconds of the induction of the photoacoustic (PA)
   signal in dark-adapted barley leaves treated with methyl viologen (MV)
   and diuron and then exposed to high temperatures have been examined.
   Under those conditions no electron donation from photosystem II (PSII)
   occurred, and electron How through PSI could be supported only by
   soluble reductants located in the chloroplast stroma. The negative peak
   was observed only if the PA signal had been monitored at low, and not
   high, frequencies. The peak obviously originated from the oxygen
   consumption by PSI. The size of the peak increased as the temperature of
   preheating was raised from 39 to 45 degreesC. The size of the peak
   decreased exponentially with a half-time of 3.7 s during illumination
   under low light. This decrease was found to be much faster under strong
   light. The recovery of the peak during dark acclimation required several
   minutes. It is concluded that the negative peak reflects the oxygen
   consumption supported by stromal reductants, their pool being rapidly
   exhausted under light in the presence of MV. The maximal size of the
   pool was calculated as 140 eq: P700 in dark-adapted leaves.

AB Snowand ice in the Central Andes of Chile and Argentina (33-36 degrees
   S) are the major source of water for the highly populated regions near
   the cities of Santiago and Mendoza. However, our knowledge of the forces
   driving the general glacier retreat in the region is limited. In order
   to obtain a long-term perspective of glacier fluctuations and their
   relationships with climate in the Central Andes, historical glacier
   variations were documented and compared with a tree-ring precipitation
   reconstruction based upon Austrocedrus chilensis trees. A multi-proxy
   approach (historical documents, old aerial photographs and satellite
   imagery) was used to map the fluctuations of eight glaciers, including
   the Cipreses Glacier, which provides the oldest record of glacier
   variations in the region starting in AD 1842. All the studied glaciers
   exhibited a negative trend during the 20th century with mean frontal
   retreats between - 50 and - 9 m y(-1), thinning rates between 0.76 and
   0.56 m y(-1) and a mean ice area reduction of 3% since 1955. More than
   350 tree-ring cores were combined into three tree-ring chronologies,
   which strongly correlate with the instrumental precipitation in Santiago
   de Chile (33 degrees 26', S; 70 degrees 41' W. 520 m asl). Based on
   these records, a 712-year precipitation reconstruction was developed.
   This reconstruction is characterised by a centennial oscillation
   indicating marked dry conditions around the years 1440 and 1600 AD. Wet
   conditions were prevalent in the years 1500,1650 and particularly around
   1850 AD. Since this precipitation maximum, the reconstruction shows a
   clear, secular, decreasing trend. The reduction in precipitation
   indicated by this reconstruction for the last 150 yr, in combination
   with a significant warming recorded in Central Chile, are the main
   causes of the observed current glacier retreats. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Complex life cycles characterized by uncertainty at transitions between
   larval/juvenile and adult environments could favour irreversible
   physiological plasticity at such transitions. To assess whether thermal
   tolerance of intertidal mussels (Mytilus californianus) adjusts to
   post-settlement environmental conditions, we collected juveniles from
   their thermally buffered microhabitat from high-and low-shore locations
   at cool (wave-exposed) and warm (wave-protected) sites. Juveniles were
   transplanted to unsheltered cages at the two low sites or placed in a
   common garden. Juveniles transplanted to thewarm site for one month in
   summer had higher thermal tolerance, regardless of origin site. By
   contrast, common-garden juveniles from all sites had lower tolerance
   indistinguishable from exposed site transplants. After six months in the
   field plus a common garden period, there was a trend for higher thermal
   tolerance at the protected site, while reduced thermal tolerance at both
   sites indicated seasonal acclimatization. Thermal tolerance and growth
   rate were inversely related after one but not six months; protected-site
   transplants were more tolerant but grew more slowly. In contrast to
   juveniles, adults fromlow-shore exposed and protected sites retained
   differences in thermal tolerance after common garden treatment in
   summer. Both irreversible and reversible forms of plasticity must be
   considered in organismal responses to changing environments.

AB Apparent controversies exist on whether the persistence length of
   microtubules depends on its contour length. This issue is particularly
   challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the tubular
   structure and strongly anisotropic material property of microtubules.
   Here we adopt a higher order continuum orthotropic thin shell model to
   study the flexural behavior of microtubules. Our model overcomes some
   key limitations of a recent study based on a simplified anisotropic
   shell model and results in a closed-form solution for the
   contour-length-dependent persistence length of microtubules, with
   predictions in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. By
   studying the ratio between their contour and persistence lengths, we
   find that microtubules with length at similar to 1.5 mu m show the
   lowest flexural rigidity, whereas those with length at similar to 15 mu
   m show the highest flexural rigidity. This finding may provide an
   important theoretical basis for understanding the mechanical structure
   of mitotic spindles during cell division. Further analysis on the
   buckling of microtubules indicates that the critical buckling load
   becomes insensitive to the tube length for relatively short
   microtubules, in drastic contrast to the classical Euler buckling. These
   rich flexural behaviors of microtubules are of profound implication for
   many biological functions and biomimetic molecular devices.

AB Coping with temporal variation in fire requires plants to have
   plasticity in traits that promote persistence, but how plastic responses
   to current conditions are affected by past fire exposure remains
   unknown. We investigate phenotypic divergence between populations of
   four resprouting grasses exposed to differing experimental fire regimes
   (annually burnt or unburnt for greater than 35 years) and test whether
   divergence persists after plants are grown in a common environment for 1
   year. Traits relating to flowering and biomass allocation were measured
   before plants were experimentally burnt, and their regrowth was tracked.
   Genetic differentiation between populations was investigated for a
   subset of individuals. Historic fire frequency influenced traits
   relating to flowering and below-ground investment. Previously burnt
   plants produced more inflorescences and invested proportionally more
   biomass below ground, suggesting a greater capacity for recruitment and
   resprouting than unburnt individuals. Tiller-scale regrowth rate did not
   differ between treatments, but prior fire exposure enhanced total
   regrown biomass in two species. We found no consistent genetic
   differences between populations suggesting trait differences arose from
   developmental plasticity. Grass development is influenced by prior fire
   exposure, independent of current environmental conditions. This priming
   response to fire, resulting in adaptive trait changes, may produce
   communities more resistant to future fire regime changes.

AB Sound knowledge of present-day diatom species and their environments is
   crucial when attempting to reconstruct past climate and environmental
   changes based on fossil assemblages. For the North Atlantic region, the
   biogeography and ecology of many diatom taxa that are used as
   indicator-species in paleoceanographic studies are still not well known.
   Using information contained in large diatom-environment calibration
   datasets can greatly increase our knowledge on diatom taxa and improve
   the accuracy of paleoenvironmental reconstructions. A diatom calibration
   dataset including 183 surface sediment samples from the northern North
   Atlantic was used to explore the distribution and ecology of 21 common
   Northern Hemisphere diatom taxa. We define the ecological responses of
   these species to April sea ice concentrations and August sea surface
   temperatures (aSSTs) using Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF)-response curves,
   provide distribution maps, temperature optima and ranges, and
   high-quality light microscope images. Based on the results, we find
   species clearly associated with cold, warm and temperate waters. All
   species have a statistically significant relationship with aSST, and 15
   species with sea ice. Of these, Actinocyclus curvatulus, Fragilariopsis
   oceanica and Porosira glacialis are most abundant at high sea ice
   concentrations, whereas Coscinodiscus radiants, Shionodiscus oestrupii,
   Thalassionema nitzschioides, Thalassiosira angulata, Thalassiosira
   nordenskioeldii and Thalassiosira pacifica are associated with low sea
   ice concentrations/ice-free conditions. Interestingly, some species
   frequently used as sea ice indicators, such as Fragilariopsis cylindrus,
   show similar abundances at high and low sea ice concentrations with no
   statistically significant relationship to sea ice.

AB There is a paucity of data regarding the multiple timescale variations
   of heterotrophic respiration (R (H)) and autotrophic respiration (R (A))
   as well as the primary controlling factors. The objective of this study
   is to find the temporal variations of total soil respiration (R (S)) and
   its components, revealing the driving factors at different timescales.
   A trenching method was used to distinguish R (S), R (H), and R (A) in a
   spruce-fir valley forest in northeastern China. We used the closed
   dynamic chamber method to measure the soil respiration rate. Analyses of
   R (S), R (H), and R (A) in relation to biotic and abiotic factors were
   conducted to realize the temporal variations at different timescales.
   Only R (S) and R (H) showed a distinct diurnal variation and soil
   temperature (T (S)) can explain 68 and 59 % of the daily variation,
   respectively. R (S), R (H), and R (A) showed a pronounced, single peak
   curve seasonally, and T (S) can explain 11-95 % of the seasonal
   variation. Soil moisture (W (S)) maintained at a relatively high level
   and was not related to R (S), R (H), or R (A) on a seasonal scale, and
   there was no significant relationship between the seasonal R (S), R (A),
   and root biomass. However, for 5 years, only the mean R (A) of the
   growing season was significantly related to the mean W (S), which can
   explain 39 % of the inter-annual variation of R (A). The annual
   variations of litterfall and the relative growth rate of stems were not
   related to R (S), R (H), or R (A). The contribution of R (H) to R (S)
   was larger, and the temperature sensitivity was 2.01-3.71 for R (S),
   1.90-3.08 for R (H), and 2.20-5.65 for R (A).
   R (S), R (H), and R (A) show different temporal variations at multiple
   timescales. When W (S) is not restricted, T (S) is the primary driving
   factor of daily and seasonal variation of R (S) and R (H). In this site,
   R (H) accounts for a large proportion of R (S) and plays a crucial role
   in determining the magnitude and temporal variation of R (S).

AB The harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, is one of the most successful
   invasive insect species worldwide. We investigated whether (i) chill
   coma recovery time (CCRt) changes during the ontogenetic development of
   this species, (ii) CCRt varies in response to repeated cold shocks, and
   (iii) CCRt could be a good predictor of winter survival ability in
   adults. CCRt decreased during larval development, the lowest CCRt values
   were observed in teneral adults (one and four days old), and
   significantly higher values were observed for older adults (16 and 32
   days old). Repeated cold shocks (two hours at -3 degrees C), interrupted
   by short (30 min) warm periods (22 degrees C) resulted in decreased CCRt
   after the second cold shock, probably depicting an acclimation response,
   but then CCRt increased with additional cold shocks, likely revealing
   the accumulation of chill injuries. The CCRt of pre-overwintering
   individuals was not correlated with their winter survival. This
   indicates that CCRt is not a reliable measure of cold tolerance in H.
   axyridis. However, this result could be partially affected by the
   experimental setup the use of laboratory-reared individuals who
   experienced standardized conditions and thus the variability in CCRt of
   tested animals could be much lower than the variability present in
   nature. The substantial variation observed over the ontogenetic
   development of H. axyridis poses important methodological implications
   for future studies, as animals of the same stage/age should be compared
   with each other. The observed U-shaped response to repeated cold shocks
   indicates that the expectation of linearity between cold exposure and
   insect response is an oversimplification of real situations.

AB The inter-annual variability (IAV) of the terrestrial carbon cycle is
   tightly linked to the variability of semi-arid ecosystems. Thus, it is
   of utmost importance to understand what the main meteorological drivers
   for the IAV of such ecosystems are, and how they respond to extreme
   events such as droughts and heatwaves. To shed light onto these
   questions, we analyse the IAV of carbon fluxes, its relation with
   meteorological variables, and the impact of compound drought and
   heatwave on the carbon cycle of two similar ecosystems, along a
   precipitation gradient. A four-year long dataset from 2016 to 2019 was
   used for the FLUXNET sites ES-LMa and ES-Abr, located in central (39
   degrees 56'25 '' N 5 degrees 46'28 '' W) and southeastern (38 degrees
   42'6 '' N 6 degrees 47'9 '' W) Spain. We analyse the physiological
   impact of compound drought and heatwave on the dominant tree
   species,Quercus ilex.Our results show that the gross primary
   productivity of the wetter ecosystem was less sensitive to changes in
   soil water content, compared to the dryer site. Still, the wetter
   ecosystem was a source of CO(2)each year, owing to large ecosystem
   respiration during summer; while the dry site turned into a CO(2)sink
   during wet years. Overall, the impact of the summertime compound event
   on annual CO(2)fluxes was marginal at both sites, compared to drought
   events during spring or autumn. This highlights that drought timing is
   crucial to determine the annual carbon fluxes in these semi-arid
   ecosystems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018
   severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

AB The effect of chronic lithium treatment on morphine-induced analgesia
   was studied in a time-dependent manner in old mice. All mice received
   lithium chloride via drinking water of 600mg/l for three weeks. Both
   basal pain sensitivity and morphine-induced analgesia were determined
   with a hot-plate test before and after chronic lithium drinking at six
   different times of the day every four hours. Chronic lithium exposure
   did not cause any significant change in basal pain sensitivity but the
   circadian rhythm of morphine analgesia disappeared in old mice. These
   findings suggest that biological rhythms may alter pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic properties of drugs and conversely drugs may alter the
   rhythmic properties of biological functions. Thus, administration time
   of drugs should be considered in both experimental designs and clinical
   settings.

AB The fluctuating abundance of round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) in
   Mauritanian waters over the past ca. 20 years can be related to
   environmental dynamics off Northwest Africa. Trends in the fishery are
   evaluated using FAO data, acoustic surveys, and catch statistics from
   the EU fleet (1996-2006). Remote sensing data demonstrate rising annual
   sea surface temperatures, up to 3 degrees C higher than the long-term
   average in 2002-2003, following a shift in ocean climate in 1995. Fish
   abundance and repeated expansion of the sardinella population in the
   past 10 years are attributed to favorable oceanographic conditions and
   increased recruitment success. Sardinella thrives with intense upwelling
   and high primary production during spring, and retention of waters over
   the shelf during summer and autumn. The stock of S. aurita over the
   Northwest African shelf oscillates with the cold-warm states of the
   habitat. Favorable hydrographic conditions and extended habitat has
   resulted in unprecedented rise of sardinella abundance in the late
   1990s, which was counterbalanced by the impact of fisheries. A backshift
   to a cold-state ecosystem, with extensive regional upwelling and
   decreased sardinella habitat, would topple that balance. (c) 2007

AB The diversity and community structures of symbiotic dinoflagellates are
   described from reef invertebrates in southern and central provinces of
   the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and Zamami Island, Okinawa,
   Japan. The symbiont assemblages from region to region were dominated by
   Clade C Symbiodinium spp. and consisted of numerous host-specific and/or
   rare types (specialists), and several types common to many hosts
   (generalists). Prevalence in the host community among certain
   host-generalist symbionts differed between inshore and offshore
   environments, across latitudinal (central versus southern GBR)
   gradients, and over wide geographic ranges (GBR versus Okinawa). One
   particular symbiont (C3h) from the GBR had a dramatic shift in
   dominance. Its prevalence ranged from being extremely rare, or absent on
   high-latitude reefs to dominating the scleractinian diversity on a
   mid-latitude inshore reef. These changes occurred among coral fauna
   whose larvae must acquire symbionts from environmental sources
   (horizontal symbiont acquisition). Such differences did not occur among
   'vertical transmitters' such as Porites spp., Montipora spp. and
   pocilloporids (corals that directly transmit symbionts to their
   offspring) or among those hosts displaying 'horizontal acquisition', but
   that associate with specific symbionts. Most host-specialized types were
   found to be characteristic of a particular geographic region (i.e.
   Okinawa versus Central GBR versus Southern GBR). The mode of symbiont
   acquisition may play an important role in how symbiont composition may
   shift in west Pacific host communities in response to climate change.
   There is no indication that recent episodes of mass bleaching have
   provoked changes in host-symbiont combinations from the central GBR.

AB Coral reefs are increasingly affected by high-temperature stress events
   and associated bleaching. Monitoring and predicting these events have
   largely utilized sea surface temperature data, due to the convenience of
   using large-scale remotely sensed satellite measurements. However, coral
   bleaching has been observed to vary in severity throughout the water
   column, and variations in coral thermal stress across depths have not
   yet been well investigated. In this study, in situ water temperature
   data from 1999 to 2011 from three depths were used to calculate thermal
   stress on a coral reef in Bahia Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama, which
   was compared to satellite surface temperature data and thermal stress
   calculations for the same area and time period from the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch Satellite Bleaching
   Alert system. The results show similar total cumulative annual thermal
   stress for both the surface and depth-stratified data, but with a
   striking difference in the distribution of that stress among the depth
   strata during different high-temperature events, with the greatest
   thermal stress unusually recorded at the deepest measured depth during
   the most severe bleaching event in 2005. Temperature records indicate
   that a strong density-driven temperature inversion may have formed in
   this location in that year, contributing to the persistence and
   intensity of bleaching disturbance at depth. These results indicate that
   depth may not provide a stress refuge from high water temperature events
   in some situations, and in this case, the water properties at depth
   appear to have contributed to greater coral bleaching at depth compared
   to near-surface locations. This case study demonstrates the importance
   of incorporating depth-stratified temperature monitoring and small-scale
   oceanographic and hydrologic data for understanding and predicting local
   reef responses to elevated water temperature events.

   for the trapnet fisheries of the northeastern Newfoundland "northern"
   (NAFO 2J3KL) and northern "Gulf" of St. Lawrence (NAFO 3Pn4RS) Atlantic

   a 3-yr weighted and lagged moving average of catch.  For the years
   1972-81 (the first half of the available data) the trap index (T(i)) was
   regressed on the stock biomass (B(i)) determined by sequential
   population models (SPA) (T(i) = 0.477B(i)0.638, r = 0.99, P < 0.01). 
   Biomass forecasts for 1982-90 derived from this function (inverted) were
   positively correlated with recent SPA-based estimates (r = 0.94, P <
   0.02).  For Gulf cod, the index was a 4-yr weighted and lagged moving

   for the years 1974-81 (T(i) = -3.19 + 0.0217B(i), r = 0.99; P < 0.01). 
   Biomass forecasts for 1982-90 were positively correlated with (but lower

AB The geometrid moth, Milionia basalis pryeri Druce, is an important pest
   of Podocarpaceae trees that has recently become established in the
   southern part of the main island of Kyushu, Japan. The species exhibits
   a multivoltine seasonal life cycle, with adults emerging mostly from
   spring to autumn, and occasionally being observed in winter. In this
   study, life-history traits and overwintering success were examined for a
   population collected in southern Kyushu. A long-day photoperiodic
   response was shown in larval and pupal development, with larvae and
   pupae developing significantly more slowly under short-day conditions
   than under long-day conditions. The critical photophases for this
   response were 12-13 h/day at 20 degrees C and 10-12 h/day at 25 degrees
   C. In the field, only individuals that pupated at a particular time in
   autumn remained in the pupal stage during winter, but all of them failed
   to eclose normally to adults, although some of them attained the wing
   pigmentation stage in winter to spring. This maladaptive seasonality in
   M. basalis pryeri in southern Kyushu is attributed to inconsistency
   between the climate of the new habitat and the innate ability of M.
   basalis pryeri to respond to seasonal cues, and is considered to be an
   ecological cost of a range-expanding insect.

AB In previous research, it was determined that the altitude of origin
   altered the parameters of photic entrainment and free-running
   rhythmicity of adult locomotor activity of the high-altitude Himalayan
   (haH) strain (Hemkund-Sahib, 4121 in above sea level) of Drosophila
   helvetica compared to the low-altitude Himalayan (laH) strain (Birahi,
   1132 in above sea level) of the same species. The present study
   investigated whether the altitude of origin also affects the parameters
   of the light pulse phase response curve (PRC) of the adult locomotor
   activity rhythm of the haH strain. Light pulse PRCs were determined for
   both strains against the background of constant darkness. Although both
   were "weak" or type I PRCs, the PRC for the haH strain differed from
   that of the laH strain in three basic parameters. The PRC for the haH
   strain was of low amplitude, had a protracted dead zone, and showed a
   ratio of the advance to delay region (A/D > 1), while the PRC of the laH
   strain was characterized by high amplitude, absence of dead zone, and a
   A/D ratio < 1. The asymmetric PRCs of these strains might explain the
   process of photic entrainment to 24 h light-dark cycles, as the long
   period of the free-running rhythm (tau) of the haH strain is
   complemented with a larger advance portion of its PRG (A/D > 1), whereas
   the short T of the laH strain is matched with a larger delay portion of
   its PRC (A/D < 1). Prolonged dead zone and low amplitude in the PRC of
   the haH strain imply that the photic sensitivity of this strain has been
   drastically diminished as an adaptation to environmental conditions at
   the altitude of its origin. While adults of this strain begin activity
   in very bright light in the forenoon due to non-permissible low
   temperature in the morning, the converse is true for the IaH strain.

AB Changing environmental conditions in the Arctic have caused widespread
   but disparate changes in the relative abundances of diatoms in the
   Cyclotella sensu lato group since 1850 across Arctic lakes. To better
   understand the mechanisms behind these species changes, we investigated
   how the nutrient limitation status of a lake alters the responses of
   three common Cyclotella sensu lato taxa to light. To assess this, we
   collected source water with the natural phytoplankton assemblages from
   lakes in southwest Greenland with different nutrient limitation status
   (phosphorus (P)-limited or nitrogen & phosphorus (N&P) co-limited). The
   responses of Lindavia bodanica, Lindavia radiosa, and Discostella
   stelligera to light levels (low, moderate, or high) and nutrients
   (limited or replete) were tested using a factorial design. The vertical
   distributions of these taxa across 20 lakes of varying nutrient
   limitation status and water transparency were also assessed. We found
   that light affected Cyclotella growth rates, cell densities, and
   distribution patterns differently depending on lake nutrient limitation
   status. L. bodanica fared best at low light under P-limitation, and at
   high light under N&P co-limitation, while the pattern was generally
   opposite for D. stelligera. For L. radiosa, regardless of nutrient
   limitation status, moderate-to-high light was important, with this
   species absent from lakes with lower light conditions. This study
   reveals that environmental change affects these species via complex
   interactions between nutrient and light availability, and helps to
   clarify some of the complex distribution patterns of planktonic diatom
   taxa found in lakes of many areas around the Arctic as well as at lower
   latitudes.

AB Recently a divergence between tree-ring parameters from
   temperature-limited environments and temperature records has been
   observed worldwide but comprehensive explanations are still lacking.
   From a dendroclimatic analysis performed on a high-altitude tree-ring
   network of Pinus cembra (L.) in the Central Italian Alps we found that
   site aspect influences non-stationary growth-climate relationships over
   time. A general increasing divergence between ring width and the summer
   temperature record (J-A) has been observed especially for chronologies
   from SW-facing slopes, whereas chronologies from N-facing sites showed
   stable relationships over time. The monthly analysis revealed that the
   decrease in sensitivity was mostly accounted for by the changes in the
   relationships with June temperature (decreasing correlations especially
   for S- and W-facing site chronologies), whereas trees from N-facing
   sites showed an increasing sensitivity to July temperatures. Our data
   suggest that at high altitudes, low temperatures at the beginning of the
   growing season no longer limit growth. We also found that our
   temperature-sensitive trees did not linearly respond in radial growth to
   the extreme heat event of summer 2003, and formed an annual ring of
   average width, resulting in a strong divergence from the temperature
   record. Our findings underline the importance of site ecology for
   tree-ring based climate reconstructions using temperature-sensitive
   ring-width chronologies, and may help in solving the 'divergence
   problem'.

AB Aim The treeline is an obvious ecotone between forest and tundra
   ecosystems. Climatic warming is expected to lead to the treeline
   advancing, although in many cases this has not been observed. This is
   most likely because other factors can also influence treeline dynamics,
   notably land use and herbivory in European treelines. In this study, the
   roles of climate and herbivory as determinants for change in stem
   number, growth and mortality responses of treeline ecotone trees were
   investigated.
   Location Thirty-six sites along a 1,000 km latitudinal gradient in the
   Scandes Mountains in Norway (60-69 degrees N).
   Methods We recorded changes in stem numbers and height, and mortality
   between 2008 and 2012. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS)
   was carried out to find the relative importance of groups of variables
   representing climate, herbivory, site and tree properties for explaining
   the variation in these three response variables. We also fitted general
   additive models for each response with selected variables from the PLS
   analysis.
   Results We found an increase in number of stems and tree height for
   short and medium tall trees. The climatic variables explained the
   greatest proportion of the variation of the change in stem numbers,
   while tree height growth and mortality were best predicted by the growth
   stage of the tree and climate.
   Conclusions Our study shows that climate explains more of the variance
   in treeline performance than herbivory, tree properties or latitude.
   Relatively weak explanatory power of all variables suggests high context
   dependency of treeline dynamics between sites. It seems that at large
   scales, variables known to be important in regulating treeline dynamics
   within sites are poor predictors of treeline change in the short term.

AB A key goal in the study of animal personalities is to determine their
   adaptive potential and importance for behavioral evolution. Behavioral
   syndromes are evolutionarily intriguing because they suggest that an
   adaptive change in one behavior requires a concomitant shift in another.
   Within species, behavioral syndromes might be evolutionarily constrained
   by intrinsic mechanisms that restrict behaviors from evolving
   independently. Alternatively, behavioral correlations might easily be
   decoupled over short evolutionary time scales due to variation in
   selective pressures between environments. In this regard, comparative
   studies that explore differences in diverse aspects of personality
   between geographically distinct populations can provide valuable
   insights into the evolutionary processes acting on different behavioral
   tendencies. Accordingly, we investigated how behavioral types and
   behavioral syndromes differed across four geographically distinct
   populations of the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. We found
   strong evidence of mean trait-level variation in activity, exploration,
   and boldness across populations, suggesting adaptation to local
   environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that within-population
   correlations involving boldness varied substantially between
   populations. However, we did find a consistent within- and
   among-population correlation between activity and exploration,
   suggesting that this behavioral syndrome is relatively stable and could
   explain behavioral divergence in activity and exploration between
   populations. We suggest that there may be thermal physiological
   mechanisms that could be limiting the adaptive potential of an
   activity-exploration correlation in the delicate skink. Broadly, we
   argue that some behavioral correlations may be more adaptive than
   others, and that this should be more regularly considered within the
   animal personality framework.

AB Background: Current models aimed at predicting the effect of climate
   change on future species distributions assume that all populations of a
   species are an undifferentiated collection of individuals with each
   individual having a tolerance range equal to that of the entire species.
   This assumption overestimates a species' ability to cope with climate
   change, but data to support better models are available only for a few
   species with commercial value. An alternative to detailed studies of
   intra-specific variation in plasticity is to identify global patterns in
   phenotypic plasticity. One such pattern may be the climatic variability
   hypothesis (CVH), which states that physiological flexibility should
   increase with climatic variability, and thus with latitude.
   Goal: Evaluate the latitudinal pattern predicted by the climatic
   variability hypothesis.
   Definitions: Routine metabolic rate (RMR) is the daily metabolic rate of
   an individual. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) is the minimum metabolic
   rate needed to sustain life processes at a given temperature.
   (Typically, RMR is nearly twice SMR.) Let metabolic scope (i.e. RMR SMR)
   be a measure of physiological flexibility (see Naya et aL, 2012).
   Methods: Download mass- and temperature-independent SMR and RMR for 38
   fish species from the Fish Base. Regress the metabolic scope of species
   against their body length, trophic position, distributional mid-point,
   distributional range, maximum depth, environmental temperatures, and
   thermal range within the distributional area.
   Results: Metabolic scope was positively correlated with species'
   distributional range and marginally correlated with the thermal range
   within species' distributional area.
   Conclusion: Given the pattern of variation in climatic variability with
   latitude in aquatic ecosystems, we expected that physiological
   flexibility in aquatic organisms should be closely related with species'
   distributional range rather than with latitudinal distributional
   mid-point, as was indeed the case for metabolic scope.

AB The ability of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to undergo cold
   acclimation is an important determinant of its persistence in mixed
   swards since growth rate at low temperatures sustains higher clover
   contents at the start of spring. During a re-growth period following
   defoliation, a gradual exposure of the root system (cv. Grasslands Huia)
   led to some physiological and morphological changes of cold-adaptive
   significance, similar to those developed by clover ecotypes originating
   in northern areas of Europe. Thus, cold exposure of the root system
   resulted in small-leaved prostrate forms of white clover after one month
   of re-growth. Similarly, cold exposure increased the ability of plants
   to store nitrogen since the application of low temperatures to the root
   system enhanced soluble protein accumulation in roots and in stolons.
   More specifically, cold exposure of the roots induced gene expression of
   a vegetative storage protein (17.3 kDa VSP) in both organs. These
   results demonstrate that the root system of clover plants should be a
   site of perception of the low-temperature stimulus, and gave rise to the
   question of the transduction of the cold signal from the roots to the
   aerial parts. On the basis of this study and taking into account
   molecular aspects concerning the clover VSP, it is suggested that this
   protein could participate in cold acclimation in addition to its role in
   nitrogen storage.

AB The garden tiger moth (Arctia caja) was once widespread and common in
   the UK. Data collected using the standard light-traps of the Rothamsted
   Insect Survey over Great Britain from 1968 to 1998 showed that A. caja
   abundance fluctuated near 4.2 captures per site until 1983, and then
   fell 28% to an average of 3.0 captures per site after 1984. The collated
   index, frequently used to monitor UK butterfly abundance, was not
   suitable to detect this large, 1-year population change. Four years
   after the sudden decrease in abundance, the proportion of sites occupied
   also fell rapidly from an average of 0.60 to an average of 0.42 (30%).
   Contrary to most UK butterflies, which are expected to increase under
   the UK climate change scenarios of global warming, linear regression
   modelling showed that warm, wet winters and springs may be detrimental
   to A. caja and it is therefore predicted to decrease further. (C) 2002

AB Bidens pilosa L. var. radiata, an invasive plant in Taiwan, is
   distributed into mountain area. In contrast to B. pilosa var. radiata,
   B. pilosa var. minor is a naturalized plant and distributed mainly in
   mid-altitude of the island. This study aims to (1) investigate
   phenotypic variations between low- and mid-altitudinal populations of
   these two varieties of B. pilosa, and (2) evaluate the causes,
   environmental effect or genetic differentiation, of the variations. Two
   populations, one from low-(500 m) and the other from mid- altitude (1300
   on 600 m) along an elevation gradient in central Taiwan, of both
   varieties were selected for the study. We compared ecophysiological
   traits of field populations and of progeny of these populations
   cultivated in a common garden.
   For both varieties, mid-altitudinal populations had significantly higher
   chlorophyll and N contents, more positive delta C-13 values and larger
   seeds than low-altitudinal populations. However, most of the phenotypic
   variations between altitudinal populations disappeared in common
   garden-grown plants. The results suggested that these variations were
   phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in environmental factors
   associated with altitudes. Comparing between populations of the same
   variety, seeds of the var. minor collected from mid-altitudinal
   population germinated faster. In contrast, seeds of the var. radiata
   from mid-altitudinal populations germinated slower and required more
   days to germinate. Thus, seeds produced by the mid-altitudinal
   population of the var. radiata had inferior germination performance,
   which might reduce its competitive ability at mid-altitude. However,
   high degree of phenotypic plasticity would allow B. pilosa var. radiata
   to spread into mountain area.

AB Movements undertaken by marine organisms occur for varying reasons and
   knowledge surrounding them is critically important for understanding
   population structures, ecology and for effective management and
   conservation of species. The objective of this study was to test a
   hypothesis that the cubozoan jellyfishAlatina alataspends a large part
   of its life at great depths by utilising the recently validated
   technique of statolith elemental chemistry. The approach was to
   ground-truth estimates of temperature based on a previous manipulative
   laboratory-based experiment, determine Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios in the
   statoliths ofA. alataat different life-history stages and use elemental
   chemistry as an environmental marker to estimate their life-time
   movements. High Sr:Ca values in the core and edge of the statoliths were
   found which corresponded with the time jellyfish were in shallow waters.
   Ambient water temperatures estimated for the end period of the
   jellyfish's lives closely matched known sea surface temperatures in
   Hawaii, hence supporting a correlation between statolith Sr:Ca and
   temperature. For the middle section of the statoliths, strong evidence
   from both Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios suggested that the jellyfish reached
   depths of at least 200-400 m. Ba:Sr maxima further supported this as Ba
   concentrations are usually higher below the thermocline. Individual
   Sr:Ca tracks also suggested that individuals moved over a depth range of
   tens to hundreds of meters through undertaking regular vertical
   movements. This study demonstrates that the use of elemental chemistry
   within cubozoan statoliths has the potential to determine vertical and
   horizontal movements where temperature gradients are strong.

AB The abundance and recruitment of anchovy Engraulis spp. and sardine
   Sardinops spp. alternate in a synchronized way across the Pacific.
   Convergent cross mapping (CCM) indicated that climate change drives the
   alternation of the two species in the California Current System.
   However, climate indices patterns in the western North Pacific contrast
   with those in the eastern North Pacific, despite synchronous species
   alternations occurring. Therefore, it is of great interest to clarify
   whether climate change, or any other factors, affects the population
   dynamics of Japanese anchovy and Japanese sardine in the western North
   Pacific. Using CCM, we tested whether climate change and interspecific
   interactions affect the population dynamics of these two species. We
   found that climate change affected recruitment, and we clarified the
   spatiotemporal pattern of this effect. This result supports the existing
   hypotheses that population dynamics are regulated by climate change in
   the western North Pacific. The present study also detected interspecific
   interactions between sardine and anchovy, which might promote the
   alternation of the two species, and has not been reported in other
   regions.

   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and their stoichiometry
   for 13 Quercus species from 41 study sites in China, aiming to document
   the patterns of leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio to investigate
   how these patterns vary with geographic and climatic variables. The
   averages of leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio were 17.27 mg
   g(-1), 1.54 mg g(-1) and 13.96, respectively, across all Quercus species
   studied. Significant differences in leaf N and P concentrations were
   detected, while no significant difference in leaf N:P ratio was found
   among species. Leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio showed
   single-peak curves or linear patterns along the geographic and climatic
   gradients. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the first
   PCA axis, which reflected the temperature and evaporation variations
   along the altitude and longitude, had good relationships with leaf N and
   P concentrations and N:P ratio. The second PCA axis, which reflected
   temperature and moisture variations along the latitude, only showed a
   significantly correlation with leaf N concentration. Leaf N:P ratio was
   well constrained to a relatively stable range for Quercus species and
   was less influenced by environmental variables. Leaf N and P
   concentrations were mainly driven by heat and water distribution induced
   through geographic variations. Leaf stoichiometry-geography
   relationships are more complicated than stoichiometry-climate
   relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Classical budburst models (Spring Warming, Sequential, Parallel and
   Alternating) are unable to fully predict external data, partly because
   of the methods of optimization used to adjust them. The purpose of this
   study was to examine different assumptions of budburst models and select
   those which are best supported by the data, defining new models able to
   predict external data. Eight models, each differing in one assumption,
   were fitted and tested using external data. The dataset used to test the
   models was deduced from aeropalynological data at two stations in
   France. The results show that some of the models proposed are able to
   accurately predict external dates of flowering of most of the studied
   species. The assumptions of those models have been individually tested
   and shown to improve the models accuracy. Robust estimates of the best
   predictor models of 12 tree species are presented. The analysis of
   hypothetical provenance transfer of two species, Buxus sempervirens and
   Platanus acerifolia, between the two study sites, shows that P.
   acerifolia estimates are similar in both environments whereas B.
   sempervirens estimates are variable. This result, which agrees with the
   genetic characteristics of both species, shows that local adaptation of
   phenology can also be studied through modelling approaches.

AB In seasonal climates, germination timing is mainly controlled by
   temperature, especially in species with physiological seed dormancy. The
   germination response to temperature may, however, vary among populations
   across the distribution range of species. Understanding how populations
   along climate gradients vary in their sensitivity to temperature is
   important for determining their vulnerability to climate variability and
   change. Here, we investigated the germination response of two Erica
   species with physiological seed dormancy (E. australis and E. umbellata)
   to changes in temperature throughout the seasons (simulated autumn
   through to spring) and to the local climate in six localities across a
   latitudinal gradient in western Iberia. Effects were studied with and
   without exposing the seeds to a heat shock. The local climate of seed
   provenance emerged as a key factor in modifying the germination
   sensitivity to germination temperature and their variation through the
   seasons. Although each species showed idiosyncratic germination
   responses to temperature treatments and across the gradient, germination
   of both species was sensitive to warmer temperatures and to a heat
   shock. Both showed similar seasonal germination patterns: as we moved
   from south to north, populations tended to have a larger germination
   peak in spring, which was greater at colder temperatures. We conclude
   that rising temperatures associated with climate change will affect
   these species, particularly at their northern ranges, where many seeds
   will remain dormant during warmer winters. Arguably, models aiming at
   assessing climate change impacts in these species need to include such
   variability across latitude.

AB While ectothermic organisms often experience considerable circadian
   variation in body temperature under natural conditions, the study of the
   effects of temperature on metabolic rates are traditionally based on
   subjecting animals to constant temperature regimes. Whether data
   resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts
   temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes
   remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting
   metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus)
   under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of
   temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25
   degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes
   with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between
   thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate
   measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at
   the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature.
   Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on
   rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our
   results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial
   attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its effects over
   functional traits. Such approach provides a more solid support for
   inferences about temperature effects on the life history, ecology and
   conservation of ectothermic organisms.

AB A spatiotemporal trend analysis of different magnitudes related to the
   number and length of the dry spells in Catalonia (NE Spain) has been
   conducted based on daily rainfall records taken from 40 rain gauges
   during the second half of the 20(th) century. Dry spells have been
   computed for threshold levels of 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 mm/day at annual and
   semi-annual scales. The winter half-year is defined from October to
   March and the summer half-year from April to September. The magnitudes
   considered are the number, the maximum length and the mean length of the
   dry spells for every year and half-year. The spatial patterns of the
   average values of these magnitudes at the annual scale show a greater
   similarity with those of the summer half-year than with those of the
   winter half-year. A S-N or SW-NE gradient of the number of dry spells
   appears during the summer half-year for every threshold level. Trends of
   the analysed magnitudes are derived from linear regression and local
   statistical significances at the 95% confidence level are established
   using the Mann-Kendall test. Field significant trends are investigated
   by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The most relevant finding is that
   the number of dry spells per year depicts significant trends for the
   annual and winter-half series, with an overall decreasing trend for 5
   and 10 mm/day thresholds. These observed trends are in agreement with

AB BackgroundNatural and managed soils have been identified as the largest
   sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the quantification
   of N2O emissions from soils under natural vegetation in China and their
   possible responses to changing climate and atmospheric nitrogen
   deposition remains uncertain. In particular, information regarding N2O
   emissions from Chinese shrublands is lacking.MethodThis study used 28
   sets of N2O field measurements in China to validate a process-based
   dynamic nitrogen cycle model (DyN-LPJ), which was then used to
   investigate the N2O fluxes from soils under natural vegetation in China
   from 1970 to 2009.ResultsN(2)O emissions from Chinese forests,
   grasslands, and shrublands in the 2000s were estimated to be 0.100.06 Tg
   N yr.(-1), 0.09 +/- 0.09, Tg N yr.(-1) and 0.14 +/- 0.07 Tg N yr.(-1),
   respectively. Monthly N2O fluxes were linearly correlated with
   precipitation, and exponentially (Q(10)=3) with air temperature. The
   total N2O fluxes from natural terrestrial ecosystems in China increased
   from 0.28 +/- 0.03 Tg N yr.(-1) in the 1970s to 0.46 +/- 0.03 Tg N
   yr.(-1) in the 2000s. Warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition
   accounted for 37% (or 0.07 +/- 0.03 Tg N) and 63% (0.11 +/- 0.01 Tg N)
   of this increase respectively.Conclusions Our results indicate that when
   compared to grassland ecosystems, N2O emissions from forest and
   shrubland ecosystems contain larger uncertainties due to either their
   uncertain areal extent or their emission rates. Long-term and continuous
   field measurements should be conducted to obtain more representative
   data in order to better constrain shrubland N2O emissions.

AB Temperature is one of the most important environmental variables for
   organisms, especially for ectothermic animals. In fact, ectotherms must
   move within a relatively narrow range of temperatures where they are
   able to maximize their performance. We assessed the thermal ecology of
   female sand spiders (Sicarius thomisoides) in Chile from separate
   populations along an environmental gradient and different macro habitats
   (coast vs. inland locations). The parameters of thermal performance
   curves do not vary between populations, with an average optimum
   temperature (T degrees(opt)) of 25.33 +/- 2.65 degrees C, and a CT (min)
   and CT (max) of 6.56 +/- 1.72 degrees C and 44.23 +/- 4.92 degrees C,
   respectively. Our results show that the thermal niche in laboratory is
   conserved and does not vary along an environmental gradient coinciding
   with the temperatures selected by female spiders in their microhabitats.

   Almost similar result was obtained in Glass house assay where
   Carbendazim was proved to be best followed by all other fungicides at

   with Foc showed that Pseudomonas fluorescens had more mycelial growth
   inhibition of pathogen (Foc) with 70.94 % inhibition over control.
   Trichoderma harzianum was proved to be second best followed by Rhizobia
   spp. and Bacillus subtilis with 63.95%, 60.79% and 57.68% growth
   inhibition respectively. In glass house assay Pseudomonas fluorescens
   was proved to be most effective on one moderately resistant variety
   (Noor 91) and two susceptible varieties (Pb2000 and ICC131-21) showed
   highly disease reduction percentage with mean 76.78 over un-inoculated
   control. Comparative study of biological control agents and fungicides
   showed that both are almost equally effective against chickpea wilt

AB The Douglas fir provenance Three Valley was found most suitable for
   planting in mid-Sweden. Greenhouse tests can most likely predict how
   different Douglas fir provenances will perform in the field.
   The need for species that will grow well through ongoing climate change
   has increased the interest in Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
   Franco] in Sweden. One of the most common problems seen in plantations
   of Douglas fir seedlings is damage caused by late spring frost, known to
   be highly correlated with the timing of bud burst. The objective of this
   study was to investigate spring-related bud development under Nordic
   conditions of seven Douglas fir provenances and to compare data with a
   local provenance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Results from
   a field trial and a greenhouse-based study were compared. The interior
   Douglas fir provenances exhibited an earlier bud burst than coastal
   provenances, both in the greenhouse and in the field trial. When
   comparing differences within the groups of interior and coastal Douglas
   fir provenances, no differences could be found. The local Norway spruce,
   only grown in the greenhouse, showed an intermediate bud development
   profile similar to the interior Douglas fir provenance Three Valley. We
   therefore suggest that Three Valley could be planted at the same
   locations as the investigated local provenance of Norway spruce in
   mid-Sweden. To avoid spring frost damage the Douglas fir seedlings need
   to be frozen stored and planted late in spring. Planting under
   shelterwood can also help protect the seedlings from spring frost
   damages. As similar results for bud development patterns of Douglas fir
   and Norway spruce provenances were obtained from the greenhouse and
   field trials, greenhouse tests could facilitate selection of
   provenances.

AB Biofilaments like F-actin or microtubules, as well as cilia, flagella,
   or filament bundles, are often deformed by distributed and
   time-dependent external forces. It is highly desirable to characterize
   these filaments' mechanics in an efficient way, either using a single
   experiment or a high throughput method. We here propose a dynamic power
   balance approach to study nonequilibrium filament dynamics and exemplify
   it both experimentally and theoretically by applying it to microtubule
   gliding assay dynamics. Its usefulness is highlighted by the
   experimental determination of the lateral friction coefficient for
   microtubules on kinesins. In contrast to what is usually assumed,
   friction is anisotropic, in a similar fashion as hydrodynamic friction.
   We also exemplify, by considering a microtubule buckling event, that if
   at least one parameter is known in advance, all other parameters can be
   determined by analyzing a single time-dependent experiment.

AB The growing season of alpine grassland is regarded as the vital
   indictors reflecting the vegetation growth, and is sensitive to regional
   climatic change in Northern Tibet. However, limited studies have
   identified the growing season variability across alpine grassland in
   Northern Tibet during 2001-2018. We investigated spatial-temporal
   variations in the growing season of alpine grassland in Northern Tibet,
   as determined by TIMESAT model employing MODIS NDVI data. Results
   indicate that, the start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season
   (EOS) and growing season length (GSL) for alpine grassland experienced
   delaying, advancing and shortening trends at a rate of 1.32, -2.06 and
   -3.38 days/10a, respectively, in the Northern Tibet. The variation of
   growing season in different alpine grassland types showed different
   changing tendencies. The SOS for alpine grassland was significantly
   positively correlated with the mean temperature and negatively
   correlated with the cumulative precipitation from January to May. The
   EOS for alpine grassland was positively correlated with temperature and
   precipitation in September. These results could contribute to the
   research on plant phenology and climate change from a different
   perspective. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The reproductive ecology of two eastern Pacific zooxanthellate coral
   species was examined as part of a continuing series of studies relating
   bleaching/mortality events caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   disturbance, and is described for study sites in Costa Rica, Panama, and
   the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). This study deals with the sibling
   agariciid species Pavona varians and Pavona sp.a over a 13 yr period
   (1985 to 1997). Both pavona species are broadcast-spawners with some
   gonochoric, but mostly sequential hermaphroditic colonies. Minimum
   colony sizes (and ages) at first reproduction were 5 cm (5 yr) and 3 cm
   (2 to 3 yr), respectively, in P. varians and Pavona sp.a. In the Panama
   and Galapagos populations, gonochoric colonies spawn eggs or sperm at
   least monthly. Six fecundity attributes were not significantly different
   in the two species, but the eggs of P. varians are white to beige and
   positively buoyant, and those of Pavona sp.a are dark green and
   neutrally to negatively buoyant. Eggs of both species lack
   zooxanthellae. Both species are reproductively active year-round, with
   maximum activity in the dry season in the nonupwelling Gulf of Chiriqui,
   and in the wet season in the upwelling Gulf of Panama. Spawning is
   predominantly during full moon, and possibly also at new moon at most
   study sites. Spawning in P. varians and Pavona sp.a is 12 h out of
   phase, with the former species spawning similar to 1h before sunrise and
   the latter about 1h after sunset. The fecundity of Pavona spp. at Cano
   and the Galapagos Islands was much greater (19900 to 27900 eggs cm(-2)
   yr(-1)) than at all Panama sites (14800 to 19800 eggs cm(-2) yr(-1)).
   Intraspecific crosses in both species resulted in swimming planula
   larvae after 25 to 36 h. Recruitment of P. varians was highest in
   Panama, moderate in Costa Rica, and nil in the Galapagos Islands,
   matching, respectively, the contributions of P. varians to the
   pre-1982/1983 El Nino coral-population abundances in these areas.
   Recruitment success of P. varians at Uva Island was significantly
   related to maximum monthly positive sea surface-temperature (SST)
   anomalies that occurred in the year preceding recruitment over the
   period 1982 to 1996; recruitment failed when SST anomalies exceeded 1.6
   to 1.9 C degrees during the severe ENSO events of 1983/1983 and
   1997/1998.

AB The abiotic environment varies continuously at a variety of temporal
   scales. While this variation is known to be ecologically important,
   multiple scales of variability are rarely explicitly considered in
   ecological studies. Here, we combine field observations and laboratory
   experiments to determine the individual and population level effects of
   short-term (tidal) and longer-term (seasonal and interannual) salinity
   variation on the dogwhelk Nucella lamellosa in the Strait of Georgia,
   British Columbia, Canada. The Fraser River heavily influences surface
   salinity in the Strait of Georgia, which varies with season, depth, and
   distance to the river mouth. At low salinity sites, N. lamellosa
   population size decreased following high outflow years, with fewer
   juveniles present, as opposed to high salinity sites, which had higher
   population densities in all years. Sustained salinity exposure in the
   laboratory caused developmental delay of encapsulated embryos and
   complete mortality at 9 and 12 psu. Juvenile dogwhelks (<30 mm shell
   length) and those from a high salinity site experienced higher mortality
   in low salinity conditions than larger individuals and those from a low
   salinity site. The inclusion of a 3 h daily exposure to 20 psu,
   simulating high tides in a stratified water column, enabled N. lamellosa
   to survive otherwise low salinity conditions for considerably longer.
   Overall, our results suggest that seasonal and interannual variation in
   salinity have a profound influence on N. lamellosa populations and that
   shorter-scale fluctuations can moderate these seasonal and interannual
   effects. It is likely that similar multi-scale environmental effects
   will determine survival and population dynamics in many species.

AB Spatial variation in biological traits reflects evolutionary and
   biogeographical processes of the history of clades, and patterns of body
   size and range size can be suitable to recover such processes. In the
   present study, we test for latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in both
   body and range sizes in an entire family of tropical anurans,
   Centrolenidae. We partition the species latitudinal, and altitudinal
   distributions into an indirect measure of tolerance, and then test its
   effect on the body size gradient. We use an assemblage-based approach to
   correlate the traits with altitudinal and latitudinal axes, taking into
   account both phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation in data.
   Centrolenids lack any gradient in range size but show a positive cline
   of both body size and adaptive body enlargement with altitude. This
   pattern is also positively correlated with an altitudinal gradient of
   cold tolerance, thus lending support to the heat balance hypothesis as
   an explanation of the body size cline. By using an entire Neotropical
   clade of anurans, we add further support for Bergmann's rule in
   ectotherms, warn for a likely effect of environmental steepness in
   fashioning the gradient, and offer evidence for an historical scenario
   (the OligoceneEocene Andean uplift) as its likely trigger.(c) 2013 The

   Research cruises were undertaken during the favourable upwelling season
   (May to October) in 2000 and 2001. Each cruise included biological and
   hydrographic sampling and consisted of five stations in waters located
   to the east and west of the Cies Islands. A total of 221 paralarvae of
   Octopodidae and Loliginidae were collected over the 12-month study
   period. During 2000, higher abundance of paralarvae was observed in
   July, September and October for Loligo vulgaris and Octopus vulgaris. In
   2001, abundance of both species was higher in May and also in September
   for O. vulgaris. The mantle length of the paralarvae varied from 1.25 to
   2.25 mm and from 1.00 to 4.90 mm within the O. vulgaris and L. vulgaris
   individuals, respectively. The presence/absence of upwelling modulates
   the abundance and spatial distribution of loliginid and octopod
   paralarvae. The relationship between the distribution and movement of
   these paralarvae in the Ria of Vigo seems to follow the circulation
   system defined for this area; when the upwelling extends its influence
   inside the Ria, the paralarvae are transported to the inner part in a
   west-east direction.

AB Coastal ecosystems of Bushehr are shallow environments subject to human
   impacts, including shrimp aquaculture and urban expansion activities. A
   spatial-temporal study was conducted in order to assess the actual
   ecological status of the creeks, estuary and marine sites on the basis
   of their taxonomic composition and density of mesozooplankton.
   Zooplankton species distribution and abundance data at 6 sampling sites
   during June 2015 - March 2016 revealed 24 taxa represented by 5
   divergent groups. During the study period, high salinities (around 35-47
   PSU) were recorded, characterizing all systems as a coastal-marine
   ecosystem, rather than true estuarine.
   The mesozooplankton assemblage was characterized by the dominant marine
   Copepod, Labidocera sp., zoeas of coastal/marine crab, Ilyoplax frater,
   marine copepod Acartia fossae and a marine pelagic tunicate, Oikopleura
   dioica. Copepods were the main dominant group and Labidocera sp. the
   most abundant species, with high abundances in winter, whereas high
   abundances of the Ilyoplax frater were noticed in summer. Based on
   SIMPER analyses, highest dissimilarity was observed between Ramleh and
   Lashkary and discriminating taxa for all sites were Labidocera sp
   followed by Ilyoplax frater contributing to more than 68% of the total
   average dissimilarities for all locations. The multivariate BIO-ENV
   procedure indicated that Labidocera sp. followed by Acartia fossae
   strongly correlated to the variability of depth, transparency and
   salinity. Finally the results showed that temporal and spatial variation
   in the mesozooplankton community is consistent with the dynamic
   character of the habitat characterized as a typical coastal marine
   system (with low average depths, transparency and high salinity).

AB Treelines are expected to rise to higher elevations with climate
   warming; the rate and extent however are still largely unknown. Here we
   present the first multi-proxy palaeoecological study from the treeline
   in the Northwestern Swiss Alps that covers the entire Holocene. We
   reconstructed climate, fire and vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee, an
   alpine lake at 2,065 m a.s.l., by using seismic sedimentary surveys,
   loss on ignition, visible spectrum reflectance spectroscopy, pollen,
   spore, macrofossil and charcoal analyses. Afforestation with Larix
   decidua and tree Betula (probably B. pendula) started at similar to
   9,800 cal. b.p., more than 1,000 years later than at similar elevations
   in the Central and Southern Alps, indicating cooler temperatures and/or
   a high seasonality. Highest biomass production and forest position of
   similar to 2,100-2,300 m a.s.l. are inferred during the Holocene Thermal
   Maximum from 7,000 to 5,000 cal. b.p. With the onset of pastoralism and
   transhumance at 6,800-6,500 cal. b.p., human impact became an important
   factor in the vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee. This early evidence of
   pastoralism is documented by the presence of grazing indicators (pollen,
   spores), as well as a wealth of archaeological finds at the nearby
   mountain pass of Schnidejoch. Human and fire impact during the Neolithic
   and Bronze Ages led to the establishment of pastures and facilitated the
   expansion of Picea abies and Alnus viridis. We expect that in mountain
   areas with land abandonment, the treeline will react quickly to future
   climate warming by shifting to higher elevations, causing drastic
   changes in species distribution and composition as well as severe
   biodiversity losses.

AB The interannual distribution of early life stages of Pacific hake
   Merluccius productus, within the southern part of the California Current
   (32-23 degrees N) from 1951 to 2001, was examined to describe the
   relationship between spawning habitat and environmental conditions. Mean
   annual abundance was affected by different factors along the west coast
   of the Baja California Peninsula. In the northern areas (Ensenada and
   Punta Baja), reduced abundance of larvae coincided with the El Nino and
   a North Pacific Ocean climatic regime shift, but in the southern areas
   (San Ignacio to Baja Magdalena), the drastic reductions suggested a
   fishery effect for large adults of the coastal migratory population,
   starting in 1966. Two spawning stocks, coastal and dwarf, were evident
   in comparisons of latitudinal differences in occurrence of early stages
   and differences in temperature preferences that seemed to break at Punta
   Eugenia.

AB Heterogeneous environments are typically expected to maintain more
   genetic variation in fitness within populations than homogeneous
   environments. However, the accuracy of this claim depends on the form of
   heterogeneity as well as the genetic basis of fitness traits and how
   similar the assay environment is to the environment of past selection.
   Here, we measure quantitative genetic (QG) variance for three traits
   important for fitness using replicated experimental populations of
   Drosophila melanogaster evolving under four selective regimes: constant
   salt-enriched medium (Salt), constant cadmium-enriched medium (Cad), and
   two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or
   spatially (Spatial). As theory predicts, we found that Spatial
   populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations
   or those maintained in a constant environment that is the same as the
   assay environment. Contrary to expectation, Salt populations tend to
   have more genetic variation than Cad populations in both assay
   environments. We discuss the patterns for QG variances across regimes in
   relation to previously reported data on genome-wide sequence diversity.
   For some traits, the QG patterns are similar to the diversity patterns
   of ecological selected SNPs, whereas the QG patterns for some other
   traits resembled that of neutral SNPs.

AB Background and Aims Most current thermal-germination models are
   parameterized with subpopulation-specific rate data, interpolated from
   cumulative-germination-response curves. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the relative accuracy of three-dimensional models for
   predicting cumulative germination response to temperature.
   Three-dimensional models are relatively more efficient to implement than
   two-dimensional models and can be parameterized directly with measured
   data.
   Methods Seeds of four rangeland grass species were germinated over the
   constant-temperature range of 3 to 38 degrees C and monitored for
   subpopulation variability in germination-rate response. Models for
   estimating subpopulation germination rate were generated as a function
   of temperature using three-dimensional regression, statistical gridding
   and iterative-probit optimization using both measured and
   interpolated-subpopulation data as model inputs.
   Key Results Statistical gridding is more accurate than three-dimensional
   regression and iterative-probit optimization for modelling germination
   rate and germination time as a function of temperature and
   subpopulation. Optimization of the iterative-probit model lowers
   base-temperature estimates, relative to two-dimensional
   cardinal-temperature models, and results in an inability to resolve
   optimal-temperature coefficients as a function of subpopulation.
   Residual model error for the three-dimensional model was extremely high
   when parameterized with measured-subpopulation data. Use of measured
   data for model evaluation provided a more realistic estimate of
   predictive error than did evaluation of the larger set of
   interpolated-subpopulation data.
   Conclusions Statistical-gridding techniques may provide a relatively
   efficient method for estimating germination :response in situations
   where the primary objective is to estimate germination time. This
   methodology allows for direct use of germination data for model
   parameterization and automates the significant computational
   requirements of a two-dimensional piece-wise-linear model, previously
   shown to produce the most accurate estimates of germination time.

AB The adaptive significance of colour polymorphisms in animals has
   received extensive scientific attention. In snakes, a generally accepted
   hypothesis is that melanistic individuals enjoy thermal advantages
   compared to normal coloured individuals. Elaphe quadrivirgata on
   Yakushima Island exhibits a distinct melanistic/striped colour
   dimorphism. To test this hypothesis, the thermal biology of free-ranging
   E. quadrivirgata was investigated using temperature-sensitive radio
   transmitters. The thermal quality of habitats was also evaluated using
   physical models of the snake. In addition, the species' set-point range
   (T-set) was estimated using a laboratory experiment. In July, thermal
   environments appear to be benign because snakes were able to maintain
   their body temperature (T-b) within T-set from the midday to evening by
   using average thermal habitats. By contrast, later months of the year
   were severe in thermoregulation, and snakes had difficulty maintaining
   their T-b within T-set by using average thermal habitats. There were no
   significant intermorph differences in thermoregulation indices in any
   months, whereas slight differences were detected in hourly comparisons.
   Most of these comparisons indicated active and precise thermoregulation
   (with respect to T-set) in striped individuals by using thermally
   favourable but rare microhabitats such as forest gap. Thus, the obtained
   values do not support the prediction that melanistic individuals are
   precise thermoregulators. Yet, melanistic individuals do modify their
   thermoregulation strategy with respect to the available thermal
   environments in contrast to striped individuals. Together with the fact
   that body heating is slower in striped individuals than in melanistic
   individuals under experimental conditions, it is concluded that
   melanistic individuals have the potential to enjoy thermal advantages
   but that this might be of no practical use in terms of T-b in the wild
   because of the greater thermoregulatory efforts of striped individuals,
   and because melanistic individuals may use forest gap rarely due to
   conspicuousness to visually orientated predators under the exposed
   habitat. (C) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Interspecific and intraspecific variation in the body sizes of
   warm-blooded animals is usually correlated with geographical gradients
   (latitude and/or altitude) according to the well-known Bergmann's rule.
   However, what determines conformity to Bergmann's rule or even whether
   this rule is valid has been debated. We tested the relationships between
   skull size of the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) collected from
   different geographic localities and two geographic variables (latitude
   and altitude) as well as some environmental factors that usually change
   with geographical gradients oil the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our results
   indicated that skull size was positively correlated with both latitude
   and altitude, and negatively correlated with annual temperature, annual
   precipitation,and annual net primary production. These results indicated
   conformity to Bergmann's rule in this species, i.e., the body size of
   the plateau pika tends to increase with climate severity and food
   scarcity.

AB Bromus tectorum L, (cheatgrass) is an invasive winter annual whose seeds
   lose dormancy through dry after-ripening. In this paper a thermal
   after-ripening time model for simulating seed dormancy loss of B,
   tecforum in the field is presented. The model employs the hydrothermal
   time parameter mean base water potential (psi(b)(50)) as an index of
   dormancy status. Other parameters of the hydrothermal time equation (the
   hydrothermal time constant theta(HT), the standard deviation of base
   water potentials sigma(psi b), and the base temperature T(b)) are held
   constant, while psi(b)(50) is allowed to vary and accounts for changes
   in germination time-course curves due to stage of after-ripening or
   incubation temperature. To obtain hydrothemal time parameters for each
   of four collections, seeds were stored dry at 20 degrees C for different
   intervals, then incubated in water (0 MPa) or polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   solutions (-0.5, -1.0, -1.5 MPa) at 15 and 25 degrees C, Germination
   data for the thermal after-ripening time model were obtained from seeds
   stored dry in the laboratory at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 degrees C for
   0 to 42 weeks, then incubated at two alternating temperatures in water.
   Change in psi(b)(50) was characterized for each collection and
   incubation temperature as a linear function of thermal time in storage.
   Measurements of seed zone temperature at a field site were combined with
   equations describing changes in psi(b)(50) during after-ripening to make
   predictions of seed dormancy loss in the field. Model predictions were
   compared with values derived from incubation of seeds retrieved weekly
   from the field site. Predictions of changes in psi(b)(50) were generally
   close to observed values, suggesting the model is useful for simulating
   seed dormancy loss during after-ripening in the field.

AB The bryopsidalean alga Halimeda gained an important role as carbonate
   producer in Cenozoic tropical coral reefs and became a significant
   constituent of the modern Mediterranean seaweed flora. There are,
   however, open questions at which time the thermophile alga appeared in
   the cooler Mediterranean Sea and why it is not detected in coral reefs
   of the modern Persian Gulf. To unravel the biogeography and ecology of
   Halimeda at its northern margin of distribution, we use fossil Halimeda
   records of the Central Paratethys/Medditerranean for comparison of the
   geological, (palaeo)ecological and evolutionary dispersal constraints of
   the alga in the Miocene and Holocene Persian Gulf. The revealed spatial
   and temporal distribution patterns of Halimeda in the regions of the
   Mediterranean and Arabian seas identify water temperature as the major
   ecological constraint and the extreme Plio-Pleistocene climate changes
   as the motor for the dispersal and evolution of Halimeda in higher
   latitudes. Generally, the distribution of tropical species in higher
   latitudes was related to warm climate intervals during the Neogene.
   Accordingly, the available (palaeo)biogeographic data implies that the
   warm-adapted ancestors of the present-day Mediterranean H. tuna
   population possibly entered the Mediterranean Sea during the
   mid-Pliocene global warmth and became isolated during subsequent
   cooling. It also implies that the warm Persian Gulf water is probably
   unsuitable for the cool-adapted H. discoidea population in the Gulf of
   Oman and that its tropical ancestors could have reached the Gulf of Oman
   only during a Pleistocene glacial phase when monsoon-induced upwelling
   of cold water in the Arabian Sea was reduced and the Persian Gulf fell
   dry. This example demonstrates the limitation of the actualistic
   palaeontological approach when using biota at the edges of their
   distribution range as palaeoclimate proxy. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

   some photosynthetic parameters and light and CO2 photosynthesis response
   curves for all plant communities with seven dominant species in 13 sites
   along an elevation gradient in the Qilian Mountains in arid northwestern
   China. 'I he results showed that species in xerothermic environments had

   rates (5.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and high maximum photosynthetic rates
   (Amax) (18.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) compared with species in mesic
   environments. Photosynthesis parameters did not vary with temperature,
   precipitation, and altitude in different communities dominated by the
   same species, Picea crassifolia. However, some photosynthesis parameters
   varied with temperature, precipitation, and altitude in communities
   dominated by species other than spruce at different elevations. Selected
   photosynthesis parameters could be used to measure species adaptation to
   environmental gradients in arid mountain regions.

   shorelines of an elongated 22 km 2 lake basin, on a range of bathymetric
   slopes (1-16%). A first set of substrates was deployed at eight sites
   during early stratification (June 19, 2004) and were sampled after 4, 11
   and 20 days and 5.5 and 11 weeks to compare colonisation, establishment,
   early growth rate and density of mature populations. The second set of
   substrates was deployed at 16 sites in mid-summer (July 26) and was
   sampled after 5.5 weeks. The density of A. minutissimum and their
   average cell length were measured in all samples. Thermocline movements
   were calculated using a 3D hydrodynamic model, which was calibrated
   offshore in the lake basin and validated at each sampling site.
   3. Achnanthidium colonised the open substrates very rapidly. Initial
   cell densities increased with increasing thermocline movement,
   especially along shallow bathymetric slopes. These results suggest an
   inverse relationship between thermocline-induced nearshore turbulence
   and bathymetric slope.
   4. The density of early colonisers was reduced by 30-95% during the
   establishment period (411 days after substrate deployment), suggesting
   that Achnanthidium needs time to attach firmly to the substrate and is
   vulnerable to disturbances during that period. Achnanthidium established
   most efficiently at upwind nearshore sites exposed to more thermocline
   movement.
   5. The early growth rate of Achnanthidium in nearshore areas was
   negatively related to mean water temperature, a likely surrogate for
   nutrient availability at the sediment-water interface.
   6. The density of Achnanthidium in mature populations was positively
   related to thermocline movements and showed a negative interaction with
   bathymetric slope early in the stratification period, but not later in
   summer. These results suggest that physical forces associated with
   thermocline movements interact differently with the bottom in nearshore
   areas as the season progresses and as the water-column stabilises.
   7. The size of Achnanthidium cells increased during settlement and early
   population growth, peaked in early July at most sites and decreased over
   the rest of the summer. This common pattern of seasonal change in
   Achnanthidium cell sizes suggests a strong factor synchronising its life
   cycle across the whole lake basin.
   8. Thermocline movements over nearshore substrates clearly affect the
   colonisation and population development of A. minutissimum. These
   results support the idea that wind-driven physical forces are a major
   factor structuring nearshore habitats in lakes, even in the lower
   littoral zone, and that benthic organisms should distribute themselves
   in a predictable way around lake basins.

AB The chemical composition of shells of the planktonic foraminifer
   Globigerinoides ruber (white) is frequently used to determine past sea
   surface conditions. Recently, it has been shown that arbitrarily defined
   morphotypes within this species exhibit different chemical and isotopic
   signatures. Here, we investigate the occurrence through time and in
   space of morphological types of G. ruber (white) in late Quaternary and
   Holocene sediments of the central and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In
   115 samples representing two distinct time intervals (MIS 1-2 and MIS
   9-12) at ODP Site 964 and the Riston core GeoTu-SL96, we have defined
   three morphological types within this species and determined their
   relative abundances and stable isotopic composition. A quantitative
   analysis of morphological variation within G. ruber (white) in four
   samples revealed that the subjectively defined morphotypes occupy
   separate segments of a continuous and homogenous morphospace. We further
   show that the abundance of the morphotypes changes significantly between
   glacials and interglacials and that the three morphotypes of G. ruber
   show significant offsets in their stable isotopic composition. These
   offsets are consistent within glacial and interglacial stages but their
   sign is systematically reversed between the two Sites. Since the
   isotopic shifts among the three G. ruber morphotypes are systematic and
   often exceed 1%., their understanding is essential for the
   interpretation of all G. ruber-based proxy records for the
   paleoceanographic development of the Mediterranean during the late
   Quaternary. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
