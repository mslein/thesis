AB This study investigated the main causes of population abundance
   fluctuations. Particularly, attention was paid to whether a
   density-dependant factor, such as a stock-recruitment relationship (S-R
   relationship) or a density-independent factor such as an environmental
   factor, is more important. Using data pertaining to the number of eggs
   of the Pacific stock mackerel and information about regime shifts and
   sea surface temperature, the shape of the S-R relationship was discussed
   and these shapes with the results of simulation trails were compared.
   Further other historical S-R relationship data were analyzed. The
   results are as follows: (i) a new mechanism that causes population
   fluctuations could be proposed, that is, (a) the recruitment is
   proportional to the spawning stock biomass (SSB) and the relation is
   expressed by several lines with the same slope, and (b) the shift
   between the lines occurs due to environmental conditions; and (ii) the
   density-dependent S-R relationship, which suggests that recruitment
   decreased due to high density in SSB, proposed by Ricker or Beverton and
   Holt, would not exist.

AB Cathemeral animals distribute their activity more or less uniformly
   between the dark and light phases of the 24-hour day. This activity
   pattern is quite widely observed among major mammal taxa, although the
   number of species involved is relatively low. Among primates,
   cathemerality is seen principally, though not uniquely, in the
   strepsirhine ("lower primate") family Lemuridae; it is ubiquitous in the
   genus Eulemur, among species of which it seems to be a stable activity
   pattern with a history going back at least 8-12 million years. Nocturnal
   primates have visual systems that accentuate sensitivity to light over
   visual acuity, showing large cornea size, high rod:cone ratios and large
   numbers of photoreceptors relative to ganglion cells. Diurnal forms do
   the reverse, while Eulemur species are intermediate in these respects,
   suggesting substantial accommodation of the visual system to the
   cathemeral lifestyle. Studies of one Eulemur species have revealed that
   its cathemerality is underpinned by a robust endogenous circadian timing
   mechanism with a free-running periodicity of over 25 hours. The lemurs
   appear to be entrained to the 24-hour day by the light/dark cycle,
   plausibly with dusk as the primary zeitgeber. The causes of
   cathemerality have been sought in such environmental influences as
   predator avoidance, energy conservation, dietary quality, and
   interspecies feeding competition. All of these factors seem to be
   relevant to the cathemeral lifestyle, but none appears to be a crucial
   determinant. Nothing is known of the underlying neural mechanisms that
   facilitate the lemurs' accommodation to the extremes to which 24-hour
   activity exposes them.

AB Life history theory in ornithology has been mostly based on temperate
   birds in part because a relative paucity of biological data has been
   described for tropical species. Expanding our knowledge about life
   histories of tropical birds can help us to better understand global
   trends in life history strategies. To aid in this endeavor, we studied
   Mountain Wren-Babblers (Gypsophila crussus) breeding in Malaysian Borneo
   from 2009 to 2017. Relatively small (mean = 28.8 g), dark brown birds,
   they were cooperative breeders and foraged and cared for the nest in
   groups of typically 4 or 5 birds. We located 145 nests, which were
   globular and partially domed (91.8 mm mean opening height accounted for
   half of 180.7 nun total mean nest height), constructed from fern fronds
   on the outside and dead leaves on the inside, and most often placed on
   banks. Brooding attentiveness decreased with nestling age and was rare
   after day 7 once they began growing their primary feathers. Provisioning
   rate slightly increased with nestling age. Nestling growth rate
   constants were typical of many tropical birds, asymptoting a few days
   prior to fledging. Predation accounted for nearly all nest failures (87
   of 88), with a daily nest predation rate for the total nesting period of
   0.056 and nest success decreasing with elevation. Daily predation rate
   was highest during lay (0.117) and lowest during incubation (0.046). We
   compared these results with related species to identify potential
   explanations for the trends we described. The most notable result from
   these comparisons was that Mountain WienBabblers have a long incubation
   period (23.5 cf) and adults only incubate for a small part of the day.
   This anomalous behavior emphasizes the importance of understanding the
   great variation in tropical life history strategies to ultimately
   improve life history theory. Received 11 March 2019. Accepted 11 March

AB We have recently shown that the chloroplast small heat-shock protein
   (chlpsHsp) protects oxygen evolution and electron transport of
   Photosystem II during heat stress, bur it is not known if the chlpsHsp
   protects Photosystem II during other stresses. Here we show that the
   chlpsHsp was produced in viva in leaves of Chenopodium album (L.) and
   Lycopersicum esculentum (Mill.) plants subjected to drought (in high
   light, but not in low light), ultraviolet-A radiation, exogenous
   abscisic acid treatment, and oxidative stress (induced by methyl
   viologen). Cold-shock treatment failed to induce the chlpsHsp in either
   species. Using an in vitro antibody-inhibition assay specific to the
   chlpsHsp, we provide evidence that the chlpsHsp can protect Photosystem
   II electron transport from oxidative stress (induced by H(2)O(2)) and
   under conditions of photoinhibitory high light. These results indicate
   that the chlpsHsp plays a general role in the protection of Photosystem
   II against oxidative stress and photoinhibition.

AB Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the commercially most important
   fish species in the North Atlantic and plays a central role in several
   ecosystems. Fishing pressure has been heavy over a prolonged period and
   the recent decades have shown dramatic decline in abundance of many
   stocks. The Arcto-Norwegian (or North-east Arctic) cod stock in the
   Barents Sea is now the largest stock of Atlantic cod. Recruitment to
   this stock has varied extensively during the last 60 yr. There is
   evidence for fluctuations in climate, particularly sea temperature,
   being a main cause for this variability, higher temperatures being
   favourable for survival throughout the critical early life stages. Our
   studies of time series present compelling evidence for a strengthening
   of the climate-cod recruitment link during the last decades. We suggest
   this is an effect of the age and length composition of the spawning
   stock having changed distinctly. The age of the average spawner has
   decreased by more than 3 yr from between 10 and 11 in the late 1940s to
   7-8 in the 1990s, average length from just above 90 cm to around 80 cm.
   The number of age classes contributing to the spawning stock has also
   decreased, while the number of length groups present increased slightly.
   Significant decrease in age of spawners has frequently been described
   for other heavily fished stocks worldwide. We therefore find it likely
   that the proposed mechanism of increased influence of climate on
   recruitment through changes in the spawning stock age and size
   composition is of a general nature and might be found in other systems.

AB The central role of the cytoskeleton in both healthy and diseased
   cellular functions makes it a compelling subject for detailed
   three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical modeling. Microstructural
   features of the cytoskeleton govern the cell's mechanical behavior in
   many of the regulating cellular functions including cell division,
   adhesion, spreading, migration, contraction, and other
   mechanotransductive effects which influence biochemical processes. Actin
   microfilaments (AF) combine to form one of the predominant cytoskeletal
   networks important to these biological processes.
   Here, the AF cytoskeletal microstructure and stress-strain behavior is
   modeled via a microstructurally-informed continuum mechanics approach.
   The force-extension behavior of the individual filaments is captured
   using the MacKintosh derivation of the worm-like chain (WLC)
   constitutive relationship for short chains where a new and direct
   analytical expression for the filament force as a function of filament
   extension is developed in this paper. The filament force-extension
   behavior is then used in conjunction with the Arruda-Boyce eight-chain
   network model to capture the 3D multiaxial stress-strain behavior of the
   network. The resulting 3D cytoskeletal network constitutive model
   provides the ability to track microstructural stretch and orientation
   states during 3D macroscopic stretching conditions. The non-affine
   nature of the network model effectively accommodates the imposed
   macroscopic shear strain through filament rotation and a relatively
   small amount of filament stretch. These characteristics enable the
   network model, using physically realistic material properties, to
   capture the initial stiffness of the AF network as well as the nonlinear
   strain stiffening observed at large stresses. The network model
   predictions compare favorably with published microrheological data of in
   vitro AF networks. (c) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

AB The mode of desaturation of fatty acids in the membrane lipids of
   cyanobacteria was studied by analyzing the composition of fatty acids,
   the distribution of fatty acids at the sn position of the glycerol
   moiety, and the position of double bonds in the fatty acids.
   Cyanobacterial strains can be classified into four groups on the basis
   of the mode of desaturation of fatty acids. Cyanobacteria in Group 1 can
   introduce only one double bond at the DELTA9 position of fatty acids at
   the sn-1 position. Cyanobacteria in Groups 2, 3 and 4 are characterized
   by a unique positional distribution of fatty acids; the C18 and C16
   fatty acids are esterified, respectively, to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions
   of the glycerol moiety. In Group 2, the C18 acid is desaturated at the
   DELTA9, DELTA12, and DELTA15 positions and the C16 acid is desaturated
   at the DELTA9 and DELTA12 positions; in Group 3, the C18 acid is
   desaturated at the DELTA6, DELTA9, and DELTA12 positions; and in Group
   4, the C18 acid is desaturated at the DELTA6, DELTA9, DELTA12, and

   Both unicellular and filamentous strains are distributed among all four

AB A network of 24 beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) tree-ring chronologies has
   been developed for the Italian peninsula. Principal component and
   cluster analyses were used to identify geographical and altitudinal
   patterns of tree growth. Correlations and response functions were then
   applied to the main modes of tree-ring variability to uncover climatic
   signals. In a landscape occupied by humans for millennia, this approach
   provided a detailed quantitative ecological characterization of forest
   types. Altitude was significantly correlated with dendrochronological
   parameters. The Alps and northern Apennines could be distinguished from
   the central-southern Apennines. In central Italy, we recognized three
   different vegetation belts occupied by beech forests, from low- to
   high-elevation sites. Summer drought impacted beech growth with
   different intensity at different elevations, depending on the onset and
   duration of the growing season. Moreover, low-elevation beech forests
   showed a distinct late spring climate signal, which was opposite to that
   of high-elevation sites. The coherent geographical and ecological
   patterns of tree-ring variability suggest that dendrochronological
   networks help define bioctimatic zones and forest types. (C) 2005

AB Plants restricted to active sand dunes possess traits that enable both
   survival in a harsh environment and local migration in response to a
   shifting habitat mosaic. We examined seed bank dynamics of Penstemon
   haydenii S. Watson (blowout penstemon) in relation to local sand
   movement. We measured within-year sand movement along a 400 m transect
   and examined plant density, seed production, and seed density in
   relation to this movement. Plant densities were highest in areas of
   moderate sand movement. Annual seed rain averaged 13 seeds.m(-2),
   whereas persistent seed bank density (0-10 cm depth) averaged only 0.1
   seeds.m(-2). A laboratory burial experiment with nondormant (chilled)
   seeds showed that most deeply buried seeds (>6 cm) were held in enforced
   dormancy under spring conditions, while seeds at intermediate depths
   (4-6 cm) were induced into secondary dormancy that was broken by
   subsequent drying and re-chilling, thus promoting seed carryover until
   the following spring. Most near-surface seeds produced seedlings.
   Enforced and secondary dormancy provide mechanisms for maintaining a
   persistent seed bank of more deeply buried seeds that could become part
   of the active seed bank as sand movement re-exposes them near the
   surface. This could facilitate both population persistence and migration
   as previously occupied habitat becomes unsuitable.

AB The widely documented phenomenon of nighttime stomatal conductance g(sn)

   remains unclear whether nighttime stomatal conductance confers a
   functional advantage. Given that studies of g(sn) have focused on
   controlled environments or small numbers of species in natural
   environments, a broad phylogenetic and biogeographic context could
   provide insights into potential adaptive benefits of g(sn). We measured
   g(sn) on a diverse suite of species (n = 73) across various functional
   groups and climates-of-origin in a common garden to study the
   phylogenetic and biogeographic/climatic controls on g(sn) and further
   assessed the degree to which g(sn) co-varied with leaf functional traits
   and daytime gas-exchange rates. Closely related species were more
   similar in g(sn) than expected by chance. Herbaceous species had higher
   g(sn) than woody species. Species that typically grow in climates with
   lower mean annual precipitation - where the fitness cost of water loss
   should be the highest - generally had higher g(sn). Our results reveal
   the highest g(sn) rates in species from environments where neighboring
   plants compete most strongly for water, suggesting a possible role for
   the competitive advantage of g(sn).

AB The north-western Mediterranean Sea's high biodiversity originates from
   a mixture of temperate and subtropical species. Large-scale warming has
   been detected through northward range shifts of 'warm-water' species,
   and mass-mortality events for 'cold-water' invertebrates. Marine caves
   are affected in a more subtle way. By monitoring endemic species of cave
   mysids (Crustacea) and comparing our results with data in the
   literature, we observed a strong decline in one species, coupled with
   the success of another. Near Marseille (France), this phenomenon began
   while two major thermal anomalies were reported. Different tolerances to
   temperature were demonstrated by both the species distribution ranges
   and laboratory experimentation. We provide a possible physiological
   explanation for populations of cold stenothermal species of endemic cave
   mysids being replaced by congeners of warmer affinities, with a high
   risk of extinction. We also found strong support for the view that
   Mediterranean marine biodiversity is already under the threat of global
   warming.

AB The goal of this study was to examine the responses of the zooplankton
   community to the establishment of an OWF, the causes of any observed
   effects, and their relation to environmental factors in the study area.
   This article describes the results of an investigation into the
   zooplankton community and the main environmental factors affecting that
   community based on data obtained from three cruises in May, August, and
   November of 2015 in the area of the Longyuan OWF in Rudong, China. This
   study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of zooplankton, including
   data obtained before the construction of the wind farm, to assess any
   postconstruction change in the zooplankton community. Data from the
   zooplankton community were analyzed using canonical correlation
   analysis, redundancy analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The
   analysis indicates that the presence of the wind turbine foundations
   reduced the quantity of the macrozooplankton significantly (the
   percentage of change was 96.87% in the autumn, and 26.70% in the
   spring), and reduced the biomass slightly in autumn (the percentage of
   change was -58.20%) or increased the biomass in the spring (the
   percentage of change was 75.77%). However, the quantity of the
   microzooplankton significantly increased (the percentage of change was
   542.76% in the spring) or decreased slightly (the percentage of change
   was -86.25% in the autumn). The water also showed a postconstruction
   trend toward eutrophication in this study area. The data also showed
   that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter

AB The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has undergone significant changes
   in air and seawater temperatures during the last 50 years. Although
   highly stenotherm Antarctic organisms are expected to be severely
   affected by the increase of seawater temperature, high-resolution
   datasets of seawater temperature within coastal areas of the WAP ( where
   diverse marine communities have been reported) are not commonly
   available. Here we report on within-year (2016-2017) variation in
   seawater temperature at three sites on Doumer Island, Palmer
   Archipelago, WAP. Within a year, Antarctic organisms in South Bay were
   exposed to water temperatures in excess of 2 degrees C for more than 25
   days and 2.5 degrees C for more than 10 days. We recorded a temperature
   range between 1.7 degrees to 3.0 degrees C. Warming of seawater
   temperature was 3.75 times faster after October 2016 than it was before
   October. Results from this study indicate that organisms at South Bay
   are already exposed to temperatures that are being used in experimental
   studies to evaluate physiological responses to thermal stress in WAP
   organisms. Continuous measurements of short to long-term variability in
   seawater temperature provides important information for parametrizing
   meaningful experimental treatments that aim to assess the local effects
   of environmental variation on Antarctic organisms under future climate
   scenarios.

AB Variation in the distribution of animals across the landscape, within
   and between habitats, can occur at a variety of scales. At the smallest
   scale, individuals can either be positioned randomly or can be
   orientated in regard to variables. Differences in orientation can, for
   many animals, directly affect their reproductive success and/or
   survivorship, and these effects may have downstream ecological
   consequences. Organisms may orientate themselves in a specific way in
   response to varying environmental conditions or habitat properties;
   alternatively they may consistently orientate in a specific direction.
   The present study investigated patterns of orientation during low tide
   in the intertidal marine limpet Cellana tramoserica on steeply sloped
   rocky surfaces (>60 degrees to the vertical). We also examined whether
   individual limpets consistently orientated in the same direction or if
   orientation was dependent upon their orientation during the previous low
   tide. There was a downward bias in orientation. Mensurative and
   manipulative experiments measuring limpet orientation over different
   days showed that individual limpets did not consistently orientate in
   the same direction and that their orientation was independent of their
   orientation during the previous low tide. Thus, whilst limpets on slopes
   often orientate with their heads downwards, there is much inherent
   individual variation in the orientation patterns exhibited by resting
   limpets. Simple mechanistic explanations such as responses to
   desiccation are unlikely to be sufficient to explain why limpets choose
   different orientations at the end of foraging excursions. These findings
   have implications for understanding limpet distributions on rocky shores
   and downstream ecological consequences.

AB Assessments of future tree species' distributions should account for
   time lags in the adaptation of their external range limits to climatic
   changes. In simulation experiments it is therefore necessary to capture
   processes that influence such time lags, in particular tree species'
   migration. We hypothesise that directional processes such as migration
   are sensitive to the exact sequence of simulated climate influences, and
   that the uncertainty associated with a given interannual climate
   variability has to be accounted for when simulating migration
   explicitly. In this paper we used the intermediate-complexity
   multi-species model TreeMig to examine whether different realisations of
   future climate influences with the same temporal mean and the same
   interannual variability cause fundamental differences in simulated
   migration. We assume that the impact of interannual climate variability
   becomes most apparent in situations which critically influence
   regeneration and survival. Such situations arise, for example, when
   species' sensitivities to climate, competition and spatial fragmentation
   interact. We therefore developed an illustrative and realistic
   simulation setup representing this situation. We simulated the
   northwards migration of the sub-Mediterranean tree species Ostrya
   carpinifolia Scop. (European Hop Hornbeam) through the highly fragmented
   and climatically heterogeneous landscape of the Swiss Alps.
   Situations critically influencing regeneration and survival can lead to
   low species' abundances. Before investigating effects of interannual
   climate variability, we therefore tested whether the continuous
   representation of species' cell populations in TreeMig, which allows for
   infinitesimal population densities, can have side effects on simulated
   migration. Specifically, we tested for effects of minimum density
   thresholds, i.e. thresholds below which a species is treated as absent.
   We found that small threshold s in the magnitude of one individual per
   km(2) cell have a considerable impact on simulated migration, and can
   even impede migration in situations critical for regeneration and
   survival.
   To test for effects of interannual climate variability, we compared
   simulation results from multiple repetitions driven by different annual
   climate time series generated stochastically from the same probability
   distribution. Results from these repetitions were additionally compared
   to results from simulations driven by cyclically repeated climate and
   steadily applied mean climate, respectively. These comparisons were
   conducted for different species parameter sets within the plausible
   parameter range of O. carpinifolia to account for potential interactions
   between species' sensitivities and the environment. Simulated tree
   species' migration was highly dependent on the species parameters
   applied and markedly influenced by interannual climate variability.
   Notable divergence in species' spread resulted amongst multiple
   realisations of annual climate time series stochastically sampled from
   the same probability distribution. We conclude that uncertainty
   associated with interannual climate variability has to be accounted for.
   Single realisations can be insufficient and mean value simulations as
   well as averages of output results can be too simplistic to reflect
   possible outcomes of tree species' migration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB There is strong evidence for a shifting of range boundaries by many
   temperate butterfly species to higher altitudes and latitudes. Climate
   change represents a potential threat to mountain fauna. Nevertheless,
   information on ecophysiological limits of individual species is scarce.
   We studied the lower thermal limits of four species representing the
   prevailingly mountain Holarctic butterfly genus Erebia. We measured the
   cold tolerance of hibernating larvae, namely the supercooling point
   (SCP) and the lower lethal temperature (LLT). Three mountain species
   were freeze avoiding, with various levels of SCP (-8 to 22 degrees C),
   and LLT close to SCP. The only exception was lowland E. medusa, whose
   caterpillars were freeze tolerant with LLT (-21 degrees C) slightly
   below its SCP (-17 degrees C). Surprisingly, LLT was highest in the
   alpine E. tyndarus and lowest in E. medusa inhabiting lower altitudes
   with higher mean winter temperatures. We explain the observed reversed
   altitudinal cline in cold hardiness by the buffering function of snow
   cover in the hibernacula of caterpillars that is strong at high
   mountains but irregular, unpredictable and thus unreliable in lowlands.

AB Fecundity of three Rhynchosia minima populations was compared. The

   vacant lot while the population in a natural undisturbed shrub-dominated
   community showed lowest fecundity and average output weight.
   Variation in seed weight within and between populations was
   demonstrated. The implications of seed size variation are discussed.
   Seeds have water impermeable seed coats and thus they have physical
   dormancy. Physical scarification with sand paper was more effective in
   breaking seed dormancy than chemical scarification with hydrochloric
   acid. Dry heat treatment (50 degrees and 70 degreesC) markedly increased
   the germination percentage. Under field conditions dry heat during
   summer apparently breaks seed dormancy thereby allowing the seeds to
   germinate in considerable numbers after rain showers.
   Greater germination percentage was observed in light compared to dark.
   Final germination percentage varied with temperature (25 degrees - 40
   degreesC) with the optimum at 35 degrees. Significant inhibition of
   germination occurred at 6, 7, and 8 bar NaCl salinity, while in
   polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000) germination was reduced at 7 and 8 bar.
   At iso-osmotic concentrations PEG 4000 caused lesser inhibitory effect

   physiological and behavioural responses were followed in parallel to the
   environmental manipulations, Some of the experimental conditions studied
   in the tower tank were also reproduced in a swimming respirometer where
   fish oxygen consumption and heart rate were monitored at various levels
   of activity.
   2. Lowering salinity from 30 to 26 parts per thousand did not change
   resting oxygen consumption, but increased active oxygen consumption.
   3. Lowering salinity from 30 to 26 parts per thousand increased heart
   rate over the whole range of swimming speeds except at maximum speed.
   4. Lowering oxygen tension to 9 kPa decreased oxygen consumption over
   the whole range of swimming speeds and decreased resting heart rate.
   5. Low salinity did not significantly affect the relationship between
   heart rate and oxygen consumption.
   6. Low oxygen levels decreased the oxygen transported per heart beat.
   7. In the tower tank, bursts of activity were associated with
   tachycardias.
   8. In uniform conditions, fish swam more deeply during the day than at
   night.
   9. After an exploratory period of approximately 6 h, fish chose to
   remain in a low-salinity upper layer of the tank, Thereafter, high
   salinities were avoided, Fish tended to select low salinities if a
   choice was provided,
   10. Fish generally avoided zones of low oxygen (<9 kPa) but continued

   from Baja California to Alaska for 1899-1988. For winters since around
   1940, downwelling has intensified along Alaska and northern British
   Columbia, while upwelling has increased along Baja California. Fl Nino
   events induced strong winter coastal downwelling poleward of 40 degrees
   N. During summer, upwelling has increased since around 1940 along
   southern British Columbia to Baja California, while from 1899 to 1940,
   upwelling declined along southern California to Baja California.
   Empirical orthogonal function analysis of the AWS showed that the first
   mode consisted of the AWS at the eight stations all varying in-phase,
   while the second mode had the northern four stations out-of-phase with
   the southern four stations. Off southern British Columbia, correlations
   between coastal sea level and AWS and between sea surface temperature
   and AWS were both strong during winter but insignificant during summer.
   In contrast, correlation between salinity and alongshore wind stress was
   insignificant during fall and winter, but strong during spring and
   moderate during summer. Summer AWS was positively correlated with both
   the fatness of sardine and the condition factor of herring off British
   Columbia.

AB Background: The impact of environmental gradients on the evolution of
   life history traits is a central issue in macroecology and evolutionary
   biology. A number of hypotheses have been formulated to explain factors
   shaping patterns of variation in animal mass. One such example is
   Bergmann's rule, which predicts that body size will be positively
   correlated with latitude and elevation, and hence, with decreasing
   environmental temperatures. A generally accepted explanation for this
   phenotypic response is that as body mass increases, body surface area
   gets proportionally smaller, which contributes to reduced rates of
   heat-loss. Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic evidence reveals that
   endotherms follow Bergmann's rule. In contrast, while previous
   non-phylogenetic studies supported this prediction in up to 75% of
   ectotherms, recent phylogenetic comparative analyses suggest that its
   validity for these organisms is controversial and less understood.
   Moreover, little attention has been paid to why some ectotherms conform
   to this rule, while others do not. Here, we investigate Bergmann's rule
   in the six main clades forming the Liolaemus genus, one of the largest
   and most environmentally diverse genera of terrestrial vertebrates. A
   recent study conducted on some species belonging to four of these six
   clades concluded that Liolaemus species follow Bergmann's rule,
   representing the only known phylogenetic support for this model in
   lizards. However, a later reassessment of this evidence, performed on
   one of the four analysed clades, produced contrasting conclusions.
   Results: Our results fail to support Bergmann's rule in Liolaemus
   lizards. Non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that none of
   the studied clades experience increasing body size with increasing
   latitude and elevation.
   Conclusion: Most physiological and behavioural processes in ectotherms
   depend directly upon their body temperature. In cold environments,
   adaptations to gain heat rapidly are under strong positive selection to
   allow optimal feeding, mating and predator avoidance. Therefore,
   evolution of larger body size in colder environments appears to be a
   disadvantageous thermoregulatory strategy. The repeated lack of support
   for Bergmann's rule in ectotherms suggests that this model should be
   recognized as a valid rule exclusively for endotherms.

AB Preferential temperature as a physiological feature is crucial for
   spiders, since it determines the selection of key habitats for their
   survival and reproduction. In this work, we study the daily and
   geographical variation of the preferential temperature of the spider
   Sicarius thomisoides subjected to different degrees of daily thermal
   oscillation in their habitats. Preferred temperatures differ between
   coastal and inland populations, but in both cases, there is a marked
   bimodality in the daily pattern of temperature preference, with two
   peaks per day that would be given by the changes in the hours of
   activity. These nocturnal spiders select higher temperatures in the
   evening (active period) and select lower temperatures during late
   morning (resting period). In laboratory, spiders have preferred
   temperatures that differ from those found in their habitats, so they
   must tolerate or compensate non-preferred temperatures by active
   thermoregulation in natural conditions.

   interannual variability of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from
   the previous September to current July (PDSIp9-7) for the past 278
   years. The reconstruction explained 41.3% of the variance (40.3% after
   adjusting the degrees of freedom) of the actual interannual variability
   of the PDSI during the calibration period (1951-2012 AD). The spectral
   analyses revealed 3.5-, 2.6-, 2.3-, 2.1- and 2-year quasi-cycles at a
   95% confidence level and 7.9-, 7.1- and 5.2-year quasi-cycles at a 90%
   confidence level. The PDSI reconstruction series was consistent with
   several reconstructed climatic series based on the tree-ring chronology
   in neighboring regions. The PDSIp9-7 exhibits excellent regional
   representativeness, which indicates the consistency of the drought
   variation of the central part of the monsoon margin area in north China,
   whereas PDSIp9-7 can represent the drought history of the central part
   of the north monsoon margin area. In addition, significant relationships
   were found between the PDSIp9-7 series and the Arctic Oscillation, North
   Atlantic Oscillation, El Nio-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation series, which indicates that the PDSI variation in the study
   area was influenced by a combination of these factors.

AB Context The effects of global climate change are threatening
   biodiversity, with particular concern for amphibians, whose survival
   often depends on specific abiotic conditions. To predict how future
   climate change will affect amphibian populations, it is first necessary
   to understand how patterns of abundance are shaped by multiple
   environmental conditions at both local and regional scales.
   Objectives Plethodontid salamander are a group of lungless ectotherms
   that require cool and moist habitats to survive. While the broad
   elevational distribution and abundance patterns are well-understood,
   other important abiotic gradients exist within montane systems that are
   contributing to fine-scale spatial abundance patterns. We aim to assess
   the fine-scale spatial abundance of a plethodontid salamander across two
   key environmental gradients: temperature and moisture.
   Methods We conducted area-constrained repeated point-count surveys at
   plots situated across temperature and moisture gradients in western
   North Carolina. Each plot was surveyed on 4 occasions, and site and
   survey-level covariates were measured.
   Results We found heterogeneous abundance patterns across these two
   gradients whereby warmer low elevations contain the greatest abundance
   near stream sides, where conditions are cooler and wetter than the
   regional landscape. At cooler, higher elevations, salamanders are
   distributed more uniformly across the broader landscape, likely as a
   result of the suitable regional climate.
   Conclusions Fine-scale habitat associations of plethodontids are driven
   by temperature and moisture, and the spatial patterns of suitable
   microhabitats drive regional scale patterns. Incorporating multiple
   environmental gradients provides a more biologically relevant prediction
   of abundance patterns, which will help inform conservation and
   management strategies especially in the context of climate change.

   variation between 2002 and the other study years was evident. Multiple
   regression analysis of V-emax against the climate variables revealed
   that VPD of the previous 10-30 clays had a significant influence oil
   variability ill Neither N-a LMA nor leaf CO2 conductance front the
   stomata to the carboxylation site explained the variability in V-emax.
   Our results indicate that the long-term climatic response of V-emax
   should be considered when estimating forest carbon gain across the year.

AB A juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom) tree-ring width chronology has
   been developed from the west-ernmost forest of the Qilian Mountains. Our
   analyses demonstrate both temperature and precipitation have significant
   effects on tree growth and that both should be considered in climate
   reconstruction. Thus a regional drought history (A.D. 1855-2001) is
   reconstructed by calibrating with a linear interpolation through four
   Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) grid values nearest the sampling
   site. Our reconstruction extends the drought history of this area and
   also reveals that the most severe drought occurred in the 1920s. In the
   context of the drought history of western China. this extreme drought
   between 1925-1931 is consistent over a large surrounding region of
   Northwestern China. Multi-taper spectral analysis reveals the existence
   of significant 40- to 46-year, 29-year, and 2.1- to 3-year periods of
   variability. Overall, our study provides reliable information for the
   research of past drought variability in the Qilian Mountains,
   Northwestern China.

AB The winter diet of the great tit (Parus major) was examined in mixed and
   deciduous forest in central Slovakia during three winters. Using a
   faecal samples analysis, in 105 sampled roosting individuals (in
   nest-boxes) at least 37 taxa of invertebrates were found. Apart from the
   invertebrates, plant material was identified in dissected birds'
   droppings as well. There were no significant differences in the winter
   food composition between sexes. Generally, plant material was the most
   frequent and the most dominant winter food. This component was followed
   by moths, beetles and dipterans. While comparing the relative volume
   between two distinct habitats, the most significant difference was found
   in Lepidoptera adults and plant material. Birds from mixed forest
   foraged less on Lepidoptera adults in contrast to individuals from
   deciduous forest. This could be compensated by bigger consumption of
   seeds and buds there. Regarding seasonal changes, within five winter
   months (from November to March), the relative volume and frequency of
   some invertebrate groups (Heteroptera, Homoptera and Lepidoptera)
   significantly increased with the temperature but no correlations were
   found with other weather characteristics. Invertebrates exhibited the
   opposite seasonal pattern compared to the plant material.

AB The thermal ecology of ectotherms has been studied for almost 2
   centuries, but additional attention is currently being paid to it, to
   understand how organisms deal with the environment in a climate change
   context. A consensus is still far away due to the large number of
   factors involved and their complex interactions. In this context, 3
   analyses in lacertid lizards were carried out: (i) a meta-analysis, to
   test for differences between body and air temperatures from 71
   populations; (ii) a meta-analysis concerning correlations between body
   and air temperatures from 60 populations; and (iii) a multimodel
   inference of thermoregulation effectiveness indices from 45 populations.
   The importance of different factors, including body size, habitat,
   insularity, altitude, climate and season, was evaluated in all analyses
   to model the response variables. A strong seasonality effect was
   observed, with a consistent pattern of less effective thermoregulation
   in summer compared to other seasons. Altitude was the second most
   important factor, with a consistent higher thermoregulation effort in
   populations occurring at high elevations (>1000 m above sea level).
   Other factors, such as insularity or body size, can also be important,
   but did not exhibit a clear pattern. Finally, thermoregulation was less
   affected by climate and habitat type.

   for eight broadly defined vegetation types (Treed Uplands, Treed
   Lowlands, Mixed Tall Shrub/Sedge, Closed-canopied Willow, and
   Open-canopied Willow, Meadow, Wetland Grass, Wetland Sedge) for use by
   wood bison (Bison bison athabascae), a threatened subspecies, in the
   Canadian boreal forest of northern Alberta. Clip plots (n = 108) were
   used to sample peak availability of herbs and Current annual growth of
   Salix spp. in late summer. Graminoid wetlands dominated by Carex
   atherodes, Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata, Scolochloa festucacea, or
   Calaniagrostis stricta produced 1975-4575 kg ha(-1) of fair to good
   quality forage, whereas treed stands produced <250 kg ha(-1) of
   forb-dominated forage (>85% content), which was below a published 25%
   foraging efficiency threshold of 263 kg ha(-1) for bison. Upland forests
   that dominate the region produced <= 1 animal unit day (AUD) of forage
   per hectare in Summer. Most forest understory plants were of poor forage
   value, suggesting the potential Sustainable stocking rate Of Such areas
   was actually <= 0.3 AUD ha(-1), with even lower rates during winter due
   to snow cover. Herbaceous wetlands contained similar to 78 AUD ha(-1) of
   forage, but were considered largely unavailable in summer because of
   flooding and soft organic soils that make access difficult. Conversion
   of prime foraging habitat to agricultural land, forest expansion clue to
   fire control, and a warmer and wetter climatic regime after the
   mid-1900s likely contributed to a regional reduction in carrying
   capacity. It is hypothesized that substantial recovery of the wood bison
   Population toward historical levels will be constrained in northern
   Alberta by the availability of summer forage, and the limited extent of
   graminoid wetlands that provide winter foraging habitat. (C) 2007

   or 32/26 degrees C from newer appearance to seed maturation (daily mean
   temperatures of 25, 27 or 29 degrees C). pollen from MFs was applied
   individually to MS flowers. As MFs were self-pollinated, heat stress was
   experienced by both male and female tissues. At growth temperatures of
   29 degrees C fruit number, fruit weight per plant, and seed number per
   fruit were only 10%, 6.4% and 16.4%, respectively, compared with those
   at 25 degrees C, Heat stress also adversely affected fruitset in MSs,
   especially when experienced by donor pollen. No fruit at all developed
   on MSs receiving pollen produced at 29 degrees C, even when ovule
   development, pollen germination and subsequent embryo development all
   took place at 25 degrees C, Effects on fruitset in MSs were reduced if
   donor pollen had not experienced heat stress. MSs grown at 29 degrees C
   but receiving pollen developing at 25 degrees C produced 73% as much
   fruit (both on number and weight basis), had 40% as high fruitset and
   produced 87% of the seed per fruit as MSs grown at 25 degrees C, This
   use of male-sterile and male-fertile lines of tomato provides new
   evidence that impairment of pollen and anther development by elevated
   temperature will be an important contributing factor to decreased fruit
   set in tomato, and possibly other crops, with global warming.

AB The winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. areas in Sweden (55 to 61 degrees
   N) are at, or close to, the northern border of winter wheat cultivation.
   Yield variations at the county level for 1866 to 2006 are analysed and
   compared with variations in length of winter. Yield deviations greater
   than +/- 25% occur on average once every 5 yr in a county, but more
   often in the north. In a maritime climate such as the one in
   north-western Europe, the length of winter fluctuates considerably.
   Deviations in length of winter by more than +/- 45 d appear on average
   once every 5 yr in a county, but more frequently in the southern coastal
   counties. However, freezing temperatures are also more intermittent
   there compared to the continuous cold in the north. By means of a
   cluster analysis of the variations in length of winter, the counties
   were divided into 4 groups. The general effect is that long winters give
   decreasing yields. Regressions between deviations in yield and length of
   winter show determination coefficients (R-2) in the range of 0.13 to
   0.30, which is high for a single variable. Winters are, on average, 48 d
   longer when yields are 25% below trend compared with yields 25% above
   trend. This pattern seems to be typical for climates with winter
   temperatures < 5 to 6 degrees C.

AB Global circulation models predict and numerous observations confirm that
   anthropogenic climate change has altered high-frequency climate
   variability. However, it is not yet well understood how changing
   patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population
   dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a
   population's long-run growth rate is diminished and the chance of
   population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases.
   This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative
   process and that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean
   of growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic
   mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured populations
   are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers, increasing
   environmental variation can increase a population's long-run growth
   rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated
   with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics
   in different ways. Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might
   result in diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while
   increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long-run
   growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well
   understood and supported by data, the hypothesized effect of temperature
   is not. Here, I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating
   temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with
   the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run
   growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events.

AB Timing and rate of seasonal zone formation in southern North Sea cod
   Gadus morhua otoliths was studied. Samples were taken from two time
   periods, representing low and high temperature regimes. Opaque zones
   were laid down between January and June, in contrast with the pattern
   described in other published studies. Translucent zone formation started
   earlier in the warmer period, corresponding to peak annual sea surface
   temperatures, and a period of slow body growth and low metabolic
   activity. Translucent zone formation, however, continued once
   temperatures decreased and growth rate increased. It is hypothesized
   that translucent zone formation is triggered at a threshold of metabolic
   stress, and that the combined energetic requirements of reproduction,
   growth and migration may maintain translucent zone formation even if
   feeding conditions improve. Higher temperatures had a significant
   negative effect on the rate of translucent zone deposition, but caused a
   slight increase in opaque zone formation rate. The findings of this
   study indicate that historical otolith collections could provide key
   inputs into future phenological studies to improve the understanding of
   climate change impacts and the dynamics of otolith structure.

AB It is hypothesized that in diadromous fish, migrations may occur because
   of differences in the availability of food in marine and freshwater
   habitats. The benefits of migration to sea may be increased growth
   opportunities and reproductive output, while the costs may be increased
   mortality and increased energy use. Here we examine mortality rates of
   anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo
   trutta) in fresh water and at sea over a 25-year period to test these
   hypotheses. Daily mortality rates were 5-15 times higher at sea than in
   fresh water, with highest rates for first-time migrants, inferring a
   clear trade-off between increased mass gain and mortality risk during
   the sea migration. Descending smolts were caught in a trap at the outlet
   of the river, individually tagged, and thereafter recorded each time
   they passed through the trap on their annual migration between the river
   and the sea. Brown trout females seemed to benefit to a higher degree
   from migrating to sea than did female Arctic char, probably because of
   the higher growth rate at sea, and hence higher reproductive output.

AB Aim: Despite several recent efforts to map plant traits and to identify
   their climatic drivers, there are still major gaps. Global trait
   patterns for major functional groups, in particular, the differences
   between woody and herbaceous plants, have yet to be identified. Here, we
   take advantage of big data efforts to compile plant species occurrence
   and trait data to analyse the spatial patterns of assemblage means and
   variances of key plant traits. We tested whether these patterns and
   their climatic drivers are similar for woody and herbaceous plants.
   Location: New World (North and South America).
   Methods: Using the largest currently available database of plant
   occurrences, we provide maps of 200 x 200 km grid-cell trait means and
   variances for both woody and herbaceous species and identify
   environmental drivers related to these patterns. We focus on six plant
   traits: maximum plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, wood
   density, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf phosphorus concentration.
   Results: For woody assemblages, we found a strong climate signal for
   both means and variances of most of the studied traits, consistent with
   strong environmental filtering. In contrast, for herbaceous assemblages,
   spatial patterns of trait means and variances were more variable, the
   climate signal on trait means was often different and weaker.
   Main conclusion: Trait variations for woody versus herbaceous
   assemblages appear to reflect alternative strategies and differing
   environmental constraints. Given that most large-scale trait studies are
   based on woody species, the strikingly different biogeographic patterns
   of herbaceous traits suggest that a more synthetic framework is needed
   that addresses how suites of traits within and across broad functional
   groups respond to climate.

AB Temperature is a major factor affecting population abundance and

   of increase (r) differ in their response to different temperature
   regimes, and much of the difference is mediated by generation time (Tg).
   Here, we evaluate the effects of thermal mean and variability on R-0, r
   and Tg, at four population densities in Drosophila melanogaster. The
   results show that R-0, r and Tg present differential responses to
   thermal variation. Although temperature effects on R-0 and Tg are
   non-linear, r response was negligible. R-0 and Tg comprise a

AB The relationship between the redox state of P700, the primary donor of
   PS I, monitored using absorbance changes at 830 nm and photochemical
   energy storage in PS I reaction centers assayed with the photoacoustic
   method (PA) was studied in isolated PS I submembrane particles aspirated
   onto nitrocellulose filters. Several donors have been used to support
   the electron transport through PS I. NADPH and NADH demonstrated low
   rates of electron donation to PS I, while ascorbate and ascorbate plus
   2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol ( DCIP) couple have been found more
   effective in both P700(+) reduction and stimulation of the variable
   component of the PA signal. A linear relationship was found in isolated
   PS I particles between the (A(830,max) - A(830,steady))/A(830,max) and
   (PA(max) - PA(steady))/PA(max) ratios, which characterized the relative
   amount of P700 in the reduced state and the relative magnitude of the
   variable PA component, respectively. That linear relationship was
   obtained independently from the nature of electron donor used for the
   reduction of P700(+). Such linear relationship was also obtained at
   various wavelengths of modulated light in the range of 660 to 720 nm,
   only the slope of the linear fits varied with wavelength. It is
   concluded that reduced P700 act as a photochemical quencher of absorbed
   energy. Variable thermal dissipation in PS I reaction centers of
   isolated submembrane particles linearly depends on the amount of reduced
   P700 and thus constitutes an appropriate indicator of the redox pressure
   applied to PS I.

AB Understanding the capacity for different species to reduce their
   susceptibility to climate change via phenotypic plasticity is essential
   for accurately predicting species extinction risk. The climatic
   variability hypothesis suggests that spatial and temporal variation in
   climatic variables should select for more plastic phenotypes. However,
   empirical support for this hypothesis is limited. Here, we examine the
   capacity for ten Drosophila species to increase their critical thermal
   maxima (CTMAX) through developmental acclimation and/or adult heat
   hardening. Using four fluctuating developmental temperature regimes,
   ranging from 13 to 33 degrees C, we find that most species can increase
   their CTMAX via developmental acclimation and adult hardening, but found
   no relationship between climatic variables and absolute measures of
   plasticity. However, when plasticity was dissected across developmental
   temperatures, a positive association between plasticity and one measure
   of climatic variability (temperature seasonality) was found when
   development took place between 26 and 28 degrees C, whereas a negative
   relationship was found when development took place between 20 and 23
   degrees C. In addition, a decline in CTMAX and egg-to-adult viability, a
   proxy for fitness, was observed in tropical species at the warmer
   developmental temperatures (26-28 degrees C); this suggests that
   tropical species may be at even greater risk from climate change than
   currently predicted. The combined effects of developmental acclimation
   and adult hardening on CTMAX were small, contributing to a <0.60 degrees
   C shift in CTMAX. Although small shifts in CTMAX may increase population
   persistence in the shorter term, the degree to which they can contribute
   to meaningful responses in the long term is unclear.

AB Ocean warming has been implicated in the observed decline of oceanic
   phytoplankton biomass. Some studies suggest a physical pathway of
   warming via stratification and nutrient flux, and others a biological
   effect on plankton metabolic rates; yet the relative strength and
   possible interaction of these mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we
   implement projections from a global circulation model in a mesocosm
   experiment to examine both mechanisms in a multi-trophic plankton
   community. Warming treatments had positive direct effects on
   phytoplankton biomass, but these were overcompensated by the negative
   effects of decreased nutrient flux. Zooplankton switched from
   phytoplankton to grazing on ciliates. These results contrast with
   previous experiments under nutrient-replete conditions, where warming
   indirectly reduced phytoplankton biomass via increased zooplankton
   grazing. We conclude that the effect of ocean warming on marine plankton
   depends on the nutrient regime, and provide a mechanistic basis for
   understanding global change in marine ecosystems.

AB Understanding the underlying ecological processes that govern population
   dynamics is essential for identifying the risk of extinction faced by a
   population. Ecological processes are driven by a number of different
   density-dependent and density-independent factors. Influential factors
   may vary between species and are often classified for large areas of a
   species' geographical range. Here we test the hypothesis that these
   factors vary on a relatively small spatial scale across a species'
   range. The population dynamics of the large skipper butterfly Ochlodes
   sylvanus is investigated for each 100km(2) region within its British
   range. Different forms of density dependence, including Allee effects,
   and different density-independent factors are found to influence
   population change significantly in different regions. The possible
   underlying mechanisms responsible for each are discussed. In addition to
   this qualitative spatial variation in influencing factors, the relative
   contribution of density dependence and density-independent factors to
   temporal dynamics within each region is quantified. As the range of O.
   sylvanus is crossed from north-west to east, there appears to be a
   switch from density independence being more influential to density
   dependence having a greater impact on population change.

AB Eight soil profiles, either barren or covered with biological soil
   crusts (BSCs), were sampled at multiple depths in a remote valley in the
   Atacama Desert, Chile, to explore the impact of BSCs on soil evolution
   and salt geochemistry. BSC sites had thicker soil profiles compared to
   non-BSC sites, which could be a result of past geological processes and
   also partially accounted for by the establishment of BSCs that can help
   limit erosion and promote significant soil accumulation. The greater
   abundances of fine particles below BSCs. could essentially be attributed
   to the ability of BSCs to trap more fine grains. The generally higher
   salt ion inventories but smaller salt ion concentrations in soil
   profiles beneath BSCs were probably due to that BSCs can promote the
   retention of salt ions and insoluble dust simultaneously, but the latter
   to a greater extent. Nitrate oxygen isotopes indicated the predominant
   existence of atmospheric nitrate in the soils, suggesting biological
   processes of BSCs may not significantly impact the ion accumulation or
   distribution in the underlying soils. A mechanism of consistent soil
   accumulation via the retention of atmospheric deposition and occasional
   interruption of subsurface collapsing due to erosion processes was
   proposed to explain the development of soil profiles and different
   landscape features as well as the role of BSCs in soil evolution in this
   study area. The soil ages were estimated to be around 440 ky based on
   the proposed soil accumulation mechanism.

AB Latitudinal variation in fitness-related traits has often been
   attributed to local adaptation to climates. In poikilotherms including
   fishes, lower temperatures and shorter reproductive seasons at high
   latitudes would be expected to cause a reduction in annual reproductive
   output of an individual. Theories of latitudinal compensation predict
   that organisms at high latitudes should evolve compensatory responses
   for these climatic effects. Therefore, latitudinal compensation in
   female reproductive rate (egg production rate), that individuals from
   high latitudes produce eggs at higher rates than those from lower
   latitudes, is likely to occur. I tested this hypothesis with a
   latitudinally widespread reef fish Pomacentrus coelestis that is a
   multiple batch spawner, from three different localities, from temperate
   to subtropical waters, within Japan. I used common-environment
   experiments at three different temperatures to compare reproductive
   capacity among local populations. In the experiments, average
   inter-spawning intervals were the shortest and average size-specific
   clutch weight was the heaviest in fish from the most northern locality
   across all temperatures, showing clear latitudinal clines. Thus, the
   northern fish can achieve higher reproductive output per unit time both
   by shortening inter-spawning intervals and increasing size-specific
   clutch weight. Additionally, faster egg production rate of the northern
   fish did not result from increased food consumption. This finding
   suggests that gross egg production efficiency was higher in the northern
   fish and that northern fish had a superior capacity for reproduction
   within a season. These results support the prediction that latitudinal
   compensation occurs in the female reproductive rate of P. coelestis. As
   the reproductive season of this species decreases drastically with
   increasing latitude, the observed cline in the reproductive rate must be
   an adaptive response to the local selective regime, i.e., length of the
   reproductive season. Such latitudinal compensation in female
   reproductive rates may be a common pattern in latitudinally widespread
   fishes.

AB Drosophila suzukii is a major concern worldwide since its first
   detection in the Western world in 2008 because it is able to attack
   healthy ripening fruits producing high economic losses. The knowledge of
   its biological traits is fundamental to establish sustainable pest
   management strategies. One of the main factors determining population
   dynamics of arthropods is temperature. Therefore, modelling the response
   of the development of pests to this factor contributes to anticipate
   risk situations and to establish possible new areas of colonization. A
   mortality model and thirty-two developmental models were used to
   describe the relationship between the immature survival and
   developmental rate of D. suzukii versus temperature. The survival and
   developmental times of the immature stages were determined across a
   broad range of temperatures (10-31 degrees C). Then, the models were
   fitted and the predictions of the developmental models compared with the
   developmental times obtained under three regimes of fluctuating
   temperatures (4-16, 13-25 and 21-32 degrees C). Developmental models
   were applied to the complete range of temperatures studied at each
   regime, or they were truncated for the lower and upper regimes at the
   temperatures that produced 100% immature mortality estimated with the
   mortality model (8.7-30.9 degrees C). Better predictions were obtained
   with the non-truncated models, indicating that some development occurred
   under short exposures to temperatures beyond those producing 100%
   mortality during immature development. The Regniere, Lactin II, Hansen,
   Lobry-Rosso-Flandrois and Logan III models produced the lowest
   deviations and provided the most realistic lower and higher development
   thresholds.

AB We address the question of identifying the relative importance of
   covariates for model response, a form of sensitivity analysis. Relative
   importance is typically implemented as part of the model building
   procedure, e.g., forward variable selection or backward elimination.
   Here, we take a different perspective. We assume a model with multiple
   covariates and multivariate response has been selected and formulate
   criteria to assess covariate importance. Hence, with regard to
   covariates, our approach is joint, post model fitting, rather than
   conditional or sequential model creation. The noteworthy challenge we
   accommodate is the handling of multivariate response where individual
   regressions may give differing, perhaps conflicting, relative
   importances. In addition, we recognize that, according to the model
   specification, importance/sensitivity to covariates may be a global or a
   local issue. For models with multivariate response, we provide a
   criterion that (i) produces one sensitivity coefficient for each
   covariate, (ii) takes into account the model specification of
   uncertainty, and (iii) is based only on the model parameters but does
   not require a distribution on the covariates. However, with a prior on
   the covariates, in special cases, we show that comparison of covariates
   using this criterion gives the same results as comparison of marginal
   variances of the inverse predictive distributions of the covariates. We
   illustrate with an application examining sensitivity of tree abundance
   to climate.

   years. The newbom of the former species appeared in April each year. The
   latter species produced two cohorts per year until 2003. Spawning in
   spring led to the birth of the early cohort, which generally appeared in
   May, while spawning in the summer led to the birth of the late cohort,
   which appeared from July to November. The increase of the mean annual
   temperature by 1.9 degrees C from 1998 to 2000 was followed by an
   increase in the density of mollusc populations, possibly triggering or
   amplifying inter and intra specific competition for food. However. the
   2003 heatwave was responsible for the sudden decline of the P. amnicum
   population, then the more progressive decline of that of V. piscinalis
   after having strongly modified its demographic structure and its life
   cycle. In 2004 and 2005 V piscinalis only produced one cohort per year.
   The observations carried out strongly suggest that the insufficiency of
   available resources was one of the possible causes of their failure to
   recover in 2004 and 2005. The increase of global warming predicted by
   different models could result in the gradual disappearance of P. amnicum
   from the potamon and of V. piscinalis from the freshwater systems most
   directly exposed to climatic warming. such as the Saone River.

AB The distribution of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) during their

   has historically been associated with spring warming along the

   National Marine Fisheries Service spring surveys were compared with
   variations in sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite remote
   sensing for the eastern US continental shelf for the period 1985-1999.
   The mackerel stock was first analysed as a unit, then separated into
   three size classes to assess differences in distribution among years and
   individuals of various lengths. Results showed an across-shelf
   correlation between catch and March SST in the Mid-Atlantic Bight for
   both the entire population and each size class. Along-shelf catch
   variations were correlated with SST for large mackerel, but not total
   stock or smaller size classes. Finally, the distribution of mackerel
   length in the Gulf of Maine was negatively correlated with March SST in
   the Great South Channel. Results suggest surface temperature along the
   northeast continental shelf may be used to predict certain, but not all,
   aspects of annual migration along the shelf, and that factors in
   addition to temperature are also important in controlling distributions
   of Atlantic mackerel.

   Location Global.
   Methods The study is based on literature review.
   Results The number of vertebrae varies very widely across the diversity
   of fishes. Jordan's rule states that vertebral number increases with
   latitude, and this is widely attributed to ambient temperatures during
   ontogeny of individual fishes. However, the number of vertebrae may
   depend on both the ontogenetic environment and inheritance. Diverse
   other aspects of fish development and ecology are suggested as
   influencing vertebral number, including fish size, phyletic position,
   body shape and swimming mode.
   Main conclusions The number of different factors that influence the
   number of vertebrae in fishes makes for highly complex patterns of
   variation, and means that unravelling causes is difficult. The question
   needs to be addressed at the population/species/species group scale;
   moreover, the lack of discrimination between environmental and inherited
   causes of variation adds to the complexity.

AB Of the few studies that have examined in situ coral growth responses to
   recent climate change, none have done so in equatorial waters subject to
   relatively high sea temperatures (annual mean > 27A degrees C). This
   study compared the growth rate of Porites lutea from eight sites at
   Phuket, South Thailand between two time periods (December 1984-November
   1986 and December 2003-November 2005). There was a significant decrease
   in coral calcification (23.5%) and linear extension rates (19.4-23.4%)
   between the two sampling periods at a number of sites, while skeletal
   bulk density remained unchanged. Over the last 46 years, sea
   temperatures (SST) in the area have risen at a rate of 0.161A degrees C
   per decade (current seasonal temperature range 28-30A degrees C) and
   regression analysis of coral growth data is consistent with a link
   between rising temperature and reduced linear extension in the order of
   46-56% for every 1A degrees C rise in SST. The apparent sensitivity of
   linear extension in P. lutea to increased SST suggests that corals in
   this part of the Andaman Sea may already be subjected to temperatures
   beyond their thermal optimum for skeletal growth.

   fecundity, distribution and conservation status of the burbot Lota lota
   (Linnaeus, 1758) in Bulgaria. During six consecutive winters (2008-2014)
   a total of 395 burbot specimens were caught. The total length and the
   weight of the specimens ranged from 16 to 51 cm and 29.8 to 1057 g,
   respectively. Seven age classes were represented (3- to 9-years-old),
   with 3-, 4-, and 5-years-old most abundant. The maximal life expectancy
   was estimated as 12 years. Male-female ratio was 1:1. Maturity happens
   at the age of four at the earliest, valid for both sexes. One-quarter of
   the fish, older than 5 years were determined as non-reproducing in the
   particular year. The absolute fecundity varied between 47 462 and 810
   236 eggs for females ranging from 5 to 7 years old and from 25.7 to 41.5
   cm in length. A dramatic decrease of burbot population was observed in
   the last two decades. Warming water temperatures of the Danube, together
   with fragmentation in its tributaries are considered as the major
   threats affecting the species. Therefore, the burbot in Bulgaria is
   classified as Endangered.

   Tumeodiaptomus diabolicus, it was considered for female individuals the
   total length, eggs number, and ratio between total length. The results
   revealed at species level that B. poppei was significantly different in
   comparison to another species in all of the three species. At
   populations level it was found differences in three species considered.
   The results revealed that the reproductive parameters are variable in
   function of the environmental conditions of the populations. The results
   denoted that the reproductive parameters are markedly influenced by
   environmental conditions, and it would be associated with ecological
   consequences such as populational structures and properties of
   zooplankton community ecology.

AB We develop an analytical theory to explain the experimentally observed
   morphological transitions of quasispherical giant vesicles induced by
   alternating electric fields. The model treats the inner and suspending
   media as lossy dielectrics, and the membrane as an impermeable flexible
   incompressible-fluid sheet. The vesicle shape is obtained by balancing
   electric, hydrodynamic, bending, and tension stresses exerted on the
   membrane. Our approach, which is based on force balance, also allows us
   to describe the time evolution of the vesicle deformation, in contrast
   to earlier works based on energy minimization, which are able to predict
   only stationary shapes. Our theoretical predictions for vesicle
   deformation are consistent with experiment. If the inner fluid is more
   conducting than the suspending medium, the vesicle always adopts a
   prolate shape. In the opposite case, the vesicle undergoes a transition
   from a prolate to oblate ellipsoid at a critical frequency, which the
   theory identifies with the inverse membrane charging time. At
   frequencies higher than the inverse Maxwell-Wagner polarization time,
   the electrohydrodynamic stresses become too small to alter the vesicle's
   quasispherical rest shape. The model can be used to rationalize the
   transient and steady deformation of biological cells in electric fields.

AB Actin polymerization provides a major driving force for eukaryotic cell
   motility. Successive intercalation of monomeric actin subunits between
   the plasma membrane and the filamentous actin network results in
   protrusions of the membrane enabling the cell to move or to change
   shape. One of the challenges in understanding eukaryotic cell motility
   is to dissect the elementary biochemical and biophysical steps that link
   actin polymerization to mechanical force generation. Recently,
   significant progress was made using biomimetic, in vitro systems that
   are inspired by the actin-based motility of bacterial pathogens such as
   Listeria monocytogenes. Polystyrene microspheres and synthetic
   phospholipid vesicles coated with proteins that initiate actin
   polymerization display motile behavior similar to Listeria, mimicking
   the leading edge of lamellipodia and filopodia. A major advantage of
   these biomimetic systems is that both biochemical and physical
   parameters can be controlled precisely. These systems provide a test bed
   for validating theoretical models on force generation and polarity
   establishment resulting from actin polymerization. In this review, we
   discuss recent experimental progress using biomimetic systems propelled
   by actin polymerization and discuss these results in the light of recent
   theoretical models on actin-based motility.

AB Numerous biological processes, including muscular contraction, depend
   upon the mechanical properties of actin filaments. One such property is
   resistance to bending (flexural rigidity, Fl). To estimate Fl, we
   attached the ends of fluorescently labelled actin filaments to two
   microsphere 'handles' captured in independent laser traps. The positions
   of the traps were manipulated to apply a range of tensions (0-8 pN) to
   the filaments via the microsphere handles. With increasing filament
   tension, the displacement of the microspheres tvas inconsistent with a
   microsphere-filament system that is rigid. We maintain that this
   inconsistency is due to the microspheres rotating in the trap and the
   filaments bending near their attachments to accommodate this rotation.
   Fitting the experimental data to a simple model of this phenomena, we
   estimate actin's Fl to be approximate to 15 x 10(3) pN nm(2), a value
   within the range of previously reported results, albeit using a novel
   method. These results both: support the idea that actin filaments are
   more compliant than historically assumed; and, indicate that without
   appropriately pretensioning the actin filament in similar laser traps,
   measurements of unitary molecular events (e.g. myosin displacement) may
   be significantly underestimated.

AB Life cycle of the mesopelagic copepod Pareuchaeta elongata was
   investigated combining laboratory rearing data on the eggs, nauplii, and
   early copepodites with field growth data on the late copepodites.
   Examination and incubation at near the in situ temperature (0.5 degrees
   C) of egg sacs collected from the field indicated that the clutch size
   was 13 to 24 eggs (mean: 20), hatching time was 39.4 d (mean), and
   hatchability was low (mean: 28.5%). The development time at 0.5 degrees
   C was 2.4 d for Nauplius Stage 1 (N1), 4.6 d for N2, 6.2 d for N3, 7.4 d
   for N4, 7.1 d for N5, 20.8 d for N6, 36.7 d for Copepodite Stage 1 (C1)
   and 65.3 d for C2. From the numerical analysis of seasonal samples
   collected from the field, the development time was estimated as 1 mo for
   C3, 2 mo for C4 and 2.5 mo for C5. Thus, the egg hatching time plus the
   integrated development time by stage was 355 d or nearly 1 yr (i.e. span
   of one life cycle). Duration of the C6 (adult) was estimated as > 2.5
   mo. Combining the present data on development times of each stage with
   published data on the major spawning season (August to October) and
   ontogenetic migration, a schematic representation of the life cycle of
   this copepod was developed. Between-stage comparison of wet, dry, and
   ash-free dry weights of all developmental stages of preserved wild
   specimens revealed that there is almost no gain in weight during
   naupliar stages, and the greatest weight increment over the life cycle
   was during the C4 stage. The present results are compared with those for
   the same and related species living in other regions.

   remain. Here, improved methods of identification use vertebra structure
   to distinguish salmon from trout, and strontium/calcium ratios to
   differentiate sea-run from landlocked salmon. In addition to the Little

   48.5 degreesC), whereas most guards cooled down. Our data suggest that

AB Attempts to understand body size as an adaptation to the deep sea have
   relied primarily on measuring and interpreting size-depth relationships.
   The numerous studies documenting bathymetric size trends during the last
   30 yr report widely divergent results. Body size has been found to
   significantly increase or decrease with depth in different taxa, but
   often shows no statistical pattern. Some of this variation is
   attributable to methodological inconsistencies and/or differences in how
   taxa or functional groups respond to environmental gradients associated
   with depth. Here, we show that the shape of the size-depth relationship
   also depends on the depth zone inhabited. We measured shell size for
   gastropods (81 species, 3423 individuals) collected in the western North
   Atlantic from depths of 200 to 5000 m. This database makes it possible
   to assess size within species and among taxa, and to document how body
   size changes across the continental margin and abyssal plain. Quantile
   regression shows that maximum size attained among all gastropods
   increases with depth in the bathyal zone, and then decreases in the
   abyss. This overall unimodal pattern appears to be generated partly by
   within-species clines. Size tends to increase with depth in species with
   upper-to mid-bathyal distributions, and to decrease with depth in
   species with lower-bathyal to abyssal distributions, independent of
   feeding type and mode of larval development. The shift from
   predominantly positive to negative specific size-depth clines at the
   bathyal-abyssal transition and the prevalence of smaller individuals in
   the abyss may reflect a fundamental change in ecological opportunity.

AB The North Atlantic with its spring-bloom ecosystem has its particular
   responses to climate change, many of them different from the other parts
   of the world's oceans. The system is strongly influenced by
   anthropogenic climate change as well as to strong decadal to
   multidecadal natural climate variability. In particular, the
   northernmost part of the system and the Arctic is exposed to higher
   increase in temperature than any other ocean region. The most pronounced
   examples of poleward migration of marine species are found in the North
   Atlantic, and comprise the recent warming phase after the 1970s. The
   latitudinal asymmetric position of the Arctic Front and its nature of
   change result in a considerably larger migration distance and migration
   speed of species in the Northeast Atlantic part of the system. However,
   we here hypothesize that there is a limit to the future extent of
   poleward migration of species constrained by the latitudinal region
   adjacent the Polar Circle. We define this region the critical latitudes.
   This is because the seasonal light cycle at high latitudes sets
   particular demands on the life cycle of planktivorous species.
   Presently, boreal planktivorous species at high latitudes deposit lipids
   during the short spring bloom period and overwinter when phytoplankton
   production is insufficient for feeding. Unless invading temperate
   species from farther south are able to adapt by developing a similar
   life cycle future poleward migration of such species will be unlikely.

AB Thermally variable environments are particularly challenging for
   ectotherms as physiological functions are thermo-dependent. As a
   consequence, ectotherms in highly seasonal environments are predicted to
   have greater thermal plasticity. However, much of our understanding of
   thermal plasticity comes from controlled experiments in a laboratory
   setting. Relatively fewer studies investigate thermal plasticity in
   free-ranging animals living in their natural environment. We
   investigated the presence of thermal plasticity within a single activity
   season in adult males of a natural high elevation population of White's
   skink (Liopholis whitii) in south-eastern Australia. This species lives
   in a permanent home site (rock crevice and/or burrow), facilitating the
   repeated capture of the same individuals across the activity season. We
   monitored the thermal variation across the field site and over the
   activity season, and tested thermal tolerances and performance of male
   L. whitii on three occasions across their activity season. Maximum and
   average temperatures varied across the field site, and temperatures
   gradually increased across the study period. Evidence of temporal
   plasticity was identified in the critical thermal minimum and thermal
   tolerance breadth, but not in the critical thermal maximum. Thermal
   performance was also found to be plastic, but no temporal patterns were
   evident. Our temporal plasticity results are consistent which much of
   the previous literature, but this is one of the first studies to
   identify these patterns in a free-ranging population. In addition, our
   results indicate that performance may be more plastic than previous
   literature suggests. Overall, our study highlights the need to pair
   laboratory and field studies in order to understand thermal plasticity
   in an ecologically relevant context.

AB Active dynamic processes of cells are largely driven by the
   cytoskeleton, a complex and adaptable semiflexible polymer network,
   motorized by mechanoenzymes. Small dimensions, confined geometries, and
   hierarchical structures make it challenging to probe dynamics and
   mechanical response of such networks. Embedded semiflexible probe
   polymers can serve as nonperturbing multiscale probes to detect force
   distributions in active polymer networks. We show here that
   motor-induced forces transmitted to the probe polymers are reflected in
   nonequilibrium bending dynamics, which we analyze in terms of spatial
   eigenmodes of an elastic beam under steady-state conditions. We
   demonstrate how these active forces induce correlations among the mode
   amplitudes, which furthermore break time-reversal symmetry. This leads

AB Environmental variability in aquatic ecosystems makes the study of
   ectotherms complex and challenging. Physiologists have historically
   overcome this hurdle in the laboratory by using 'average' conditions,
   representative of the natural environment for any given animal.
   Temperature, in particular, has widespread impact on the physiology of
   animals, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand these
   effects as we face future climate challenges. The majority of research
   to date has focused on the expected global average increase in
   temperature; however, increases in climate variability are predicted to
   affect animals as much or more than climate warming. Physiological
   responses associated with the acclimation to a new stable temperature
   are distinct from those in thermally variable environments. Our goal is
   to highlight these physiological differences as they relate to both
   thermal acclimation and the 'fallacy of the average' or Jensen's
   inequality using theoretical models and novel empirical data. We
   encourage the use of more realistic thermal environments in experimental
   design to advance our understanding of these physiological responses
   such that we can better predict how aquatic animals will respond to
   future changes in our climate.

   of confinement on cytoskeletal filaments we study the thermal
   fluctuations of individual actin filaments in a microfluidic in vitro
   system by fluorescence microscopy and determine the persistence length
   of the filaments by analyzing the radial distribution function. A unique
   feature of this method is that we obtain the persistence length without
   detailed knowledge of the complete contour of the filament which makes
   the technique applicable to a broad range of biological polymers,

AB Many physiological processes of domestic animals exhibit daily
   rhythmicity. The goal of the present study was to investigate, in cows,
   the influence of different schedules of feeding on daily rhythms of
   blood urea and ammonia concentrations. Fifteen Italian Brown cows, from
   the same farm, clinically healthy and placed at the same environmental
   temperature and photoperiod, were used for this study. Thirty days
   before the experiment, all the subjects were divided into three
   homogeneous groups of five cows: A group was fed at 08.00, B group was
   fed at 16.00, both having access to food for two hours (A group
   08.00-10.00; B group 16.00-18.00) and C group was fed ad libitum. Blood
   samples were collected at four hour intervals for 72 consecutive hours
   starting at 08.00 of the first day and finishing at 04.00 of the third
   day via intravenous cannula inserted into the jugular vein. On each
   serum, blood urea and ammonia concentrations were assayed. Data analysis
   was conducted by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   and by the single cosinor method. ANOVA showed a significant effect of
   time on all parameters studied, in either day, with P < 0.0002 for
   ammonia in A group and P < 0.0001 for ammonia and P < 0.0005 for urea in
   B group. Cosinor analysis identified the periodic parameters and their
   acrophases (expressed in hours) during the three days of monitoring:
   urea showed nocturnal acrophases in B group, ammonia showed diurnal
   acrophases both in A and B groups. Our results suggest the influence of
   external stimuli, such as feeding time, on the rhythmic pattern of the
   metabolites involved in liver function and the hypothetic interaction
   between circadian clocks placed in the liver and the mean circadian
   system.

AB The increasing trend in jellyfish blooms that have been observed in some
   coastal areas around the world can have serious ecological consequences.
   In particular, the fate of jellyfish organic matter (jelly-OM), after
   the decay of jellyfish blooms, and their implications for marine
   biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning, are still unclear. In
   order to study bacteria-jelly-OM interactions and the associated fate of
   the jelly-OM, we conducted two sets of short-term jelly-OM enrichment
   experiments using coastal and offshore ambient pelagic bacterial
   assemblages from the Black Sea, where the scyphozoan medusa Aurelia
   aurita blooms seasonally. The microbial transformation of the jelly-OM
   was followed using a stable delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses of
   particulate jelly-OM together with standard organic and inorganic matter
   chemical analyses. The effect of the jelly-OM on the ambient bacterial
   community was investigated by following changes in bacterial abundance,
   growth rates, and community structure. The Black Sea's surface bacterial
   assemblages from both systems, coastal and offshore, responded rapidly
   to the jelly-OM enrichment, preferentially utilizing nitrogen-rich
   constituents of the jelly-OM, leaving carbon enriched particulate OM
   (hypothetically recalcitrant) in the system. The end products of the
   bacteria-mediated jelly-OM degradation process, i.e. total dissolved
   nitrogen and ammonium, accumulated in the system, indicating possible
   implications for the nitrogen cycle. Despite the differences in the
   Black Sea's coastal and offshore seawater background nutrient
   concentrations and particulate OM quality, the nitrogen budget was very
   much the same in both studied systems, however there were differences in
   the bacterial community function/performance from these two
   environments. The addition of jelly-OM triggered different structural
   changes in the coastal and offshore ambient bacterial communities,
   suggesting that different bacterial groups were capable of utilizing
   jelly-OM. A comparison of the response of natural bacterial community to
   the jelly-OM and the bacterial transformation of the jelly-OM in
   different marine ecosystems indicates that the degree of bacterial
   growth rate and the rate of ammonium accumulation depend on the
   incidence of jellyfish occurrence, physiochemical environmental
   conditions, and possibly also on ambient bacterial community
   composition. Our study provides insights into the nature of
   bacteria-jelly-OM interactions, the processes and mechanisms of
   bacterial jelly-OM transformation, and the consequences for marine
   nitrogen (and carbon) cycle, as well as for the functioning of different
   coastal marine ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twelve hybrids obtained by crossing of different Hungarian cultivars and
   the Spanish 'Jaranda', 'Jariza' and 'Jeromin' have been studied. The aim
   of this work was to select those peppers with high capsaicinoids
   content, and good agronomic and industrial characteristics, as
   'Jeromin', the only local cultivar used for pungent ( hot) paprika, has
   a low and irregular pungency depending on the year. The crop productive
   characteristics, ASTA colour, carotenoid pigment content and pungency of
   the paprika has been studied and elaborated following the traditional
   procedure of La Vera ( Extremadura, Spain). The productive
   characteristics and pigment concentration of the crossings were, in
   general, similar to that of local cultivars, and all of them could be
   suitable for hot paprika production, because their capsaicinoid content
   was higher than that of 'Jeromin' (78 mg kg(-1) dwt of total
   capsaicinoids). The most pungent hybrids were Kibedicsipos x Jariza,
   Jeromin x Szegedi178 and Jaranda x Szegedi179, with a total capsaicinoid
   content of 1,240, 1,107, and 997 mg kg(-1) dwt, respectively. Their
   paprikas showed a carotenoid pigment content higher than that of
   'Jaranda', which is considered as a high quality paprika.

AB Multiple forces structure natural microbial communities, but the
   relative roles and interactions of these drivers are poorly understood.
   Gradients of physical and chemical parameters can be especially
   influential. In traditional ecological theory, variability in
   environmental conditions across space and time represents habitat
   heterogeneity, which may shape communities. Here we used aquatic
   microbial communities as a model to investigate the relationship between
   habitat heterogeneity and community composition and dynamics. We defined
   spatial habitat heterogeneity as vertical temperature and dissolved
   oxygen (DO) gradients in the water column, and temporal habitat
   heterogeneity as variation throughout the open-water season in these
   environmental parameters. Seasonal lake mixing events contribute to
   temporal habitat heterogeneity by destroying and re-creating these
   gradients. Because of this, we selected three lakes along a range of
   annual mixing frequency (polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) for our
   study. We found that bacterial community composition (BCC) was distinct
   between the epilimnion and hypolimnion within stratified lakes, and also
   more variable within the epilimnia through time. We found stark
   differences in patterns of epilimnion and hypolimnion dynamics over time
   and across lakes, suggesting that specific drivers have distinct
   relative importance for each community.

   DAH), caudal-, dorsal-, and anal- fin rays ( by 60 DAH), pectoral-fin
   rays ( between 60 DAH and 100 DAH), and pelvic-fin rays ( by 100 DAH).
   Both morphological characters and meristic counts indicate that this

AB Background and Aims in many flammable ecosystems, physically dormant
   seeds show dormancy-break patterns tied to tire, but the link between
   heat shock and germination in the tropical savannas of Africa and South
   America remains controversial. Seed heat tolerance is important,
   preventing seed mortality during fire passage, and is usually predicted
   by seed traits. This study investigated the role of fire frequency
   (ecological effects) and seed traits through phylogenetic comparison
   (historical effects), in determining post-fire germination and seed
   mortality in legume species of the Cerrado, a tropical savanna forest
   mosaic.
   Methods Seeds of 46 legume species were collected from three vegetation
   types (grassy savannas, woody savannas and forests) with different fire
   frequencies. Heat shock experiments (100 C for 1 min, 100 degrees C for
   3 min, 200 C for 1 min) were then performed, followed by germination and
   seed viability tests. Principal component analysis, generalized linear
   mixed models and phylogenetic comparisons were used in data analyses.
   Key Results Heat shocks had little effect on germination, but seed
   mortality was variable across treatments and species. Seed mortality was
   lowest under the 100 degrees C 1 min treatment, and significantly higher
   under 100 degrees C 3 min and 200 degrees C 1 min; larger seed mass
   decreased seed mortality, especially at 200 C. Tree species in
   Detarioideae had the largest seeds and were unaffected by heat. Small
   seededspecies (mostly shrubs from grassy savannas) were relatively
   sensitive to the hottest treatment. Nevertheless, the presence of
   physical dormancy helped to avoid seed mortality in small-seeded species
   under the hottest treatment.
   Conclusions Physical dormancy-break is not tied to fire in the Cerrado
   mosaic. Heat tolerance appears in both forest and savanna species and is
   predicted by seed traits (seed mass and physical dormancy), which might
   have helped forest lineages to colonize the savannas. The results show
   seed fire responses are better explained by historical than ecological
   factors in the Cerrado, contrasting with different fire-prone ecosystems
   throughout the world.

   sampling episodes lasting 34-61.5 h, dissolved Mn and Zn concentrations
   increased from afternoon minimum values to maximum values shortly after
   sunrise. Dissolved As concentrations exhibited the inverse timing. The
   magnitude of diel concentration increases varied in the range 17-152%
   for Mn and 70-500% for Zn. Diel increases of As concentrations (17-55%)
   were less variable. The timing of minimum and maximum values of diel
   streamflow cycles was inconsistent among sampling episodes and had
   little relation to the timing of metal concentration cycles, suggesting
   that geochemical rather than hydrological processes are the primary

AB The octopus fishery on the Campeche Bank (Yucatan, Mexico) is considered
   the third largest in the world. In Yucatan, two fleets target this
   resource: an artisanal fleet and a semi-industrial fleet. The artisanal
   fleet only catches Octopus maya, while the semi-industrial fleet catches
   two species, O. maya and O. "vulgaris" Type II, because it operates at
   deeper waters (>30 m). Since there is no information on the abundance of
   O. "vidgaris" Type II, management is based only on O. maya. In order to
   generate information about the abundance of this species, four fishing
   research cruises were carried out in the northeastern area of the
   continental shelf off the Yucatan Peninsula. Four methods (a stratified
   random method, a swept area, geostatistics and a weighted swept area)
   were applied and compared to determine the instantaneous abundance and
   biomass of both species in the study area. The lowest potential biomass
   was calculated with the geostatistical method, with values between 18.5%
   and 36.7% lower than the other three methods. O. "vulgaris" Type 11
   showed the lowest biomass (37.8 +/- 3.36 t) during May and July and the
   highest (189.56 +/- 11.6 t) in December. Our findings revealed that the
   total abundance of both species was similar in the study area, with a
   geographic overlap whose amplitude changed throughout the year according
   to the geographic position: O. maya dominated at approximately 88
   degrees W, while O. "vulgaris" Type 11 dominated towards the southeast
   at 87 degrees W.

AB Behavioral thermoregulation can allow ectotherms to buffer the effects
   of changes in environmental temperature, and thus an organism's
   preferred temperature is thought to be under strong selection. However,
   this contention has seldom been tested. We used common killifish
   Fundulus heteroclitus from high-latitude (northern) and low-latitude
   (southern) populations to investigate intraspecific variation in thermal
   preference and its relationship to habitat temperature. We quantified
   the preferred temperatures of northern and southern killifish
   populations acclimated to three temperatures (5 degrees, 15 degrees, and
   25 degrees C) to evaluate two alternative hypotheses for the evolution
   of differences in thermal preference among latitudinally separated
   populations: local thermal adaptation, which predicts that organisms
   from high latitudes should prefer lower temperatures than individuals
   from lower latitudes, versus countergradient variation, which predicts
   that high-latitude organisms should prefer higher temperatures to
   compensate for shorter growing seasons. All killifish selected their
   final thermal preferendum within 4 h. Southern killifish and killifish
   acclimated to warmer temperatures had greater variability in selected
   temperature. This increase in variability was the result of an increase
   in interindividual variation in preferred temperature rather than a
   reduction in the precision of temperature selection in these groups.
   Northern killifish preferred significantly higher temperatures than
   southern fish (30.6 degrees vs. 29.0 degrees C, respectively, when
   calculated on the basis of the temperature selected consistently for at

   countergradient variation in thermal preference in killifish.

AB In the terrestrial crustacean At madillidium vulgare the prolonged
   presence of males along with females is known to boost female
   reproductive physiology, and the so-called 'male-effect' was best
   characterized by a significant shortening of the pre-parturial
   intermoult (PPI) during which oocyte maturation spontaneously takes
   place Continuous presence of a male over that period can speed up both
   the vitellogenesis and the moulting cycle, so to reduce female PPI by
   15-20 days (shortening of 30-40%, in comparison to females reared with
   other females or in isolation respectively) In the last investigation on
   the subject we revealed that sexual interactions may start much sooner
   than previously thought in this species, and suggested that the observed
   male effect may likely result from early mating stimulations Here we
   tested the specific effect of controlled mating interactions (one or two
   mating events at different times) on female PPI We revealed that male
   presence for the time that allowed a single mating to occur (about 2 h)
   was enough to reduce the female intermoult by about 10 days (shortening
   of 19% in comparison to females reared in similar conditions but in the
   absence of mating interaction) Moreover, results indicate that the
   earlier and longer the copulations the stronger the 'male-effect'
   Altogether, the data support the conclusion that A vulgare females are
   able to adjust their reproductive physiology according to the
   presence/absence and the intensity of male mating stimuli We place the
   findings in a broader ecological context, revise the so far prevailing
   view on the 'male-effect', and stress on its possible significance in
   relation to the occurrence of feminising bacteria in this and other
   terrestrial isopod species

AB The climatological means and surface air temperature (SAT) trends of the
   Indochina Peninsula (ICP) are being analyzed on a yearly and seasonal
   basis using a newly published observation dataset (SA-OBS). The SAT for
   the period 1981 to 2010 shows a north-south gradient over the ICP, with
   the highest mean annual temperature in the central plain and the lowest
   in the northern mountain region. In addition, over the past 30years, the
   ICP has been undergoing a significant warming trend of 0.37 degrees
   C/decade. The seasonal mean SAT fluctuations are significant in the dry
   seasons compared to the wet seasons, with a rapid increase in JFM
   (January to March) and OND (October to December). Further, comparisons
   are made using SA-OBS and the other observation (CRU, GHCN_CAMS, DEL) or
   reanalysis (ERA-20C, CERA-20C, ERA-Interim, JRA-55) datasets. The result
   shows (i) that the SA-OBS dataset can capture the spatial distributions
   and temporal patterns reasonably well throughout the ICP on annual and
   seasonal scales. (ii) CERA-20C is very similar to SA-OBS in replicating
   the annual mean SAT over the ICP, suggesting that the ECMWF's coupled
   data assimilation system (CERA) could obviously improve the temperature
   estimates in that region. (iii) That significant differences, however,
   still exist between observations and reanalyses in annual and seasonal
   trends. These discrepancies need to be taken into account to study
   climate change and variability or to assess regional climate models with
   focus on the ICP.

AB Urbanization causes both changes in community composition and
   evolutionary responses, but most studies focus on these responses in
   isolation. We performed an integrated analysis assessing the relative
   contribution of intra-and interspecific trait turnover to the observed
   change in zooplankton community body size in 83 cladoceran communities
   along urbanization gradients quantified at seven spatial scales (50-3200
   m radii). We also performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 12
   Daphnia magna populations along the same urbanization gradient. Body
   size in zooplankton communities generally declined with increasing
   urbanization, but the opposite was observed for communities dominated by
   large species. The contribution of intraspecific trait variation to
   community body size turnover with urbanization strongly varied with the
   spatial scale considered, and was highest for communities dominated by
   large cladoceran species and at intermediate spatial scales. Genotypic
   size at maturity was smaller for urban than for rural D. magna
   populations and for animals cultured at 24 degrees C compared with 20
   degrees C. While local genetic adaptation likely contributed to the
   persistence of D. magna in the urban heat islands, buffering for the
   phenotypic shift to larger body sizes with increasing urbanization,
   community body size turnover was mainly driven by non-genetic
   intraspecific trait change.

AB Spectral analysis of twenty-one climate records indicates that NE
   Pacific temperatures and winter wind stress have fluctuated at four
   dominant: time scales in this century: 2-3 years (quasi-biennial
   oscillation), 5-7 years (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, ENSO), 20-25
   years (bidecadal oscillation, BDO), and a poorly resolved,
   very-low-frequency (VLF) oscillation with a 50-75 year period.
   Forty-four per cent of the low-frequency variability in British Columbia
   air temperatures is associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low
   pressure system in winter. Only 42% of the 'strong' and 25% of the
   'moderate' ENSO events in this century have produced large warm
   anomalies off BC. Interactions between the ENSO, bidecadal and
   very-low-frequency oscillations produce a pattern of alternating warm
   and cool climate states, with major warmings every 50 to 75 years. Since
   1850 there have been seven warm periods, lasting an average of 11.4
   years, and six cool periods lasting an average of 10.8 years. Sharp
   transitions from cool to warm climate states (as in 1977/78) occur when
   warming phases of the BDO and VLF oscillations coincide. Recent evidence
   suggests that the BDO may originate in either the tropical or the
   subtropical North Pacific. The NE Pacific has experienced a major
   warming since 1978. A long-range forecast suggests that: the BDO and VLF
   oscillations peaked in 1989 and are currently in a cooling phase.
   Consequently, coastal temperatures should moderate for the rest of this
   century. A transition to the next cool climate state could occur about
   the year 2001. The forecast: for moderating temperatures could begin the
   first phase of the recovery of the southern BC coastal chinook and coho
   salmon and herring stocks, which are currently at low abundance levels.

AB The capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea plays a key role in
   the Arctic food web. The large fluctuations in the biomass of the
   Barents Sea capelin have been poorly understood and collapses in the
   biomass have occurred. A system analysis of the capelin stock has
   identified a state differential equation model and a frequency transfer
   function model of the stock properties. The results of this research
   show that the capelin stock dynamics is adapted to the 18.6 year and the
   18.6/3 = 6.2 year lunar nodal tide that influences the temperature in
   the Barents Sea. An analysis of the capelin time series has identified a
   6.2 yr cycle of recruitment, maturity and fish stock growth. An
   estimated frequency response of a stock-number, life-cycle model has
   identified a stochastic resonance of about half of the 6.2 yr cycle. The
   stochastic resonance shows that fluctuation of the stock number is a
   natural adaptation to the environment and a strategy for optimal growth
   and survival in the long run. In this stochastic resonance timing
   between the stock number fluctuation and the 6.2 yr cycle is most
   important. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the

AB Subsurface soil CO2 concentration is an important component of the
   terrestrial C budget and site specific information on the spatial and
   temporal variability and how it responds to forest management is needed
   for accurately estimating ecosystem C budgets. The objectives of this
   study were to examine the within site spatial and seasonal variability,
   and differences between sites of subsurface CO2 concentrations as
   affected by microtopography, clear cut harvesting, and soil texture. To
   address these objectives, we used two paired forested and clear cut
   sites of contrasting soil texture in Nova Scotia, Canada. The soil
   texture at the Lakevale pair (LF=intact forest and LCC=clear cut) was
   sandy while that of Pomquet (PF: intact forest and PCC=clear cut) was
   clayey. Two and half-years after clear cut harvesting, data were
   collected from each site on an approximately monthly time interval for 1
   year from four mineral soil depths (0, 5, 20 and 35 cm) and 10
   microsites separated by approximately 10 m and representing three local
   topographic features (level, trough and hump). We also monitored soil
   temperature and moisture with depth at a representative location at each
   site. Soil CO2 showed high within site variability and ranged between
   346 and 28,086 ppmv (median=2835) for LF, 319-29,135 (median=2802) for
   LCC, 364-29,016 (median=2345) for PF, and 407-81,053 (median=5690) for
   PCC. Differences due to microtopographic positions were not
   statistically significant (p>0.05). Median CO2 concentration and its
   variability generally increased with depth. Seasonally aggregated data
   indicated a distinct pattern with median CO2 concentrations as high as
   8646 ppmv (95% confidence interval=6937-12,142) during summer at PCC and
   as low as 1570 ppmv (95% confidence interval=1290-1920) at LCC during
   winter. Despite the high within site variability, PCC showed
   significantly higher median CO2 concentration than PE No significant
   difference in subsurface CO2 concentration was found between LF and LCC.
   Subsurface CO2 concentration showed significant quadratic correlation
   (R-2=0.32-0.85, p<0.05) with soil temperature and volumetric water
   content only for the Lakevale sites, suggesting the presence of strong
   soil texture control on subsurface CO2 concentration dynamics at these
   sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Question
   Does vegetation buffer or amplify rainfall perturbations, and is it
   possible to forecast rainfall using mesoscale climatic signals?
   Location
   Central California (USA).
   Methods
   The risk of dry or wet rainfall events was evaluated using conditional
   probabilities of rainfall depending on El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) events. The propagation of rainfall perturbations on vegetation
   was calculated using cross-correlations between monthly seasonally
   adjusted (SA) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and SA antecedent
   rainfall at different time-scales.
   Results
   In this region, El Nino events are associated with higher than normal
   winter precipitation (probability of 73%). Opposite but more predictable
   effects are found for La Nina events (89% probability of dry events).
   Chaparral and evergreen forests showed the longest persistence of
   rainfall effects (0-8 months). Grasslands and wetlands showed low
   persistence (0-2 months), with wetlands dominated by non-stationary
   patterns. Within the region, the NDVI spatial patterns associated with
   higher (lower) rainfall are homogeneous (heterogeneous), with the
   exception of evergreen forests.
   Conclusions
   Knowledge of the time-scale of lagged effects of the non-seasonal
   component of rainfall on vegetation greenness, and the risk of winter
   rainfall anomalies lays the foundation for developing a forecasting
   model for vegetation greenness. Our results also suggest greater
   competitive advantage for perennial vegetation in response to potential
   rainfall increases in the region associated with climate change
   predictions, provided that the soil allows storing extra rainfall.

   decadal variability as well as the overall trend (1.8 degrees C/69
   years) in the homogenized data is comparable to other homogenized Swiss
   time series at other altitudes. A detailed analysis of seasonal mean
   temperature trends revealed no significant height dependence for the
   period 1961-2005. The dominant trend features are the weaker trends in
   autumn, significant only at low altitudes. Temperature indices such as
   thawing days, derived from newly homogenized minimum temperature series,
   exhibit strong vertical and seasonal trend dependence. Strongest
   relative trends occur in winter at an altitude around 1000 and 1600 in
   asl. For the summer season relative trends in thawing days are strongest
   at the highest stations, as expected. At Jungfraujoch an increase of
   about 50% is observed for the period 1961-2005 even when the
   extraordinary warm summer of 2003 is excluded. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change is affecting plant phenology worldwide. Phenological
   responses vary among species, but it is not clear how responses differ
   among closely related species. We examined a 25-yr record (1981-2005) of
   flowering times for 97 trees, representing 17 species and hybrids of
   cherry (Cerasus sp. or Prunus sp.) grown at Mt. Takao, in Tokyo, Japan.
   The cherry trees flowered earlier over time, by an average of 5.5 d over
   the 25-yr study. Earlier flowering was explained largely by a 1.8
   degrees C increase in February-March mean monthly temperatures. Most
   species and hybrids flowered 3-5 d earlier for each 1 degrees C increase
   in temperature, but early-flowering taxa flowered as much as 9 d earlier
   for each VC increase in temperature. Flowering durations and differences
   in flowering times among species were greater in warm years than in cold
   years. Species and individual trees also flowered longer in warm years.
   These results show that the flowering times of closely related species
   may change similarly in response to climate change, but that
   early-flowering species may diverge from the overall trend in a
   predictable way. Such changes in flowering may affect gene flow and
   pollination as the length of the flowering season increases.

AB Tree-ring width of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr., ratios of stable
   isotopes of C (delta C-13) and O (delta O-18) of whole wood and
   cellulose chronologies were obtained for the northern part of central
   Siberia (Tura, Russia) for the period 1864-2006. A strong decrease in
   the isotope ratios of O and C (after atmospheric delta C-13 corrections)
   and tree-ring width was observed for the period 1967-2005, while weather
   station data show a decrease in July precipitation, along with
   increasing July air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
   Temperature at the end of May and the whole month of June mainly
   determines tree radial growth and marks the beginning of the vegetation
   period in this region. A positive correlation between tree-ring width
   and July precipitation was found for the calibration period 1929-2005.
   Positive significant correlations between C isotope chronologies and
   temperatures of June and July were found for whole wood and cellulose
   and negative relationships with July precipitation. These relationships
   are strengthened when the likely physiological response of trees to
   increased CO2 is taken into account (by applying a recently developed
   delta C-13 correction). For the O isotope ratios, positive relationships
   with annual temperature, VPD of July and a negative correlation with
   annual precipitation were observed. The delta O-18 in tree rings may
   reflect annual rather than summer temperatures, due to the late melting
   of the winter snow and its contribution to the tree water supply in
   summer. We observed a clear change in the isotope and climate trends
   after the 1960s, resulting in a drastic change in the relationship
   between C and O isotope ratios from a negative to a positive
   correlation. According to isotope fractionation models, this indicates
   reduced stomatal conductance at a relatively constant photosynthetic
   rate, as a response of trees to water deficit for the last half century
   in this permafrost region.

AB Understanding precipitation-vegetation interaction is of great
   importance to implementing adaptation and mitigation measures for
   terrestrial ecosystems. Many studies have explored the spatial pattern
   of precipitation-vegetation correlation along the precipitation amount
   gradient. While the impacts of other precipitation characteristics
   remain poorly understood. Here, we provided a comprehensive
   investigation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation response to
   precipitation anomalies in China, using satellite-derived vegetation
   index and multi-source climate datasets for the years 1982-2015.
   Subsequently, we attempted to examine in detail what specific factors,
   climatic or biogeographic, are responsible for spatiotemporal patterns
   of precipitation-vegetation relationship. Results show that vegetation
   in Inner Mongolia Plateau is strongly affected by precipitation
   anomalies. Vegetation has a 1-2 month lag response to precipitation
   anomalies and is significantly correlated with 2-6 month cumulative
   precipitation anomalies. Seasonal differences of vegetation response are
   also remarkable. Moreover, the largest NDVI-precipitation correlation
   appears in areas with 150-500 mm of mean annual precipitation,
   0.075-0.275 of fraction of precipitation days, and 19-23 of
   precipitation concentration index. More locally, the spatial
   distribution of NDVI-precipitation correlations is closely related to
   the vegetation type and elevation. The results can provide technical
   basis and beneficial reference to water resource and ecological
   management strategies in China for associated policymakers and
   stakeholders.

AB The impacts of global warming on aquatic ecosystems are expected to be
   most pronounced at higher trophic levels in cold-water environments.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that warming of fishless alpine ponds would
   suppress large-bodied consumers (e.g., cladocerans, copepods) and
   stimulate fast-growing microorganisms (e.g., phytoflagellates,
   rotifers), thereby altering the community composition and total
   abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton. This hypothesis was tested
   using three blocks of four experimental mesocosms (1000-liter capacity)
   that were located next to alpine ponds in Banff National Park, Canada.
   Each block received unfiltered pond water and sediment from a pond
   following ice out in June 2000. A warming treatment (control vs.
   3.6degreesC warmed) was achieved by controlling the ventilation of
   greenhouse canopies that were suspended over each of the mesocosms. By
   the end of our 50-d experiment, warming significantly suppressed total
   zooplankton biomass because large cladocerans (Daphnia pulex) declined
   while rotifer (Keratella cochlearis, Conochilus unicornis) abundance
   increased during the second half of the experiment. In contrast, warming
   did not affect total phytoplankton biomass but significantly altered
   community composition by favoring phytoflagellates (Mallomonas, Synura,
   Trachelomonas) over larger filamentous green algae (Mougeotia,
   Phymatodocis). Warming did not significantly increase dissolved nitrogen
   and phosphorus concentrations. Therefore, warmer growing conditions and
   reduced grazer biomass best explained the increased abundance of more
   edible, fast-growing phytoflagellates in the warmed mesocosms. Our
   findings support the hypothesis that moderate warming can destabilize
   plankton dynamics, thereby potentially reducing the reliability of water
   quality and food resources for higher trophic levels (e.g.,
   planktivorous fish) in shallow cold-water ecosystems.

AB Statistical models of the realized niche of species are increasingly
   used, but systematic comparisons of alternative methods are still
   limited. In particular, only few studies have explored the effect of
   scale in model outputs. In this paper. we investigate the predictive
   ability of three statistical methods (generalized linear models,
   generalized additive models and classification tree analysis) using
   species distribution data at three scales: fine (Catalonia),
   intermediate (Portugal) and coarse (Europe). Four Mediterranean tree
   species were modelled for comparison. Variables selected by models were
   relatively consistent across scales and the predictive accuracy of
   models varied only slightly. However, there were slight differences in
   the performance of methods. Classification tree analysis had a lower
   accuracy than the generalized methods, especially at finer scales. The
   performance of generalized linear models also increased with scale. At
   the fine scale GLM with linear terms showed better accuracy than GLM
   with quadratic and polynomial terms. This is probably because
   distributions at finer scales represent a linear sub-sample of entire
   realized niches of species. In contrast to GLM, the performance of GAM
   was constant across scales being more data-oriented. The predictive
   accuracy of GAM was always at least equal to other techniques,
   suggesting that this modelling approach is more robust to variations of
   scale because it can deal with any response shape.

AB The tensegrity model hypothesizes that cytoskeleton-based microtubules
   (MTs) carry compression as they balance a portion of cell contractile
   stress. To test this hypothesis, we used traction force microscopy to
   measure traction at the interface of adhering human airway smooth muscle
   cells and a flexible polyacrylamide gel substrate. The prediction is
   that if MTs balance a portion of contractile stress, then, upon their
   disruption, the portion of stress balanced by MTs would shift to the
   substrate, thereby causing an increase in traction. Measurements were
   done first in maximally activated cells (10 muM histamine) and then
   again after MTs had been disrupted (1 muM colchicine). We found that
   after disruption of MTs, traction increased on average by similar to13%.
   Because in activated cells colchicine induced neither an increase in
   intracellular Ca2+ nor an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation
   as shown previously, we concluded that the observed increase in traction
   was a result of load shift from MTs to the substrate. In addition,
   energy stored in the flexible substrate was calculated as work done by
   traction on the deformation of the substrate. This result was then
   utilized in an energetic analysis. We assumed that cytoskeleton-based
   MTs are slender elastic rods supported laterally by intermediate
   filaments and that MTs buckle as the cell contracts. Using the
   post-buckling equilibrium theory of Euler struts, we found that energy
   stored during buckling of MTs was quantitatively consistent with the
   measured increase in substrate energy after disruption of MTs. This is
   further evidence supporting the idea that MTs are intracellular
   compression-bearing elements.

AB The relative abundances of small centric diatoms have increased in many
   Arctic lakes over the past century, with these changes commonly
   attributed to warming. However, the specific mechanisms by which diatom
   community structure is changing in response to warming remain unclear.
   We investigated the responses of two common centric diatoms to nutrient
   enrichment and incubation depth, the latter used to manipulate light
   availability which is a key factor that changes with altered mixing
   depths in lakes. We conducted 2 x 2 factorial experiments, manipulating
   nutrients (none added or N + P addition) and incubation depth (shallow
   or deep), and measured changes in growth rates and cell densities of
   Discostella stelligera and Puncticulata radiosa. A second set of
   experiments was conducted on D. stelligera in a growth chamber to
   separate temperature and light effects associated with incubation depth.
   Puncticulata radiosa was always more abundant in the shallow depth
   incubations, regardless of nutrient conditions. In contrast, D.
   stelligera responded most strongly to nutrient additions, and cell
   densities of this species were affected by interactions between
   nutrients and incubation depth or light. Our research suggests that
   processes that alter light availability (such as water clarity and water
   column stability) and nutrient concentrations are likely to play a major
   role in controlling the growth of small centric diatoms in Arctic lakes.

AB During the last quarter of a century, the evolution of the thermal
   sensitivity of performance in ectotherms has become a major focus of
   research programs in evolutionary physiology. Graphical and mathematical
   models describe how the relationship between body temperature and
   performance. termed the performance function. should evolve in response
   to the thermal environment. Interspecific comparisons of the thermal
   sensitivity of locomotor performance have revealed that the performance
   function is evolutionarily labile in some taxa but is more conservative
   in others. A lack of heritable variation or weak selection on
   performance may explain the conservation of thermal physiology in
   certain groups. but evolutionary trade-offs do not appear to have been
   important constraints. Other aspects of thermal physiology, such as the
   thermal sensitivity of growth rate, have evolved rapidly in ectotherms.
   Despite the apparent lability of thermal physiology in some taxa. there
   is limited evidence that thermoregulator behavior and thermal physiology
   are coadapted. Future studies should broaden taxonomic and phenotypic
   foci, while paying close attention to the assumptions of current
   theories. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many frogs from temperate climates can tolerate low temperatures and
   increase their thermal tolerance through hardening and acclimation. Most
   tropical frogs, on the other hand, fail to acclimate to low
   temperatures. This lack of acclimation ability is potentially due to
   lack of selection pressure for acclimation because cold weather is less
   common in the tropics. We tested the generality of this pattern by
   characterizing the critical temperature minimum (CTMin), hardening, and
   acclimation responses of tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). These
   frogs belong to a family with unknown thermal ecology. They are found in
   a tropical habitat with a highly constant temperature regime. The CTMin
   of the tadpoles was on average 12.5 degrees C. Pre-metamorphic tadpoles
   hardened by 1.18 degrees C, while metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 0.36
   degrees C. When raised at 21 degrees C, tadpoles acclimated expanding
   their cold tolerance by 1.3 degrees C in relation to larvae raised at 28
   degrees C. These results indicate that the tungara frog has a greatly
   reduced cold tolerance when compared to species from temperate climates,
   but it responds to cold temperatures with hardening and acclimation
   comparable to those of temperate-zone species. Cold tolerance increased
   with body length but cold hardening was more extensive in
   pre-metamorphic tadpoles than in metamorphic ones. This study shows that
   lack of acclimation ability is not general to the physiology of tropical
   anurans.

AB Climate change is threatening reproduction of many ectotherms by
   increasing nest temperatures, potentially making it more difficult for
   females to locate nest sites that provide suitable incubation regimes
   during embryonic development. Elevated nest temperatures could increase
   the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or maladaptive phenotypes. We
   investigated whether elevated nest temperatures reduce hatching success
   in tropical flatback turtles (Natator depressus) nesting in the Gulf of
   Carpentaria, Australia. Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees
   C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up
   to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C. Elevated nest temperatures
   did not reduce hatching success or hatchling body size relative to
   control temperatures (29.5 degrees C), but did speed up embryonic
   development. A combination of sudden exposure to high temperatures
   during the first 2 weeks of incubation (>36 degrees C for 48 h) and
   prolonged warming throughout incubation (from 29.5-35 degrees C) did not
   reduce hatching success. We also recorded an unusually high pivotal
   sex-determining temperature in this flatback turtle population relative
   to other sea turtle populations: an equal ratio of male and female
   hatchlings is produced at similar to 30.4 degrees C. This adaptation may
   allow some flatback turtle populations to continue producing large
   numbers of hatchlings of both sexes under the most extreme climate
   change scenarios. Some tropical populations of nesting flatbacks may
   possess important adaptations to high-temperature incubation
   environments, which are not found in more southerly temperate
   populations.

AB Trait variation is normally separated into genetic and environmental
   components, yet genetic factors also control the expression of
   environmental variation, encompassing plasticity across environmental
   gradients and within-environment responses. We defined four components
   of environmental variation: plasticity across environments, variability
   in plasticity, variation within environments, and differences in
   within-environment variation across environments. We assessed these
   components for cold tolerance across five rearing temperatures using the
   Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). The four
   components were found to be heritable, and genetically correlated to
   different extents. By whole genome single marker regression, we detected
   multiple candidate genes controlling the four components and showed
   limited overlap in genes affecting them. Using the binary UAS-GAL4
   system, we functionally validated the effects of a subset of candidate
   genes affecting each of the four components of environmental variation
   and also confirmed the genetic and phenotypic correlations obtained from
   the DGRP in distinct genetic backgrounds. We delineate selection targets
   associated with environmental variation and the constraints acting upon
   them, providing a framework for evolutionary and applied studies on
   environmental sensitivity. Based on our results we suggest that the
   traditional quantitative genetic view of environmental variation and
   genotype-by-environment interactions needs revisiting.

AB Microtubules are highly dynamic biopolymer filaments involved in a wide
   variety of biological processes including cell division, migration, and
   intracellular transport. Microtubules are very rigid and form a stiff
   structural scaffold that resists deformation. However, despite their
   rigidity, inside of cells they typically exhibit significant bends on
   all length scales. Here, we investigate the origin of these bends using
   a Fourier analysis approach to quantify their length and time
   dependence. We show that, in cultured animal cells, bending is
   suppressed by the surrounding elastic cytoskeleton, and even large
   intracellular forces only cause significant bending fluctuations on
   short length scales. However, these lateral bending fluctuations also
   naturally cause fluctuations in the orientation of the microtubule tip.
   During growth, these tip fluctuations lead to microtubule bends that are
   frozen-in by the surrounding elastic network. This results in a
   persistent random walk of the microtubule, with a small apparent
   persistence length of approximate to 30 mu m, approximate to 100 times
   smaller than that resulting from thermal fluctuations alone. Thus, large
   nonthermal forces govern the growth of microtubules and can explain the
   highly curved shapes observed in the microtubule cytoskeleton of living
   cells.

AB Background One hypothesis for the function of sleep is that it serves as
   a mechanism to conserve energy. Recent studies have suggested that
   increased sleep can be an adaptive mechanism to improve survival under
   food deprivation inDrosophila melanogaster. To test the generality of
   this hypothesis, we compared sleep and its plastic response to
   starvation in a temperate and tropical population ofDrosophila
   melanogaster. Results We found that flies from the temperate population
   were more starvation resistant, and hypothesized that they would engage
   in behaviors that are considered to conserve energy, including increased
   sleep and reduced movement. Surprisingly, temperate flies slept less and
   moved more when they were awake compared to tropical flies, both under
   fed and starved conditions, therefore sleep did not correlate with
   population-level differences in starvation resistance. In contrast,
   total sleep and percent change in sleep when starved were strongly
   positively correlated with starvation resistance within the tropical
   population, but not within the temperate population. Thus, we observe
   unexpectedly complex relationships between starvation and sleep that
   vary both within and across populations. These observations falsify the
   simple hypothesis of a straightforward relationship between sleep and
   energy conservation. We also tested the hypothesis that starvation is
   correlated with metabolic phenotypes by investigating stored lipid and
   carbohydrate levels, and found that stored metabolites partially
   contributed towards variation starvation resistance. Conclusions Our
   findings demonstrate that the function of sleep under starvation can
   rapidly evolve on short timescales and raise new questions about the
   physiological correlates of sleep and the extent to which variation in
   sleep is shaped by natural selection.

AB The ecological trade-off between developmental time and starvation
   resistance, acting in a heterogeneous environment, can promote the
   coexistence of competing species. Heterogeneity results from variation
   in the vegetation that influences both abiotic (e.g. temperature,
   humidity) and biotic (e.g. fruit availability during the year) aspects
   of the environment. In this study, we investigated whether differences
   between collection sites have led to local differentiation of the two
   life-history traits underlying the coexistence model: developmental time
   and starvation resistance. Drosophila were collected from four
   collection sites, ranging from grassland to secondary forest, along a
   transect of 15 km. The microclimatic and vegetation differences among
   these collection sites were considerable. For developmental time,
   different species showed similar genetic responses to the (habitat)
   differences between the different collection sites. The shortest
   developmental times were found in the secondary forest populations and

AB It has generally been assumed that the photosynthetic quantum yield of
   all C-3 plants is essentially the same for all unstressed leaves at the
   same temperature and CO2 and O-2 concentrations. However, some recent
   work by H.C. Timm et al. (2002, Trees 16:47-62) has shown that quantum
   yield can be reduced for some time after leaves have been exposed to
   darkness. To investigate under what light conditions quantum yield can
   be reduced, we carried out a number of experiments on leaves of a
   partial-shade (unlit greenhouse)-grown Coleus blumei Benth. hybrid. We
   found that after leaves had been exposed to complete darkness, quantum
   yield was reduced by about 60%. Only very low light levels were needed
   for quantum yield to be fully restored, with 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1)
   being sufficient for 85% of the quantum yield of fully induced leaves to
   be achieved. Leaves regained higher quantum yields upon exposure to
   higher light levels with an estimated time constant of 130 s. It was
   concluded that the loss of quantum yield would be quantitatively
   important only for leaves growing in very dense understoreys where
   maximum light levels might not exceed 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1) even in
   the middle of the day. Most leaves, even in understorey conditions, do,
   however, experience light levels in excess of 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1)
   over periods where they obtain most of their carbon so that the loss of
   quantum yield would affect total carbon gain of those leaves only
   marginally.

AB The life history of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) has been
   intensively studied in the United States, but little information exists
   for Canadian populations, which limits the ability to perform analyses
   of latitudinal trends in this species. To investigate variations in body
   size, age structures, longevity, and growth, we used drift fences to
   sample populations in four habitats (from mixed to deciduous forests)
   Within a 12 km radius in the Mastigouche Reserve located in Quebec,
   Canada. During the active season of 1997, we captured, measured and
   sexed (except neonates) a total of 775 salamanders, and estimated the
   age of 330 of these specimens using skeletochronology. The population
   characterized by highest mean body size and/or mean age was from a mixed
   forest that also harbored the greatest abundance of salamanders. For all
   populations combined, body size (SVL) ranged from 12-46 mm for males and
   12-54 mm for females, and longevity reached 8 yr in females and 9 yr in
   males. Adult males showed lower mean SVL and mean age than adult females
   (41.0 mm, 5.2 yr vs. 44.8 mm, 5.8 yr, respectively). Accordingly, von
   Bertalanffy growth models indicated a higher asymptotic body size and a
   lower growth coefficient in females. For 7 out of 8 analyses, age was
   significantly correlated with SVL in animals >= 4 yr old; the strength
   of these correlations was greater in females than in males and
   significantly correlated with SVL range. Comparisons with other
   populations reveal that age and size at maturity in P. cinereus increase
   with latitudes in both sexes. However, females, but not males, show a
   slight increase in mean adult body size with latitudes, leading to a
   positive allometric relationship between body size and sexual size
   dimorphism, the northern populations being more dimorphic. Body
   increment during the first year of growth was found similar to lowest
   values reported for other small species of Plethodon from the United
   States but much reduced compared to conspecific populations from the
   U.S.A. Factors related to latitude (e.g., temperature, duration of
   activity season) seem responsible for the observed differences.

AB Survival of a potentially lethal high temperature stress is a
   genetically variable thermal adaptation trait in many organisms.
   Organisms cope with heat stress by basal or induced thermoresistance.
   Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat stress survival
   (HSS) in Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a cyclic
   heat-hardening pre-treatment, for flies that were reared at low (LD) or
   high (HD) density. Mapping populations were two panels of recombinant
   inbred lines (RIL), which were previously constructed from heat
   stress-selected stocks: RIL-D48 and RIL-SH2, derived from backcrosses to
   stocks of low and high heat resistance, respectively. HSS increased with
   heat hardening in both LD and HD flies. In addition, HSS increased
   consistently with density in non-hardened flies. There was a significant
   interaction between heat hardening and density effects in RIL-D48.
   Several QTL were significant for both density and hardening treatments.
   Many QTL overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified for other traits
   in previous studies based on LD cultures only. However, three new QTL
   were found in HD only (cytological ranges: 12E-16F6; 30A3-34C2;
   49C-50C). Previously found thermotolerance QTL were also significant for
   flies from HD cultures.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the time-of-day effects on the
   offensive capability and aerobic performance in football game in young
   subjects. In a randomized order, participants realized the Yo-Yo
   intermittent recovery test in two test sessions and a football game
   situations (two 15-min games), interspersed by a verbalization sequence
   (3 min) at 08:00 and 17:00 h on separate days. A recovery period of 24 h
   was permitted between two consecutive test sessions. The results
   revealed diurnal variations on the maximal aerobic velocity during the
   Yo-Yo test (MAV) and the oral temperature with higher values in the
   afternoon than morning (p < 0.05). Concerning offensive capability, the
   numbers of scored goals were significantly higher at 17:00 h in
   comparison with 08:00 h (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant
   difference between 08:00 and 17:00 h for the kicked balls (shooting
   parameter). In conclusion, our findings suggest that performance was
   improved in the evening and the parameters (shooting and Scored goals)
   can be used as a model to describe the offensive capacity in football
   game depending on the time of day.

AB The ability to withstand high summer temperatures is an extremely
   important determinant of species distributions in the intertidal zone;
   most marine organisms cannot live intertidally because of the harsh
   conditions experienced during aerial emersion. The members of some
   species, though, live both intertidally and subtidally, and their
   physiological tolerance to stressors may differ depending on their
   genetic connectivity, acclimatization, and differential post settlement
   mortality. Furthermore, tolerances of organisms at different
   life-history stages within both habitats may differ and will play an
   important role in determining adult distributions. To determine the
   effect of habitat and life-history stage on physiological tolerance and
   the likely contribution of upper thermal tolerance limits to the native
   distribution of an important invasive species, the slippershell snail
   Crepidula fornicata, we compared the thermal tolerance of intertidal and
   subtidal embryos and adults in relation to conditions that they
   experience in the field. We found C. fornicata living both intertidally
   and subtidally in Bissel Cove, Rhode Island, where they experienced
   drastically different thermal conditions. Intertidal individuals
   achieved body temperatures as high as 42 degrees C, more than 15 degrees
   C higher than those recorded in subtidal conspecifics. However, subtidal
   individuals had remarkably high thermal tolerances that were nearly
   identical to those of intertidal conspecifics (lethal range = 33-37
   degrees C following a 3 h exposure). Furthermore, embryos were even more
   tolerant to high thermal stress than adults. These results are
   surprising: the few previous studies that have compared thermal
   tolerances among individuals at different life-history stages have found
   differences among them, and early stages are generally more sensitive
   than adults. Interestingly, the markedly higher temperatures that
   intertidal animals experienced in this study had little effect on their
   thermal tolerance. Intertidal (but not subtidal) slippershell snails are
   now living dangerously close to their upper thermal limits and will
   almost certainly be relegated to the subtidal as global temperatures
   rise.

AB Global climate change may be affecting forests around the world.
   However, the impact of climate change on forest population dynamics,
   especially at the landscape or regional level, has hardly been addressed
   before. A new methodology was proposed to enable matrix transition
   models to account for climate impact on forest population dynamics. The
   first climate-sensitive matrix (CSMatrix) model was developed for the
   Alaska boreal forest based on observations from over 15 years of forest
   inventory. The spatially explicit model was used to map climate-induced
   forest population dynamics across the region. The model predicted that
   the basal area increment in the region under natural succession would be
   hindered by global warming, more so for dry upland areas than for moist
   wetlands. It was suggested that temperature-induced drought stress could
   more than offset a predicted increase of future precipitation in the
   region to lower overall forest productivity. At the same time, stand
   diversity would increase across the region through transient species
   redistribution. Accounting for climate conditions made the CSMatrix
   model more accurate than conventional matrix models. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   organismal structure, physiology and fitness. Here, we assessed the
   effect of developmental acclimation to environmental thermal variability
   on walking speed in Drosophila melanogaster adults. Our results showed a
   shift in the performance curve to the right. Thus, upper and lower
   thermal limits exhibited developmental plasticity. Additionally, in
   constant and variable climatic scenarios, flies shifted to the right the
   optimum temperature but the maximum performance decreased only in flies
   reared on high temperatures and high thermal variability. Overall, we
   showed that environmental cues during ontogeny might help to construct

   in order to assess the role of the species in the energy how and
   secondary production in this type of agro-ecosystem Two main annual
   cohorts (1995 and 1996 cohorts) were identified. The females outnumbered
   males and the average female/male-ratio was 4. The inspection of ovary
   developmental stages of this viviparous fish, revealed that the most
   important reproductive period was between April and August. The first
   recruits were recorded in June and were present thereafter until
   October. Males from the parental cohort died before August, whereas
   parental females could survive until October. Mean adjusted fecundity
   (number of embryos divided by female standard length) peaked in July
   1996 (0.95) and in June 1997 (1.05). Females reached greater sizes, had
   a higher growth rate and lived longer than males. Annual production was
   estimated at 3.101 g.m(-2).year(-1) (ash-free dry weight, AFDW), the
   average biomass at 2.896 g.m(-2) (AFDW), and the P/B ratio was 1.071. A
   conjugation of life history, population dynamics, production and
   ecological traits (e.g. fast growth, reduced longevity, viviparity, high
   productivity, an intermediate position in food chain, and no special

AB Spring phytoplankton blooms contribute a substantial part to annual
   production, support pelagic and benthic secondary production and
   influence biogeochemical cycles in many temperate aquatic systems.
   Understanding environmental effects on spring bloom dynamics is
   important for predicting future climate responses and for managing
   aquatic systems. We analyzed long-term phytoplankton data from one
   coastal and one offshore station in the Baltic Sea to uncover trends in
   timing, composition and size of the spring bloom and its correlations to
   environmental variables. There was a general trend of earlier
   phytoplankton blooms by 1-2 weeks over the last 20 years, associated
   with more sunshine and less windy conditions. High water temperatures
   were associated with earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates that
   dominate the spring bloom, and decreased diatom bloom magnitude. Overall
   bloom timing, however, was buffered by a temperature and ice related
   shift in composition from early blooming diatoms to later blooming
   dinoflagellates and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum. Such
   counteracting responses to climate change highlight the importance of
   both general and taxon-specific investigations. We hypothesize that the
   predicted earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates as a response to
   the expected temperature increase in the Baltic Sea might also be
   counteracted by more clouds and stronger winds. A shift from early
   blooming and fast sedimenting diatoms to later blooming groups of
   dinoflagellates and M. rubrum at higher temperatures during the spring
   period is expected to increase energy transfers to pelagic secondary
   production and decrease spring bloom inputs to the benthic system,
   resulting in lower benthic production and reduced oxygen consumption.

AB Background: The accuracy by which phenotype can be reproduced by
   genotype potentially is important in determining the stability,
   environmental sensitivity, and evolvability of morphology and other
   phenotypic traits. Because two sides of an individual represent
   independent development of the phenotype under identical genetic and
   environmental conditions, average body asymmetry (or '' fluctuating
   asymmetry '') can estimate the developmental instability of the
   population. The component of developmental instability not explained by
   intrapopulational differences in gene or environment (or their
   interaction) can be further defined as internal developmental noise.
   Surprisingly, developmental noise remains largely unexplored despite its
   potential influence on our interpretations of developmental stability,
   canalization, and evolvability. Proponents of fluctuating asymmetry as a
   bioindicator of environmental or genetic stress, often make the
   assumption that developmental noise is minimal and, therefore, that
   phenotype can respond sensitively to the environment. However,
   biologists still have not measured whether developmental noise actually
   comprises a significant fraction of the overall environmental response
   of fluctuating asymmetry observed within a population.
   Results: In a morphometric study designed to partition developmental
   noise from fluctuating asymmetry in the wing morphology of a monoclonal
   culture of cotton aphid, Aphis gossipyii, it was discovered that
   fluctuating asymmetry in the aphid wing was nearly four times higher
   than in other insect species. Also, developmental noise comprised a
   surprisingly large fraction (approximate to 50%) of the overall response
   of fluctuating asymmetry to a controlled graded temperature environment.
   Fluctuating asymmetry also correlated negatively with temperature,
   indicating that environmentally-stimulated changes in developmental
   instability are mediated mostly by changes in the development time of
   individuals.
   Conclusion: The amount of developmental noise revealed in this trait
   potentially does interfere with a substantial amount of the sensitivity
   of fluctuating asymmetry to change in temperature. Assuming that some
   genetic-based variation in individual buffering of developmental
   instability exists in natural aphid populations, the amount of internal
   developmental noise determined in this study could also substantially
   reduce evolvability of the aphid wing. The overall findings here suggest
   that individual response to the seemingly high cost of stabilizing some
   aspects of the phenotype may account for the frequent observation of
   trait and species specificity in levels of fluctuating asymmetry.

AB Climate change and biological invasions pose one of the greatest threats
   to biodiversity. Most analyses of the potential biological impacts have
   focused on changes in mean temperature, but changes in thermal variance
   may also impact native and invasive organisms, although differentially.
   We assessed the combined effects of the mean and the variance of
   temperature on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp90) in adults of
   the invasive fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the native Drosophila
   gaucha in Mediterranean habitats of central Chile. We observed that,
   under these experimental conditions, hsp90 mRNA expression was higher in
   the invasive species but absent in the native one. Apparently, the
   biogeographic origin and niche conservatisms are playing a role in the
   heat shock response of these species under different putative scenarios
   of climate change. We suggest that in order to develop more realistic
   predictions about the biological impact of climate change and biological
   invasions, one must consider the interactions between the mean and

AB Circadian rhythm disruption (i. e., arrhythmicity) in motor activity is
   an abnormal behavioral pattern. In rats, it can be caused by the lesion
   of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and by prolonged
   exposure to constant light (LL). We carried out a comparative study of
   these arrhythmic phenotypes to assess the role of the SCN in the
   regulation of the motor output beyond circadian rhythmicity. Motor
   activity series were studied in rats that had become arrhythmic as a
   result of 1) LL exposure at 2 light intensities: 300 lux (LL300) and 1.3
   lux (LL1.3), and 2) SCN lesion (SCNx). The Fourier spectra, the fractal
   Hurst coefficient (H) from the autocorrelation function, and the beta
   slope from the power spectral density were calculated in data sections
   at baseline, when the rats were still rhythmic, and later at stages with
   undetectable circadian rhythms. In the LL300 group, high power content
   was detected at frequencies of 8 to 4 h (i. e., ultradian). Lower power
   content for these harmonics was found in the LL1.3 group, whereas no
   dominant harmonics appeared in the SCNx group. Independently of the
   manifestation of circadian rhythm, H values were higher and more
   sustained in time in rats exposed to LL300 but gradually decreased in
   rats exposed to LL1.3. Fractal correlation was found in control DD group
   but was absent in the SCNx group. We conclude that scale-invariant
   regulation of the motor pattern by SCN activity is dependent on light
   intensity but independent of the circadian rhythm output. Adjusting the
   light intensity by modifying the coupling degree between the population
   of oscillations could affect the dynamics of each individual oscillator
   in the SCN, making it less predictable.

AB Activated thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a
   carboxypeptidase B-like plasma enzyme that can slow clot lysis by
   removing lysine residues exposed on fibrin as it is cleaved by plasmin.
   Previously, it was shown that fibrin treated with TAFIa is less able to
   promote plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator. In
   this study, the effect of TAFIa modification of a fibrin surface on the
   rate of plasmin inhibition by antiplasmin was studied using high
   molecular weight fibrin degradation products (HMw-FDPs) as a soluble
   model for intact plasmin-modified fibrin. To quantify the inhibition, a
   novel end point assay was employed where plasmin, antiplasmin, and
   cofactors were mixed in the presence of a chromogenic substrate and the
   end point in the substrate hydrolysis reaction was used to measure the
   second order rate constant of inhibition. When HMw-FDPs were titrated in
   the presence of plasmin and antiplasmin, the rate constant for
   inhibition decreased by 16-fold at saturation (9.6 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) to
   0.59 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)). When HMw-FDPs were pretreated with TAFIa,
   nearly two-thirds of the protective effect was lost. When 730 nM
   HMw-FDPs were treated for 20 min with TAFIa, the rate constant for
   plasmin inhibition was increased 3-fold from 1.9 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) to
   6.2 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1). Therefore, a novel mechanism was identified
   whereby TAFIa can modulate plasmin levels by increasing the
   susceptibility of plasmin to inhibition by antiplasmin.

AB Aim We examine issues of uncertainty regarding the spatial and temporal
   representativeness of phenological observations using a newly compiled
   Europe-wide data base of phenological observations for Betula species.
   Location Europe.
   Methods A new data base was compiled from national phenological
   observations covering 15 European countries, with the longest
   observational periods exceeding several decades for some sites. From
   this, the spatial and temporal representativeness of phenological
   observations were evaluated via statistical analysis.
   Results The results showed that there was a significant and irreducible
   uncertainty related to the use of data of a single station, which varied
   from 3 to 8 days depending on the station location. In more continental
   and northern climatic zones the uncertainty was lower, probably due to
   faster spring-time weather developments. In mild climatic conditions,
   the uncertainty of dates of the phenological phases registered by a
   single station exceeded 1 week. The considerable number of data allowed
   us to preliminarily estimate the features of some stations, marking them
   as 'late', 'early', 'representative' or 'random', depending on the dates
   reported by these sites and the corresponding regional means.
   Main conclusions The uncertainties discovered in single-site
   phenological observations are significant for virtually any potential
   application. Possible approaches for handling the uncertainty problem
   are station pre-averaging and spatial regularization of the data set,
   pre-selection (down-sampling) or changing the description of the
   phenomena from deterministic to probabilistic.

AB The geographic extent of Asia and the Pacific leads to great variation
   in the climate of the region. Major influences on global climate arise
   from the scale and elevation of the Himalayan Tibetan Plateau (HTP), and
   from the air-sea interactions in the Pacific associated with the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The monsoon has a profound effect on
   the climate of Asia, with its strong seasonal cycle. Variability is also
   caused by ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO). ENSO is the principal source of inter-annual global
   climate variability. ENSO has significant climate and societal impacts
   on both regional and global scales. The climate effects of ENSO are
   modulated on decadal time scales by the PDO. IOD affects the climate in
   the Indian Ocean and Australasia. Climate observations show significant
   warming trends in temperature across Asia and the Pacific; not only is
   there an increase in mean temperature, but there is more warming in
   North Asia and less in the Pacific during the twentieth century.
   Observed trends in precipitation are more variable, with some evidence
   of increasing intensity of storms. Glacier mass balance studies show
   dramatic decline in ice mass in the Himalayas and New Zealand, with
   monitored ice mass losses of 0.3-0.5 km(2)/year, in the last three
   decades. Temperature extremes have changed region wide: cool nights,
   cold days have very significantly decreased universally, and the
   frequency of hot days has increased. Projections of future climate
   change for the region suggest longer summer heat waves in South and East
   Asia and Australia, and increases in precipitation in several areas.
   Regional downscaling techniques are used to project future climate:
   warming is projected to be largest in high latitude (Northern Asia,
   Central Asia) and high altitude (Tibetan Plateau) regions; with a
   suppression of the south Asian summer monsoon, along with a delay of
   monsoon onset and increase of monsoon break periods. Monsoon
   precipitation is projected to increase over South Asia.

AB 1. Around the year 2000, historically abundant populations of brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (S. salar) co-occurring in
   rivers flowing along the Cantabrian corridor of north-western Spain
   showed a dramatic decline to alarming levels. For one reason or another,
   fishing was not banned and fishing pressure continued to reduce the few
   survivors. Unexpectedly, the populations recovered 'naturally' in a very
   short time period to the extent that in 2004-06 numbers had attained
   population sizes comparable to those of the mid 1980s.
   2. The population of brown trout in Rio Chaballos showed a boom-and-bust
   pattern concurrent with those observed across broader geographical
   scales. This study revisits a 22-year data set to explore the nature of
   the severe decline and rapid recovery of this population.
   3. Recruitment was related to stream discharge in March that covers the
   emergence period and the earliest search stages for food. Coefficients
   of variation for discharge and recruitment increased over the years and
   were highly correlated with each other, demonstrating that increased
   temporal variability in recruitment is strongly linked to increased
   variability in stream discharge. In turn, recruitment appears to be the
   major determinant of year-class strength and hence, of population size.
   4. A number of factors appeared to operate as resilience mechanisms,
   permitting the population to increase rapidly when environmental
   conditions are optimal. These include strong recruitment-discharge
   relationships, short life-span, small stocks of eggs or offspring
   required to fill the amount of space suitable for the youngest juveniles
   and a few females surviving to spawn for a second time.
   5. Implications for fishery management and conservation are discussed in
   the context of the expectation that these populations will vary over the
   coming years within ranges similar to those in this study.

AB This study represents a step towards developing seasonal climate
   inferences by using high-resolution modern data sets. The importance of
   seasonal climate changes is highlighted by the instrumental record of a
   meteorological station close to our study site (lac du Sommet in the
   Laurentian Mountains, Quebec, Canada): Between 1966 and 2001, May
   temperatures increased significantly by 3.1 degrees C (r = 0.41, n = 35,
   p < 0.01) but annual mean temperatures only by 0.6 degrees C (r = 0,21,
   n = 35, p > 0.05). Comparison of this instrumental record with fossil
   diatom assemblages in a sediment core from lac du Sommet showed that
   axis one of a principal component analysis (PCA) of the fossil diatoms
   was best correlated with wind velocity in June (r = 0.62, n = 19, p <
   0.005) and that past diatom production was significantly enhanced in
   periods with colder July temperatures (r = -0.77, n = 19, p < 0.0005)
   and higher wind velocity in June (r = 77, n = 19, p < 0.0005). The
   strong impact of the spring and summer conditions on overall diatom
   composition and productivity suggests that seasonal lake responses to
   climate are more important than annual mean temperatures. However, the
   seasonal dynamics of diatom communities are not well understood, and
   seasonality is rarely inferred effectively from lake sediment studies.
   Our research presents a pilot study to answer a twofold question: Is it
   possible to identify diatom communities which are typical for warmer or
   colder seasonal climate using sediment traps, and if it is, can this
   knowledge be used to infer seasonal climate conditions from fossil
   diatom assemblages? To address these questions, the seasonal dynamics of
   diatom communities and water chemistry were studied using sediment traps
   and water samples at biweekly intervals in four lakes distributed along
   an altitudinal gradient in the Laurentian Mountains from May through
   October 2002. Date of ice break-up was significantly related to the
   diatom assemblages taken in spring and uncorrelated to other significant
   environmental variables. Summer water temperature, circulation of the
   water column and pH explained a significant part of the biological
   variance in summer, and total nitrogen (TN) explained most of the
   biological variance in autumn. To infer these variables, weighted
   averaging partial least squares models were applied to the seasonal data
   sets. Inferred ice break-up dates were significantly correlated with
   number of days below 0 degrees C in April (r = 0.52, n = 19, p < 0.025),
   inferred circulation of the water column was significantly related to
   measured wind velocity in June (r = 0.64, n = 19, p < 0.005), inferred
   summer water temperature and inferred pH was significantly related to
   measured July air temperature (r = 0.50, r = -53, n = 19, p < 0.025) and
   inferred TN autumn concentrations had an inverse relationship to August
   temperatures (r = -0.53, n = 19, p < 0.01). This comparison of the
   historical record with diatominferred seasonal climate signals, based on
   the comparison of fossil diatom assemblages with modern sediment trap
   data of high temporal resolution, provides a promising new approach for
   the reconstruction of seasonal climate aspects in paleolimnological
   studies.

AB As the most rigid cytoskeletal filaments, microtubules bear compressive
   forces in living cells, balancing the tensile forces within the
   cytoskeleton to maintain the cell shape. It is often observed that, in
   living cells, microtubules under compression severely buckle into short
   wavelengths. By contrast, when compressed, isolated microtubules in
   vitro buckle into single long-wavelength arcs. The critical buckling
   force of the microtubules in vitro is two orders of magnitude lower than
   that of the microtubules in living cells. To explain this discrepancy,
   we describe a mechanics model of microtubule buckling in living cells.
   The model investigates the effect of the surrounding filament network
   and the cytosol on the microtubule buckling. The results show that,
   while the buckling wavelength is set by the interplay between the
   microtubules and the elastic surrounding filament network, the buckling
   growth rate is set by the viscous cytosol. By considering the nonlinear
   deformation of the buckled microtubule, the buckling amplitude can be
   determined at the kinetically constrained equilibrium. The model
   quantitatively correlates the microtubule bending rigidity, the
   surrounding filament network elasticity, and the cytosol viscosity with
   the buckling wavelength, the buckling growth rate, and the buckling
   amplitude of the microtubules. Such results shed light on designing a
   unified experimental protocol to measure various critical mechanical
   properties of subcellular structures in living cells. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Water and salt concentrations in an animal's body fluids can fluctuate

   that require behavioral and physiological adjustments. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate body water dynamics in the estuarine
   diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), a species that undergoes
   seasonal dormancy in salt marsh habitats. We conducted a field study to
   determine the total body water (% TBW), water turnover rate (WTR) and
   daily water flux (DWF) of female terrapins in south eastern North
   Carolina pre-and post-emergence from winter dormancy. Terrapins were
   injected with [H-2] deuterium on two occasions and washout of the
   isotope was monitored by taking successive blood samples during the
   period of transition from dormancy to activity. The WTR and DWF of
   dormant terrapins were significantly lower than those of active
   terrapins (WTRdormant= 49.70 +/- 15.94 ml day(-1), WTRactive= 100.20 +/-
   20.36 ml day(-1), DWFdormant= 10.52 +/- 2.92% TBW day(-1), DWFactive=
   21.84 +/- 7.30% TBW day(-1)). There was no significant difference in %
   TBW between dormant and active terrapins (75.05 +/- 6.19% and 74.54 +/-
   4.36%, respectively). The results from this field study provide insight
   into the terrapin's ability to maintain osmotic homeostasis while
   experiencing shifts in behavioral and environmental conditions.

AB The objective of the first experiment was to determine effects of
   feeding time and dietary forage to concentrate ratio on diurnal averages
   and rhythms of blood urea (BU). Four multiparous (body weight, BW = 652
   +/- 14 kg, mean +/- SD; body condition score, BCS = 2.87 +/- 0.14; days
   in milk, DIM = 83 +/- 22) and four primiparous (BW = 667 +/- 110 kg; BCS
   = 3.19 +/- 0.66; DIM = 81 +/- 23) Holstein cows were utilized in a 4 x 4
   Latin square design study with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of feeding
   time and diet type. A higher concentrate (forage to concentrate ratio =
   38.5: 61.5) or a lower concentrate (forage to concentrate ratio = 50.6:
   49.4) total mixed ration (TMR) was offered at either 2100 h or 0900 h.
   The study had four 21-d periods, with 14 d of adaptation. Blood was
   sampled every 2 h for two 24-h periods during sampling weeks. Feeding at
   2100 h vs. 0900 h increased feed consumed within 3 h of feeding time,
   from 26% to 37% of total daily intake. Total daily dry matter intake
   (DMI) was similar among treatments. BU exhibited significant diurnal
   rhythms in both groups, which depended on diet type and its interactions
   with sampling hour and time of feeding (TF). The objective of the second
   experiment was to establish diurnal and post-feeding responses in BU
   levels to feeding time in lactating cows following 28-d adaptation
   periods. Four multiparous and four primiparous lactating Holstein cows
   (82 DIM) were used in a cross-over design study with two 6-wk periods.
   Each period had 4 wk of adaptation. A TMR with 49.8% concentrate was
   offered at either 0900 or 2100 h to permit 5-10% feed refusals. Jugular
   blood was sampled via catheters every 2 h for two 24-h period during wk
   5 of each period. The proportion of daily TMR intake consumed within 3 h
   of feeding time was 55% in cows fed at 2100 h, and 46% in cows fed at
   0900 h (P<0.05). Rumen ammonia was higher at 2 h but lower at 6 h
   post-feeding and remained lower between 6 and 20 h post-feeding in cows
   fed at 2100 h vs. 0900 h. Feeding time did not affect daily averages of
   BU. BU increased shortly after feeding in morning-fed cows but not in
   evening-fed cows. BU was higher for about 12 h pre-feeding in
   evening-vs. morning-fed cows. Results establish that TF alters
   postprandial and diurnal patterns of feed intake, rumen ammonia, and
   peripheral BU. Time of eating and its interaction with diet type can
   therefore affect splanchnic and peripheral nitrogen metabolism and
   efficiency in lactating cows. Considering the comparative nature of the
   splanchnic metabolism in optimal mechanistic understanding of the gut
   function in any given species, these data could serve as a theoretical
   and in several aspects as an applied metabolic model for other
   high-producing ruminants and humans.

   juvenile standing crop increased almost three-fold between the first and
   second breeding cycles. Dark brown over-wintered adults comprised the
   majority of the population between March and April 2001, while newly
   secreted translucent adults were predominant between June and September.
   Seasonal shell Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios were positively correlated with
   water temperature at both sites, with the strongest correlations
   occurring between June and September from newly secreted shells at
   Dameron Marsh. Old, dark brown shells contained 10% to 23% and 1% to 6%
   less Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, respectively, than new shells. Because a fossil
   assemblage of L. matagordensis will contain similar to30% old shells
   (dark-brown), these results suggest that fossil Mg/Ca ratios yield an
   integrated late spring to summer temperature signal. Shell Mg/Ca and
   Sr/Ca ratios of specimens of L. matagordensis collected from living
   Zostera were positively correlated, suggesting that temperature may
   influence both elemental ratios. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of fossil shells
   of the related species Loxoconcha sp. A obtained from four sediment
   cores were also studied and exhibited a weaker correlation between the
   two elemental ratios. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microtubules are hollow cylindrical filaments of the eukaryotic
   cytoskeleton characterized by extremely low shear modulus. A remarkable
   controversy has occurred in the literature, regarding the length
   dependence of flexural rigidity of microtubules predicted by the
   classical elastic beam model. In this study, a higher order shear
   deformable beam model for microtubules is employed to study unexplained
   length-dependent flexural rigidity and Young's modulus of microtubules
   reported in the literature. The formulation allows for warping of the
   cross-section of the microtubule and eliminates the need for using
   arbitrary shear correction coefficients as in other theories. It is
   showed that vibration frequencies predicted by the present parabolic
   shear deformation theory (PSDT) are much lower than that given by the
   approximate isotropic beam model for shorter microtubules, although the
   two models give almost identical results for sufficiently long
   microtubules. It is confirmed that transverse shearing and the warping
   of the cross-section of microtubules are mainly responsible for the
   length-dependent flexural rigidity of an isolated microtubule reported
   in the literature, which cannot be explained by the widely used
   Euler-Bernoulli beam model. Indeed, the length-dependent flexural
   rigidity predicted by the present model is found to be in qualitative
   agreement with the existing experimental data (Kurachi et al., 1995;
   Pampaloni et al., 2006). These results recommend that the parabolic
   shear deformation-beam theory offers a unified simple 1D model, which
   can capture the length dependence of flexural rigidity and be applied to
   various static and dynamic problems of microtubule mechanics. (C) 2010

AB Specific inhibition of photosystem I (PSI) was observed under
   low-temperature conditions in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
   strain PCC 6803. Growth at 20 degrees C caused inhibition of PSI
   activity and increased degradation of the PSI reaction center proteins
   PsaA and PsaB, while no significant changes were found in the level and
   activity of photosystem II (PSII). BtpA, a recently identified extrinsic
   thylakoid membrane protein, was found to be a necessary regulatory
   factor for stabilization of the PsaA and PsaB proteins under such
   low-temperature conditions. At normal growth temperature (30 degrees C),
   the BtpA protein was present in the cell, and its genetic deletion
   caused an increase in the degradation of the PSI reaction center
   proteins. However, growth of Synechocystis cells at 20 degrees C or
   shifting of cultures grown at 30 degrees C to 20 degrees C led to a
   rapid accumulation of the BtpA protein, presumably to stabilize the PSI
   complex, by lowering the rates of degradation of the PsaA and PsaB
   proteins. A btpA deletion mutant strain could not grow
   photoautotrophically at low temperature, and exhibited rapid degradation
   of the PSI complex after transfer of the cells from normal to low
   temperature.

AB We tested the hypothesis that the degree of anisotropic expansion of
   plant tissues is controlled by the degree of alignment of cortical
   microtubules or cellulose microfibrils. Previously, for the primary root
   of maize (Zea mays L.), we quantified spatial profiles of expansion rate
   in length, radius, and circumference and the degree of growth anisotropy
   separately for the stele and cortex, as roots became thinner with time
   from germination or in response to low water potential (B.M. Liang, A.M.
   Dennings, R.E. Sharp, T.I. Baskin [1997] Plant Physiol 115:101-111).
   Here, for the same material, we quantified microtubule alignment with
   indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and microfibril alignment
   throughout the cell wall with polarized-light microscopy and from the
   innermost cell wall layer with electron microscopy. Throughout much of
   the growth zone, mean orientations of microtubules and microfibrils were
   transverse, consistent with their parallel alignment specifying the
   direction of maximal expansion rate (i.e. elongation). However, where
   microtubule alignment became helical, microfibrils often made helices of
   opposite handedness, showing that parallelism between these elements was
   not required for helical orientations. Finally, contrary to the
   hypothesis, the degree of growth anisotropy was not correlated with the
   degree of alignment of either microtubules or microfibrils. The
   mechanisms plants use to specify radial and tangential expansion rates
   remain uncharacterized.

AB Tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the
   species may provide valuable information about the response of tree
   growth to climate warming across climatic gradients. Dendroclimatic
   information was extracted from a network of 10 silver-fir (Abies alba)
   populations in the south-western distribution limit of the species
   (Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula). Ring-width chronologies were built for
   five stands sampled in mesic sites from the Main Range in the Pyrenees,
   and for five forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges where
   summer drought is more pronounced. The radial growth of silver-fir in
   this region is constrained by water stress during the summer previous to
   growth, as suggested by the negative relationship with previous
   September temperature and, to a lesser degree, by a positive
   relationship with previous end of summer precipitation. Climatic data
   showed a warming trend since the 1970s across the Pyrenees, with more
   severe summer droughts. The recent warming changed the climate-growth
   relationships, causing higher growth synchrony among sites, and a higher
   year-to-year growth variation, especially in the southernmost forests.
   Moving-interval response functions suggested an increasing water-stress
   effect on radial growth during the last half of the 20th century. The
   growth period under water stress has extended from summer up to early
   autumn. Forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges experienced a
   more intense water stress, as seen in a shift of their response to
   precipitation and temperature. The Main-Range sites mainly showed a
   response to warming. The intensification of water-stress during the late
   20th century might affect the future growth performance of the
   highly-fragmented A. alba populations in the southwestern distribution
   limit of the species.

AB This paper is part review and part opinion piece; it has three parts of
   increasing novelty and speculation in approach. The first presents an
   overview of how some of the major crop simulation models approach the
   issue of simulating the responses of crops to changing climatic and
   weather variables, mainly atmospheric CO2 concentration and increased
   and/or varying temperatures. It illustrates an important principle in
   models of a single cause having alternative effects and vice versa. The
   second part suggests some features, mostly missing in current crop
   models, that need to be included in the future, focussing on extreme
   events such as high temperature or extreme drought. The final opinion
   part is speculative but novel. It describes an approach to deconstruct
   resource use efficiencies into their constituent identities or elements
   based on the Kaya-Porter identity, each of which can be examined for
   responses to climate and climatic change. We give no promise that the
   final part is correct', but we hope it can be a stimulation to thought,
   hypothesis and experiment, and perhaps a new modelling approach.

   used for determining the best time of all kinds of utilizations, and
   also conservation and stability of plants' growth and breeding will
   result. Therefore, this study was performed in Tezkharab rangelands,
   where Puccinella distans is an important vegetative element that is
   consumed by livestock, to determine the suitable grazing time for this
   plant based on its phenology, for about a 4-year period (2007-2010). For
   this purpose, plant phenology and changes in its growth characteristics
   were investigated weekly. Moreover, during this period, all phenological
   stages were adjusted to the monthly precipitation and temperature. The
   results indicated that the time of phenological stages had fluctuations
   which were related to environmental conditions. The best time to start
   grazing is early May and the best time for collecting the seeds of this
   species is late July to early August.

AB We examined trends in sea ice cover between 1979 and 2002 in four months
   (March, June, September, and November) for four large (similar to 100
   000 km(2)) and 12 small (similar to 10 000 km(2)) regions of the western
   Arctic in habitats used by bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus).
   Variation in open water with year was significant in all months except
   March, but interactions between region and year were not. Open water
   increased in both large and small regions, but trends were weak with
   least-squares regression accounting for <= 34% of the total variation.
   In large regions, positive trends in open water were strongest in
   September. Linear fits were poor, however, even in the East Siberian,
   Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, where basin-scale analyses have emphasized
   dramatic sea ice loss. Small regions also showed weak positive trends in
   open water and strong interannual variability. Open water increased
   consistently in five small regions where bowhead whales have been
   observed feeding or where oceanographic models predict prey entrainment,
   including: (1) June, along the northern Chukotka coast, near Wrangel
   Island, and along the Beaufort slope; (2) September, near Wrangel
   Island, the Barrow Arc, and the Chukchi Borderland; and (3) November,
   along the Barrow Arc. Conversely, there was very little consistent
   change in sea ice cover in four small regions considered winter refugia
   for bowhead whales in the northern Bering Sea, nor in two small regions
   that include the primary springtime migration corridor in the Chukchi
   Sea. The effects of sea ice cover on bowhead whale prey availability are
   unknown but can be modeled via production and advection pathways. Our
   conceptual model suggests that reductions in sea ice cover will increase
   prey availability along both pathways for this population. This analysis
   elucidates the variability inherent in the western Arctic marine
   ecosystem at scales relevant to bowhead whales and contrasts basin-scale
   depictions of extreme sea ice retreats, thinning, and wind-driven
   movements.

AB Climate change in the Norwegian and Barents (NorBar) Seas is expected to
   generate major alterations to the marine food-web and its associated
   uses. However, our current capacity to quantify the potential ecological
   impact of physical change is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge
   regarding the forces and trophic interactions which have driven historic
   ecosystem dynamics. Here we used a historic (1950) food web model
   (Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE) of the NorBar Seas fitted to time series
   between 1950 and 2014 to simulate ecosystem response to changes in ocean
   temperature over the next 85 years to 2100 under a range of temperature
   scenarios including a large scale climate variability indices (Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO). Fishing, top-down/bottom-up trophic
   interactions, a primary production anomaly and annual ocean temperature
   were all found to be important drivers of modelled ecosystem dynamics in
   the NorBar Seas from 1950 to 2014. Under projected temperature
   scenarios, the biomass of pelagic species, such as mackerel and blue
   whiting, increased with rising ocean temperature, whereas the biomass of
   boreal species, such as redfish, prawns and capelin, decreased. Whilst
   within favourable temperature conditions, cod biomass is predicted to
   decrease under the warmest scenarios due to the reduced availability of
   preferred prey and the increased pressure of pelagic predation upon
   juvenile cod. The model produced by this study provides a useful
   baseline approximation of the 1950-2014 NorBar ecosystem, from which
   future research can propagate, and offers valuable insight into the
   systems potential response to changing ocean temperature. Such
   quantitative advancements are fundamental to achieve sustainable
   development in rapidly changing marine ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier

PY 2012
AB The phenomenon of geographic variation is known in practically all taxa
   of living beings. However, the reality of this phenomenon in freshwater
   molluscs (snails and bivalves) has many times been questioned in the
   past. It was accepted that these animals do not demonstrate
   spatially-oriented variation, where specific "local race" is arisen in
   each specific habitat. Till the beginning of 1970s, there was no
   statistical evidence that geographic clines in freshwater molluscs
   really exist. However, a few species of freshwater molluscs has been
   studied in this respect so far, therefore it is almost impossible to
   draw any general patterns of geographical variation in this group of
   animals. Most species of freshwater molluscs studied to the date exhibit
   statistically significant decrease of their body size in the south north
   direction. Perhaps, it may be explained by decrease of the duration of
   the growth season in high latitudes. Some species of freshwater snails
   demonstrate clinal changes in shell proportions. This allows to reject
   subspecies separation within these species since diagnostic characters
   of such "subspecies" may blur when geographic variation is taken into
   consideration. The data on geographic variation in anatomical traits in
   freshwater molluscs is much more scarce. At least one species of pond
   snails (Lymnaea terebra) demonstrates clinal variation in proportions of
   the copulative apparatus in the south - north direction. Further studies
   of geographic variation in freshwater molluscs should reveal whether it
   is truly adaptive, i.e. whether geographical clines have underlying
   genetic basis. Otherwise, the clines may arise as a result of direct
   modifying effect of a habitat.

AB Aim: We examined whether and how tree radial-growth responses to climate
   have changed for the world's southernmost conifer species throughout its
   latitudinal distribution following rapid climate change in the second
   half of the 20th century.
   LocationTemperate forests in southern South America.
   Methods: New and existing tree-ring radial growth chronologies
   representing the entire latitudinal range of Pilgerodendron uviferum
   were grouped according to latitude and then examined for differences in
   growth trends and non-stationarity in growth responses to a drought
   severity index (scPDSI) over the 1900-1993 AD period and also before and
   after significant shifts in climate in the 1950s and 1970s.
   Results: The radial-growth response of P. uviferum climate was highly
   variable across its full latitudinal distribution. There was a long-term
   and positive association between radial growth and higher moisture at
   the northern and southern edges of the distribution of this species and
   the opposite relationship for the core of its distribution, especially
   following the climatic shifts of the 1950s and 1970s. In addition,
   non-stationarity in moisture-radial growth relationships was observed in
   all three latitudinal groups (southern and northern edges and core) for
   all seasons during the 20th century.
   Main conclusions: Climate shifts in southern South America in the 1950s
   and 1970s resulted in different responses in the mean radial growth of
   P. uviferum at the southern and northern edges and at the core of its
   range. Dendroclimatic analyses document that during the first half of
   the 20th century climate-growth relationships were relatively similar
   between the southern and northern range edges but diverged after the
   1950s. Our findings imply that simulated projections of climate impacts
   on tree growth, and by implication on forest ecosystem productivity,
   derived from models of past climate-growth relationships need to
   carefully consider different and non-stationarity responses along the
   wide latitudinal distribution of this species.

AB Intact native fish assemblages-those with all or most historical taxa
   present and a strong numerical dominance of native species-are rare in
   streams and other aquatic systems worldwide. Our sampling during four
   intervals from 1983 to 2007 showed that the Purgatoire River, a Great
   Plains stream in eastern Colorado, supported an assemblage that was
   99.6% native taxa, and all but one rare species persisted through time.
   An additional rare Arkansas River native fish colonized the Purgatoire
   River and was widespread in 2006-2007, and only three nonnative taxa
   were detected. The perennial Purgatoire River supported all native
   fishes in the basin, while tributaries supported mainly native fishes
   that were tolerant of intermittent, harsh habitat. In the Purgatoire
   River, frequency and abundance of dominant species varied spatially
   during 2006-2007. Persistence of native fishes was unchanged over time
   in the Pinon Canyon reach of the river even though abundance varied
   substantially. Despite the presence of upstream Trinidad Reservoir,
   which reduced flood peak magnitude and frequency and increased base
   flows, the flow regime of the river remained flashy, with high, turbid,
   and unpredictable flood flows. Peak flows resulted from thunderstorms in
   tributaries of the Purgatoire River downstream from the reservoir or
   from snowmelt runoff and usually occurred in August or July but also
   were observed in May and June. We attribute persistence of the native
   fish assemblage to sustained base flows and, more importantly, to the
   continued (albeit lower) magnitude and frequency of peak flows and
   otherwise harsh habitat, which limit invasion by nonnative fishes from
   upstream and downstream reservoirs. Persistence of the intact native
   fish assemblage in the Purgatoire River requires maintenance of the
   dynamic flow regime and prevention of invasions by nonnative fishes,
   including riverine-adapted centrarchids like Smallmouth Bass Micropterus
   dolomieu. Conservation of the Purgatoire River basin should be a
   priority for ecologists and managers alike given its value as a study
   system and as habitat for rare fishes.

AB Global climate change can have serious direct effects on animal health
   and production through heat stress. In Hungary, the number of heat
   stress days per year (YNHD), i.e., days when the temperature humidity
   index (THI) is above a specific comfort threshold, has increased in
   recent years based on observed meteorological data. Between 1973 and
   2008, the countrywide average increase in YNHD was 4.1% per year.
   Climate scenarios based on regional climate models (RCM) were used to
   predict possible changes in YNHD for the near future (2021-2050)
   relative to the reference period (1961-1990). This comparison shows
   that, in Hungary, the 30-year mean of YNHD is expected to increase by
   between 1 and 27 days, depending on the RCM used. Half of the scenarios
   investigated in this study predicted that, in large parts of Hungary,
   YNHD will increase by at least 1 week. However, the increase observed in
   the past, and that predicted for the near future, is spatially
   heterogeneous, and areas that currently have large cattle populations
   are expected to be affected more severely than other regions.

AB Aim Climatic niche breadth (the range of climatic conditions that a
   species experiences over space and time) is a fundamental topic in
   ecology, biogeography and evolution. But what determines the climatic
   niche width of species? In 1967, Janzen suggested that climatic niche
   widths for temperature were determined by levels of seasonal fluctuation
   in temperature at each locality, such that niche breadths are narrow in
   tropical species and broad in temperate species. However, it is unclear
   whether climatic niche breadths of species are determined more by
   seasonal variability within sites as opposed to climatic variation
   between sites across the species' range. We address this question here.
   Location Global. Methods We analysed three vertebrate clades
   (plethodontid salamanders, hylid frogs and phrynosomatid lizards) for
   which we had phylogenetic information and climatic data from localities
   throughout each species' geographic range, collectively including 409
   species. We tested how climatic niche breadths of localities (i.e.
   temporal variation) are related to overall species climatic niche
   breadths (i.e. temporal and spatial variation) using phylogenetic
   comparative methods, focusing both on temperature extremes and
   precipitation. Results Across the three clades, we find that niche
   breadths for single localities generally span most of the species'
   climatic niche breadth, and are strongly correlated with overall species
   niche breadths. However, species with wider climatic niches also tend to
   show greater climatic divergence between localities. Main conclusions
   The extent to which the climatic niche breadths of species are
   determined by variation within localities versus spatial variation
   between localities has been largely unexplored. Our results suggest that
   within-locality seasonal variation explains most variation in climatic
   niche breadths among species. However, between-locality variation and
   local adaptation may also play some role. These results require more
   general testing, but have several important implications.

AB We used Swedish county-scale forest fire statistics to quantify modern
   fire activity, identify its main temporal and geographical patterns, and
   evaluate statistical performance of six fire-related weather indices as
   proxy of fire activity in Sweden over 1942-1975 and 1996-2008, the
   periods with available county-scale fire statistics. The analyzed
   indices were monthly precipitation, SPI, MDC, PDSI, calibrated PDSI, and
   DI, a Drought Index calculated as a ratio between actual and equilibrium
   evapotranspiration. The modern fire cycle (FC) in the northern part of
   Sweden varies between 2 x 10(3) and 3 x 10(4) years, whereas in southern
   Sweden the FC is somewhat shorter (10(3)-2 x 10(4) years). No temporal
   trend in average FC was evident at the country scale between the two
   periods. Significant and negative values of a Mantel test, obtained on
   county data for both periods (r=-0.494, p = 0.001 for 1942-1975 and
   r=-0.281 and p = 0.015 for 1996-2008) indicated the presence of a
   geographical pattern in annual forest fire activity. Over 1942-1975, PCA
   revealed that the central and northern counties formed one group with
   synchronized fire activity, and the southern and south-western counties
   formed another group. This pattern became less evident during the more
   recent period (1996-2008). Over 1996-2008, the analysis showed little
   synchronicity in annual fire activity across different parts of the
   country. The geographical position of a county had a clear effect on
   seasonal pattern of forest fires. In southern Sweden, the peak in the
   number of fires and the burnt area was in April-May, during a relatively
   short dry period immediately following the snowmelt. In northern Sweden,
   fires in the second half of fire season dominated the total annual area
   burnt. Analyzed indices differed considerably in their predictive power
   in respect to counties' records of annual area burnt. Calibrated PDSI
   was a superior proxy of fire activity for the southern region (R-2 =
   60.8% in regression against total annual area burnt for respective
   provinces), and Dilate (Drought Index for the first half of the growing
   season) was superior for the northern counties (R-2 = 73.3%). Predictive
   power of the indices was much higher for the recent period (1996-2002),
   with R-2 values staying within 81.2 and 97.8%. Even if modern levels of
   forest fire activity in Sweden are very low from historical perspective,
   there is a strong spatiotemporal association between fire activity and
   climatic variability at regional scales, which provides a basis for
   modeling of the future fire hazard. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   of the water body within the Dongsha (Pratas) Atoll during April
   (spring), July (summer) and October (autumn) 2011. The hydrographic
   conditions of the Dongsha Atoll were likely influenced by air
   temperature and rainfall due to the semi-enclosed topography. Surface
   water was warm and less saline, particularly in autumn, apparently due
   to the passage of Typhoon Nalgae. The highest mean (+/- s.d.) abundance
   of mesozooplankton was recorded in spring (1204 +/- 336individualsm(-3))
   and the lowest was recorded in autumn (45 +/- 9individualsm(-3)).
   Twenty-six major mesozooplankton groups were observed across the samples
   collected. Mesozooplankton communities were dominated by calanoid
   copepods, crab zoea, fish eggs and foraminiferans, which together
   comprised 86.01% of the total zooplankton catch. The absence of
   significant correlation between mesozooplankton abundance and
   chlorophyll-a concentration indicated that the temporal pattern of the
   mesozooplankton community seems to be more dependent on physical
   variables than on primary production.

AB The Puelo River is a watershed shared between Chile and Argentina with a
   mean annual streamflow of 644 m(3) s(-1). It has a high ecologic and
   economic importance, including introduced farmed salmon, tourism, sports
   fishing and projected hydroelectricity. Using Austrocedrus chilensis and
   Pilgerodendron uviferum tree-ring records we reconstructed summer-fall
   (December-May) Puelo River streamflow, which is the first of such
   reconstructions developed in the Pacific domain of South America. The
   reconstruction goes back to 1599 and has an adjusted r(2) of 0.42.
   Spectral analysis of the reconstructed streamflow shows a dominant
   84-year cycle which explains 25.1% of the total temporal variability.
   The Puelo River summer-fall streamflow shows a significant correlation
   (P > 0.95, 1943-2002) with hydrological records throughout a vast
   geographic range within the Valdivian eco-region (35 to 46 degrees S).
   Seasonal Puelo River interannual streamflow variability is related to
   large-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulation features. Summer-fall
   streamflows showed a significant negative correlation with the Antarctic
   Oscillation (AAO), whereas winter-spring anomalies appear to be
   positively connected with sea surface temperature variations in the
   tropical Pacific. In general, above- and below-average discharges in
   winter-spring are related to El Nino and La Nina events, respectively.
   The temporal patterns of the observed and reconstructed records of the
   Puelo River streamflow show a general decreasing trend in the 1943-1999
   period. Projected circulation changes for the next decades in the
   Southern Hemisphere would decrease summer-fall Puelo River streamflows
   with significant impacts on salmon production, tourism and hydropower
   generation.

   growing at the Horticulture Teaching and Research Center to determine

   their days to budbreak at all locations. Trees that had broken bud were
   more prone to late spring frost damage than trees yet to break bud.
   Species differed in chlorophyll fluorescence, bud damage, and needle
   damage after exposure to -44 degrees C. Bud, foliar, and cambium damage
   were correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence following freeze tests.
   Budbreak and midwinter cold hardiness were correlated. Species breaking
   bud earlier displayed greater midwinter cold hardiness than species
   breaking bud later. Selection criteria for future Abies introductions to

   (GAMs) to spatiotemporal fishery data from torchlight fishing
   (2009-2013) to investigate the catch rates of swordtip squid Uroteuthis
   edulis in relation to changes in oceanographic conditions within the
   southern East China Sea, and we developed a habitat preference model. A
   high Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) value is considered to be an index
   of a thermal front. The results obtained using the selected GAMs
   revealed that the explained deviance in the catch rates pertaining to
   the oceanographic conditions was 45.10% throughout the year. All
   variables examined-sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a, sea
   surface height anomaly, and JSD-were statistically significant
   predictors (P < 0.05), and JSD explained the greatest amount of deviance
   (17.70%). The model predicted relatively high abundance of swordtip
   squid at 27-28 degrees N in the southern East China Sea during spring
   and a decrease from June to August. The high abundance occurred again in
   September and extended southwestwardly to a region including coastal
   mainland China. These results demonstrated that high swordtip squid
   abundance occurred in an SST range of 20.0-26.0 degrees C and a JSD
   range of 0.35-0.50 during spring around 27-28 degrees N, and movement
   toward the southwest corresponded with shifts in the Kuroshio front (26
   degrees C isotherm) in summer and autumn.

AB Two cohorts of Loligo gahi recruit to the fishery around the Falkland
   Islands, the first in summer and the second in autumn-winter. We
   investigated factors affecting recruitment to these cohorts using 13
   years of data (1987-1999). The first evidence for density-dependent
   effects on recruitment in a squid population is reported, with very high
   spawning stock biomass leading to a reduction in recruitment in both
   cohorts. October sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with
   recruitment to the second cohort 6 months later, and a linear model
   explained 66% of the variance in recruitment strength. A model combining
   sea surface temperature and spawning stock size explained 77% of the
   variance. Thus, low October temperatures and moderate stock sizes lead
   to higher recruitment the following year than high October temperatures
   and high stock sizes. A strong negative relationship was also found
   between sea surface temperature in May and the timing of recruitment to
   the first cohort the following January-February, suggesting that higher
   temperatures lead to faster development of embryos or paralarvae and
   earlier recruitment to the fishery. A predictive model of recruitment
   size and timing should enable better management of L. gahi.

   performed on 34 samples from three sediment cores of the North Atlantic
   Ocean and the Western Mediterranean Sea (SU90-08, M39029-7 and
   MD95-2043). All three cores contain the last glacial-interglacial
   transition (marine isotopic stages 1-2), enabling us to study in detail
   the morphology of this taxon during this period of change. One hundred
   coccoliths of E huxleyi were randomly chosen in each sample; distal
   shield length and width measurements were performed on each of the
   individuals selected. The data show that E huxleyi specimens larger than
   4 mum are frequent in glacial samples and that these larger forms
   decreased sharply in abundance during the deglaciation and Holocene;
   smaller forms are more abundant in this latter group of samples. The
   decrease in larger forms seems to be time-transgressive, since it is
   recorded between 12 and 11 kyr cal. BP in southern locations (Alboran
   Sea and Gulf of Cadiz) and around 8.4 kyr cal. BP in the central North
   Atlantic. Scanning electron. microscope analyses indicated that the two
   forms have the same degree of calcification and hence this parameter
   should not be used in taxonomic classifications. We suggest that the
   larger coccoliths belong to a cold-water variety of E. huxleyi, which
   can be distinguished from the small-coccolith variety in
   light-microscope analyses by its distal shield length. The decrease in
   the abundance of this larger variety during the deglaciation period
   could be used as a biostratigraphic event in the North Atlantic and
   Mediterranean areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecologists are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental
   variability in natural systems. Climate change is affecting both the
   mean and the variability in weather and, in particular, the effect of
   changes in variability is poorly understood. Organisms are subject to
   selection imposed by both the mean and the range of environmental
   variation experienced by their ancestors. Changes in the variability in
   a critical environmental factor may therefore have consequences for
   vital rates and population dynamics. Here, we examine =90-year trends in
   different components of climate (precipitation mean and coefficient of
   variation (CV); temperature mean, seasonal amplitude and residual
   variance) and consider the effects of these components on survival and
   recruitment in a population of Eurasian beavers (n similar to=similar to
   242) over 13 recent years. Within climatic data, no trends in
   precipitation were detected, but trends in all components of temperature
   were observed, with mean and residual variance increasing and seasonal
   amplitude decreasing over time. A higher survival rate was linked (in
   order of influence based on Akaike weights) to lower precipitation CV
   (kits, juveniles and dominant adults), lower residual variance of
   temperature (dominant adults) and lower mean precipitation (kits and
   juveniles). No significant effects were found on the survival of
   nondominant adults, although the sample size for this category was low.
   Greater recruitment was linked (in order of influence) to higher
   seasonal amplitude of temperature, lower mean precipitation, lower
   residual variance in temperature and higher precipitation CV. Both
   climate means and variance, thus proved significant to population
   dynamics; although, overall, components describing variance were more

AB There is no single instrument that can sample quantitatively the
   complete spectrum of pelagic organisms, or even all the components of
   zooplankton. Mesh size is the main factor affecting species selectivity
   in the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), implying a need to use
   multiple net systems to fully characterize a community. The spatial
   distribution of copepod communities in the water masses of the western
   and eastern sectors of Drake Passage were studied using, respectively, a
   CPR and a Pump Net onboard system. For this purpose, and assuming that
   copepod community size structures of each of the three water masses were
   similar in both the sectors studied, the possibility of complementing
   CPR results using a Pump-Net onboard system was evaluated. The latter
   system allows the estimation of absolute abundances and has the
   advantage of solving two problems associated with CPR, namely mesh
   clogging and low catching efficiency. The contribution of the nauplius
   forms and species accurately identified with both samplers was analyzed.
   Although Oithona similis dominated both communities, in the western
   sector small species made a greater contribution than Calanus
   simillimus, the opposite being true for the eastern sector. Nauplii and
   early copepodite stages of O. similis were missing from the CPR samples
   and represented between 69 and 79% of total copepod communities, whereas
   small calanoid copepods, C. simillimus copepodites and later stages of
   O. similis were inaccurately sampled by the CPR and represented between
   14 and 18% of the copepod community. Hence, the Pump Net sampler is
   useful for complementing the semi-quantitative information of the CPR
   and for its calibration.

AB The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, was collected during 2004
   from two tropical lagoons (1 - Laguna Tamiahua; Tantalamos, LT-1 and La
   Dalia, LT-2; and 2 Laguna Grande; Vega de Alatorre, LG) in the Gulf of
   Mexico to document sexual and reproductive changes. Evolution of oocyte
   cohorts was described by analyzing frequency distributions of oocyte
   diameters and sex ratios. Each population (LT-1, LT-2, and LG) showed a
   distinct pattern in the number of cohorts, eight at LT-1 and LG, and
   five at LT-2. The main reproductive period was January through September
   with continuous spawning events and peaks in March and July. From modal
   analysis, oysters at LT-1 and LG, sites with a mean annual temperature
   >27 degrees C, produced oocytes at a rate three times faster than
   oysters at LT-2, a site with a lower mean annual temperature. This
   suggests, apart from differences in spawning intensity among sites, a
   threshold temperature to attain maximum reproductive activity. Energy
   reserves were stored during lower temperatures, and it appears that the
   reserves are used later for gametogenesis. Higher frequency of
   hermaphrodites occurred throughout the reproduction cycle, suggesting
   continuous changes of sex from male to female, likely to be a
   reproductive strategy to maintain high rates of gametogenesis. These
   findings provide a better understanding of the reproductive biology of
   C. virginica in tropical areas.

AB Ectotherms are known to function optimally within a specific range of
   body temperatures, bordered by two setpoint values (i.e. preferred
   temperature range; T-p). Preferred body temperature stands central in
   understanding behavioural thermoregulation in a thermally dynamic
   temperate environment. In this study we determined T-p for the
   group-living cordylid lizard, Ouroborus cataphractus, during the
   respective annual peak periods in food availability and scarcity. Body
   temperatures were recorded in ecologically realistic photo-thermal
   gradients using body-mounted, modified iButtons. In addition to studying
   seasonal and spatial variation in T-p we also assessed daily variation
   and among-day repeatability of T-p estimates. The mean T-p among
   populations and across seasons was 29.8 +/- 2.3 degrees C (range:
   26.8-32.6 degrees C) and represents the lowest mean T-p and range
   recorded for any cordylid lizard to date. Literature reports on the
   seasonal activity patterns and micro-spatial variation in thermal
   habitat quality of O. cataphractus suggest that the low T-p minimizes
   thermoregulatory costs during summer, autumn, late winter and spring.
   The low T-p is therefore expected to relax energy budgets and function
   as part of the adaptive strategy of the species to survive seasonal food
   stress in a semi-arid environment. The among-day repeatability of mean
   T-p varied among populations and across seasons despite exposure
   conditions that were kept constant. The results of the present study
   suggest that T-p estimates based on short term laboratory trials may be
   inaccurate due to potential high among-day individual variation and low
   repeatability in thermal preference.

   Antarctic, chiefly in maritime areas with permanent snow cover for
   several months of each year. Here, we review the environments inhabited
   by polar snow moulds, their distribution and the macroscopic features of
   infections, such as the sclerotia that form on the leaves of higher
   plants, or the more frequently encountered concentric rings found in
   moss stands. The microscopic features of infections are described, as
   are the taxa of snow moulds found in polar habitats, such as the
   ascomycetes Thyronectria antarctica var. hyperantarctica and Sclerotinia
   borealis, the basidiomycete Typhula ishikariensis and the oomycete
   Pythium. Recent research, also reviewed here, indicates that a
   heterothallic species of Pythium apparently has a bipolar distribution.
   The adaptations of snow moulds to polar environments, such as their
   growth at low temperatures, are covered, as are avenues for future
   research on these microbes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British

AB We analyzed growth responses to climate of 24 tree-ring width and four
   maximum latewood density chronologies from the greater Tatra region in
   Poland and Slovakia. This network comprises 1183 ring-width and 153
   density measurement series from four conifer species (Picea abies (L.)
   Karst., Larix decidua Mill., Abies alba (L.) Karst., and Pinus mugo
   (L.)) between 800 and 1550 m a.s.l. Individual spline detrending was
   used to retain annual to multi-decadal scale climate information in the
   data. Twentieth century temperature and precipitation data frorn 16
   grid-boxes covering the 48-50 degrees N and 19-21 degrees E region were
   used for comparison. The network was analyzed to assess growth responses
   to climate as a function of species, elevation, parameter, frequency and
   site ecology. Twenty ring-width chronologies significantly correlated (P
   < 0.05) with June-July temperatures, whereas the latewood density
   chronologies were correlated with the April-September temperatures.
   Climatic effects of the previous-year summer generally did not
   significantly influence ring formation, whereas site elevation and
   frequency of growth variations (i.e., inter-annual and decadal) were
   significant variables in explaining growth response to climate. Response
   to precipitation increased with decreasing elevation. Correlations
   between summer temperatures and annual growth rates were lower for Larix
   decidua than for Picea abies. Principal component analysis identified
   five dominant eigenvectors that express somewhat contrasting climatic
   signals. The first principal component contained highest loadings from I
   I Picea abies ring-width chronologies and one Pinus mugo ring-width
   chronology and explained 42% of the network's variance. The mean of
   these 12 high-elevation chronologies was significantly correlated at
   0.62 with June-July temperatures, whereas the mean of three latewood
   density chronologies, which loaded most strongly on the fourth principal
   component, significantly correlated at 0.69 with April-September
   temperatures (P < 0.001 over the 1901-2002 period in both cases). These
   groupings allow for a robust estimation of June-July (1661-2004) and
   April-September (1709-2004) temperatures, respectively. Comparison with
   reconstructions from the Alps and Central Europe supports the general
   rule of the dominant influence of growing season temperature on
   high-elevation forest growth.

AB Examining the co-occurrence of taxonomically similar species can provide
   important information about their niches and coexistence. Segregation at
   smaller scales can be especially relevant for grazers living at the edge
   of their geographic distribution, because environmental factors can lead
   to similar distribution. Related grazer species may show dispersive,
   i.e. uniform, distribution at small scales (few centimetres) to reduce
   interference among individuals. We examined intra-and interspecific
   spatial distribution and habitat use in 2 phylogenetically related
   intertidal limpets, Scurria viridula and S. zebrina, at the polar and
   equatorial edge of their geographic distribution, respectively, and in
   S. araucana, a widely distributed species that overlaps the range of the
   other 2 species across the southeastern Pacific. S. viridula and S.
   zebrina overlapped in a narrow geographic zone (ca. 250 km) and reached
   relatively similar densities and sizes. Intraspecific spatial structure
   estimated through autocorrelation and individual-to-individual distances
   was random for S. viridula and variable for S. zebrina and S. araucana,
   depending on the scale considered; S. zebrina was aggregated at the
   individual-to-individual distances, while S. araucana was mostly random
   at this scale. Segregated distribution between S. viridula and S.
   zebrina was observed at the finer scale, whereas the association with S.
   araucana was random. Abundance of limpets loosely followed major
   habitats, namely bare rock and the alga Mazzaella laminarioides, which
   showed patchy distributions. We suggests that similarity in population
   traits between S. viridula and S. zebrina found in the overlap zone may
   be compensated by small-scale spatial segregation. Thus, at the edge of
   their geographic distribution, co existence between related species may
   be influenced by spatial niche differentiation driven by habitat
   suitability or competition.

AB Changing climate in the Arctic is expected to have significant effects
   on the pattern and distribution of terrestrial vegetation. Species
   characteristic of specific zones in the mountains of northern Sweden
   have been shown to migrate up- and down-slope with changes in climate
   over the Holocene. This study evaluates the potential for Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.) to become a treeline dominant at Fennoscandian
   treelines, replacing mountain birch (Betula pubescens subsp.
   czerepanovii (Orlova) Hamet-Ahti). Data from paired mountain birch and
   Scots pine tree-ring chronologies for eight locations in northern Sweden
   are used to develop climate - tree ring width index (RWI) relationships.
   Modeled climate-RWI relationships are then used to predict the relative
   RWI values of the two species under a suite of climate-forcing scenarios
   using an ensemble of three global climate models. Results indicate that
   mountain birch and Scots pine RWI are both correlated with summer
   temperatures, but Scots pine is more likely than mountain birch to be
   influenced by moisture conditions. Predictions of RWI under future
   climate conditions indicate that mountain birch is unlikely to be
   replaced by Scots pine within the next century.

AB A number of researchers have applied multivariate methods to elucidate
   the population structure of fishes. In this study, we also used
   multivariate techniques to examine meristic and morphological variations
   in the silver perch, Leiopotherapon plumbeus (Kner, 1864), from three
   Philippine lakes, namely, Laguna de Bay, Sampaloc Lake, and Taal Lake.
   We also aimed to determine whether or not there are meristic and
   morphological differences among the populations of silver perch from the
   three lakes, considering that this fish species was introduced from
   Laguna de Bay into Sampaloc Lake and Taal Lake in the late 1950s and
   early 1970s, respectively. A total of 710 specimens from four different
   sites were used in the study: 155 each from Binangonan and Tanay areas
   of Laguna de Bay and 200 each from Sampaloc Lake and Taal Lake. Based on
   analysis of variance, eight meristic and 26 transformed morphometric
   characters were selected for subsequent analyses. Nineteen (19)
   principal components extracted from the 34 significant variables
   accounted for 82.3% of the variation in the original variables. Factor
   analysis using varimax rotation produced four factors: factor 1 was
   dominated by fin measurements while the highest loadings for factor 2
   were gill raker counts. Factors 3 and 4 were dominated by various body
   and head measurements. Cluster analysis showed specimens from Sampaloc
   Lake and Taal Lake in one group, while majority of the specimens from
   Binangonan and Tanay are in another cluster. This suggests a closer
   morphological similarity between specimens from Sampaloc and Taal.
   Discriminant analysis gave relatively high correct classification rates
   (76.13-95.50%). Lower gill raker count was the most discriminating
   variable. Since both the silver perch from Sampaloc Lake and Taal Lake
   were introduced from Laguna de Bay, the observed clustering and
   morphological variation could be attributed to similarities and
   differences in the lake environments. Laguna de Bay is a shallow
   eutrophic lake, while Sampaloc Lake and Taal Lake are deep lakes.
   Further studies, however, are needed to determine which of the myriad of
   biological and/or physico-chemical factors might have the greatest
   influence on the observed morphological divergence between the source
   population and transplanted populations that we found in our study.

AB El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of
   inter-annual variability operating in the earth's climate system with
   enormous ecological, social, and economic impacts. As the instrumental
   record of ENSO variability is limited to the past 150 yr, the search for
   proxies sensitive to ENSO has become a priority task in recent years. It
   is vital to expand the sparse network of annually resolved and exactly
   dated ENSO-sensitive proxies to entirely capture the spatial variability
   of the ENSO coupled ocean-atmospheric phenomenon. Several tree-ring
   records have been used to reconstruct past ENSO variability, however,
   none of them are from tropical South America. The Polylepis tarapacana
   woodlands form the world's highest elevation treeline. Trees grow on the
   Altiplano plateau between 4000-5200 m elevation (16 degrees-23 degrees
   S). The climate variability in this climatically transitional
   tropical-subtropical region is strongly modulated by ENSO. Two
   chronologies of P. tarapacana along the Western Cordillera in the
   tropical central Andes were analyzed to determine the strength of the
   ENSO signal present in these tree-ring records.
   The growth of P. tarapacana has a strong common signal amongst trees in
   a single site and between sites across the Altiplano. Ring formation is
   induced by climatic conditions during the previous and current growing
   season (December-February), at the time of the strongest ENSO influences
   on the Peruvian Coast. Tree growth variations show opposite
   relationships with climate between consecutive growing seasons. During
   the current growing season, ring-width variations show positive and
   negative relationships with temperature and precipitation, respectively.
   Both tree-ring chronologies are significantly correlated with austral
   spring-summer (August-February) SST in the Nino3.4 region and show
   oscillatory modes within the classical ENSO bandwidth. Our results
   support the idea that P. tarapacana chronologies from the south-central
   tropical Andes provide high-resolution records extremely sensitive to
   ENSO in the tropical Pacific, and represent an important component to be
   considered in future multiproxy ENSO reconstructions. (C) 2008 Elsevier

   questions. We do so by demonstrating, for each of the MA drivers, how a
   macrophysiological approach can or has helped elucidate the impacts of
   these drivers and their interactions. Moreover, we illustrate that a
   large-scale physiological perspective can provide insights into
   previously unrecognized threats to diversity, such as the erosion of
   physiological variation and stress tolerance, which are a consequence of
   the removal of large species and individuals from the biosphere. In so
   doing we demonstrate that environmental physiologists have much to offer

   family level and above, raising questions about the broader
   applicability of this work to other taxa. Here we investigate resistance
   to high and low temperatures, following different temperature
   treatments, in ten species and 31 populations of weevils found on
   sub-Antaretic Heard Island and Marion Island, which have substantially
   different climates. In these weevils there is considerable interspecific
   and among-population variation in critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and
   critical thermal maximum (CTmax), but most of this variation in critical
   limits can be ascribed to phenotypic plasticity. We find no relationship
   between CTmin and CTmax at the species level, and this is true also of
   populations and of responses to the temperature treatments. In general,
   plastic (acclimation) changes in CTmin are larger than those in CTmax.
   Our data therefore provide support for the idea that resistance to heat
   and to cold are decoupled in terrestrial arthropods. Furthermore, our
   results suggest that investigations of physiological limits to species
   borders should incorporate the effects of phenotypic plasticity on
   physiological capabilities. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The oceanographic conditions that could influence richness and
   distribution of marine mammal species in the coastal area of the Mexican
   Central Pacific (MCP) were investigated throughout 2011. Marine mammals
   observations were obtained from two research platforms. CTD casts were
   deployed down to 100 m, water samples were taken monthly at six stations
   for determination of organic nutrients, and another 15 stations were
   sampled over a wider area only during the winter. Satellite images from
   MODIS-AQUA L2 were used to obtain sea surface temperature (SST) and
   chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) values, likewise altimetry data to
   identify mesoscale dynamic structures in the region. High salinity
   values (34.6), low concentrations of nitrates and nitrites ((similar
   to)3-4 mu M), silicates (5-7 mu M), Chl-alpha ((similar to)10 mg m(-3)),
   and low SST ((similar to)23.5 degrees C) were detected, as well as the
   presence of cyclonic gyres near the coast during the winter-spring
   period. This coincided with high marine mammal species richness in the
   area (from 5 to 9 species depending on spatial scale). The dominant
   species was Megaptera novaeangliae (0.092 sightings km(-1)), which was
   distributed close to the coast in shallow waters. Low salinity (32.8)
   and Chl-alpha values (0.1 mg m(-3)) were detected during the summer-fall
   period. High phosphate availability (2.5 mu M), presence of anticyclonic
   gyres, and high SST ((similar to)31 degrees C) were also found,
   coinciding with low species richness (3 species). The dominant species
   was Stenella attenuata (0.036 sightings km(-1)); those individuals were
   found distributed near the Jalisco-Colima coast (0-3 nm) in shallow
   waters with high inorganic nutrient availability. The principal
   components analysis showed that bathymetry (99.6%) was the main
   parameter explaining data variance; this parameter could therefore
   potentially modulate ecological aspects of marine mammals.

AB The productivity of arid environments and the reproductive success of
   vertebrates in these systems, are typically thought to be primarily
   influenced by rainfall patterns. Data from our 15 year study at an
   Australian arid zone site reveals asynchronous demographic responses to
   rainfall and other climatic variables among different lizard species. We
   show that, in addition to precipitation, key demographic rates
   (fecundity, recruitment and survival) are correlated strongly with
   temporal variability in temperature, during and prior to the breeding
   season, and also to the density of sympatric lizard species. There were
   nine-fold fluctuations through time in the relative abundance of two
   similar-sized Ctenotus species, and asynchronous recruitment success and
   survival among other species, despite the absence of direct
   anthropogenic affects Understanding the drivers and magnitude of the
   substantial natural variability in arid-zone lizard assemblages is

AB The current rate of warming due to increases in greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions is very likely unprecedented over the last 10,000 y. Although
   the majority of countries have adopted the view that global warming must
   be limited to <2 degrees C, current GHG emission rates and nonagreement
   at Copenhagen in December 2009 increase the likelihood of this limit
   being exceeded by 2100. Extensive evidence has linked major changes in
   biological systems to 20th century warming. The "Global 200" comprises
   238 ecoregions of exceptional biodiversity [Olson DM, Dinerstein E
   (2002) Ann Mo Bot Gard 89:199-224]. We assess the likelihood that, by
   2070, these iconic ecoregions will regularly experience monthly climatic
   conditions that were extreme in 1961-1990. Using >600 realizations from
   climate model ensembles, we show that up to 86% of terrestrial and 83%
   of freshwater ecoregions will be exposed to average monthly temperature
   patterns >2 SDs (2 sigma) of the 1961-1990 baseline, including 82% of
   critically endangered ecoregions. The entire range of 89 ecoregions will
   experience extreme monthly temperatures with a local warming of <2
   degrees C. Tropical and subtropical ecoregions, and mangroves, face
   extreme conditions earliest, some with <1 degrees C warming. In
   contrast, few ecoregions within Boreal Forests and Tundra biomes will
   experience such extremes this century. On average, precipitation regimes
   do not exceed 2s of the baseline period, although considerable
   variability exists across the climate realizations. Further, the
   strength of the correlation between seasonal temperature and
   precipitation changes over numerous ecoregions. These results suggest
   many Global 200 ecoregions may be under substantial climatic stress by
   2100.

AB Seaweed assemblages in Atlantic Europe are been distorted by global
   change, but the intricate coastal profile of the area suggests that
   susceptibility may differ between regions. In particular, NW Iberia is
   an important omission because no study has systematically assessed
   long-term changes in a large number of species. Using intertidal surveys
   for 33 common perennial seaweeds, we show that the average number of
   species per site declined significantly from 1998-99 to 2014 in NW
   Iberia. The largest drops in site occupancy were detected in kelps,
   fucoids, and carrageenan-producing Rhodophyta. Parallel analyses
   revealed significant upward trends in SST, air temperature, and strong
   waves; meanwhile, nutrients decreased slightly except in areas affected
   by local inputs. Similar changes reported for subtidal assemblages in
   other parts of Atlantic Europe suggest that the drivers may be
   ubiquitous. Nonetheless, a more proper assessment of both global and
   local impacts, will require further surveys, and the regular monitoring
   of intertidal perennial seaweeds appears as a cost-effective alternative
   to discriminate genuine long-term trends from transitory fluctuations.

AB One challenge for statisticians and epidemiologists in projecting the
   future health risks of climate change is how to estimate
   exposure-response relationships when temperatures are higher than at
   present. Low dose extrapolation has been an area of rich study,
   resulting in well-defined methods and best practices. A primary
   difference between high dose and low dose extrapolation of
   exposure-response relationships is that low dose extrapolation is
   bounded at no exposure and no (or a baseline) response. With climate
   change altering weather variables and their variability beyond
   historical values, the highest future exposures in a region are
   projected to be higher than current experience. Modelers of the health
   risks of high temperatures are making assumptions about human responses
   associated with exposures outside the range of their data; these
   assumptions significantly affect the magnitude of projected future
   risks. Further, projections are affected by adaptation assumptions; we
   explore no adaptation (extrapolated response); individual
   (physiological) adaptation; and community adaptation. We present an
   example suggesting that linear models can make poor predictions of
   observations when no adaptation is assumed. Assumptions of the effects
   of weather above what has been observed needs to be more transparent in
   future studies. Statistical simulation studies could guide public health
   researchers in identifying best practices and reducing bias in
   projecting risks associated with extreme temperatures. Epidemiological
   studies should evaluate the extent and time required for adaptation, as
   well as the benefits of public health interventions.

AB The seasonal succession of phytoplankton communities in turloughs
   (seasonal karstic Irish lakes) is described for the first time.
   R-selected species dominated throughout the duration of flooding and a
   clear succession of communities, with three distinct phases, was found
   in most turloughs: prevalence of Chlamydomonas, cryptophytes, pennate
   diatoms and Tribonema in the first few months of flooding followed by
   dominance in winter by cryptophytes, pennate diatoms and centric
   diatoms. A final stage in late spring was characterized by filamentous
   greens and chrysophytes. Algal communities in turloughs resemble those
   of ponds, lakes or even slow-flowing rivers, depending on the time of
   the year. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables significantly
   affecting phytoplankton composition in turloughs were total phosphorus
   (TP), season and mean depth/colour. Turloughs with higher TP tended to
   have a higher prevalence of green algae, particularly filamentous forms.
   Tychoplanktonic algae were also important in turloughs (up to 82% of
   total biovolume), probably owing to their shallow nature and to the
   presence of terrestrial vegetation on the bottom of the basins. The
   results are discussed in relation to Reynolds functional groups and
   other studies and, in general, it is shown that there is good accordance
   between the algae found in turloughs and what is presently known of
   their ecologies.

AB Climate change involves alterations in seasonality as well as shifts in
   mean annual temperature. Cold temperate lakes show strong seasonality,
   with winter ice cover and alternating mixing and stratification periods
   during the ice-free season. These physical changes are ultimately
   related to seasonal weather variation and also drive annual
   phytoplankton succession. Therefore, phytoplankton remains in lake
   sediment records are potentially useful for reconstructing past seasonal
   climate signals. With the exception of investigations on varved
   sediments, however, little research has been carried out on the subject.
   Here we present two lines of evidence demonstrating that chrysophyte
   stomatocysts can be useful for inferring past climatic seasonality.
   First, we show that marked seasonal stomatocyst replacement is related
   to periods of the main physical processes in the lake. Second, using
   instrumental climate data and microfossils in sediment cores, we show
   that two main components of stomatocyst variability over the last
   similar to 150 years are related to seasonal fluctuations. The first of
   these components is related to stomatocysts present during summer
   stratification that respond to general warming trends, particularly in
   July and August. The second component relates to stomatocysts typically
   present in the spring and autumn mixing periods. Numbers of these two
   stomatocyst types vary inversely in response to variation in spring
   (April-May) temperatures. The number of stomatocyst types affected by
   spring temperatures is much greater than those related to summer
   temperatures. We provide evidence that chrysophyte stomatocysts are an
   excellent proxy for spring air temperature reconstructions, with little
   influence from summer or general annual trends. We also show that with
   relatively little effort, it is possible to categorise the chrysophyte
   stomatocyst assemblage of a lake to carry out detailed investigation of
   the record of seasonal changes preserved within the sediment.

AB Large-scale coral bleaching was first observed in 1979 and has occurred
   throughout virtually all of the tropics since that time. Severe
   bleaching may result in the loss of live coral and in a decline of the
   integrity of the impacted coral reef ecosystem. Despite the extensive
   scientific research and increased public awareness of coral bleaching,
   uncertainties remain about the past and future of large-scale coral
   bleaching. In order to reduce these uncertainties and place large-scale
   coral bleaching in the longer-term climatological context, specific
   criteria and methods for using historical sea surface temperature (SST)
   data to examine coral bleaching-related thermal conditions are proposed
   by analyzing three, 132 year SST reconstructions: ERSST, HadISST1, and
   GISST2.3b. These methodologies are applied to case studies at Discovery
   Bay, Jamaica (77.27 degrees W, 18.45 degrees N), Sombrero Reef, Florida,
   USA (81.11 degrees W, 24.63 degrees N), Academy Bay, Galapagos, Ecuador
   (90.31 degrees W, 0.74 degrees S), Pearl and Hermes Reef, Northwest

   Australia (147.68 degrees E, 18.83 degrees S), and North Male Atoll,
   Maldives (73.35 degrees E, 4.70 degrees N). The results of this study
   show that (1) The historical SST data provide a useful long-term record
   of thermal conditions in reef ecosystems, giving important insight into
   the thermal history of coral reefs and (2) While coral bleaching and
   anomalously warm SSTs have occurred over much of the world in recent
   decades, case studies in the Caribbean, Northwest Hawaiian Islands, and
   parts of other regions such as the Great Barrier Reef exhibited SST
   conditions and cumulative thermal stress prior to 1979 that were
   comparable to those conditions observed during the strong, frequent
   coral bleaching events since 1979. This climatological context and
   knowledge of past environmental conditions in reef ecosystems may foster
   a better understanding of how coral reefs will respond in future, ocean

   Atlantic chub mackerel in the Portuguese waters and the Spanish waters
   of the Gulf of Cadiz using data from acoustic surveys from 1995 to 2010
   and data from the fishery since 1958. The distribution and dynamics of
   chub mackerel and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are compared and species
   interactions are discussed. From 2007 to 2009, chub mackerel biomass, as
   measured acoustically, ranged between 69000 and 238000 t concentrated
   off the western coast (similar to 50%) and in the Gulf of Cadiz (similar
   to 30%). Portuguese landings have varied with periods of high landings
   around 1970 and in recent years. Since 1986 landings have been between
   4000 and 23000 t. Both survey catches and commercial landings are taken
   mainly off the southwestern coast and one- to two-year-old individuals
   (20-24 cm) predominate in both. Scarcity of larger individuals may be a
   consequence of their deeper distribution and avoidance of fishing gear,
   migration of older individuals or a combination of both. In years with
   high abundance, the fishery expands to the northwestern areas of the
   Iberian Peninsula. The expansion appears to be caused by improved
   recruitment although other factors might have contributed (such as
   targeting to compensate for low sardine catches and the appearance of
   new markets). The complementary spatial distribution of chub mackerel
   and sardine and the inverse correlations between their frequency of
   occurrence, landings and recruitment indices suggest some interaction
   between the dynamics of the two species, possibly associated with
   climatic variation.

AB The ability of corals to cope with environmental change, such as
   increased temperature, relies on the physiological mechanisms of
   acclimatisation and long-term genetic adaptation. We experimentally
   examined the bleaching sensitivity exhibited by 2 species of coral,
   Pocillopora damicornis and Turbinaria reniformis, at 3 locations across
   a latitudinal gradient of almost 6 degrees on the Great Barrier Reef
   (GBR), Target bleaching temperature was reached by using a ramping rate
   of 0.2 degrees C/h. We found that the bleaching sensitivity and recovery
   of both species differed between corals with clade D symbionts and those
   with clade C. However, in F damicornis bleaching susceptibility
   corresponded more strongly with latitude than with zooxanthella type and
   hence, temperature history, suggesting that local adaptation has
   occurred. The observed bleaching sensitivity was shown by a decrease in
   photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) in both species of coral. The rate of
   recovery in T reniformis was highest in explants containing clade D
   symbionts. The occurrence of clade D in the northern section of the GBR
   may reflect a long-term response to high sea water temperatures, while
   the presence of clade D in low abundance in T reniformis at Heralds
   Prong Reef and Percy Island may be a result of recent bleaching events.

AB In fewer than two decades after invading the Americas, the fly
   Drosophila subobscura evolved latitudinal clines for chromosomal
   inversion frequencies and wing size that are parallel to the
   long-standing ones in native Palearctic populations. By sharp contrast,
   wing shape clines also evolved in the New World, but the relationship
   with latitude was opposite to that in the Old World. Previous work has
   suggested that wing trait differences among individuals are partially
   due to the association between chromosomal inversions and particular
   alleles which influence the trait under consideration. Furthermore, it
   is well documented that a few number of effective individuals founded
   the New World populations, which might have modified the biometrical
   effect of inversions on quantitative traits. Here we evaluate the
   relative contribution of chromosomal inversion clines in shaping the
   parallel clines in wing size and contrasting clines in wing shape in
   native and colonizing populations of the species. Our results reveal
   that inversion-size and inversion-shape associations in native and
   colonizing (South America) populations are generally different, probably
   due to the bottleneck effect. Contingent, unpredictable evolution was
   suggested as an explanation for the different details involved in the
   otherwise parallel wing size clines between Old and New World
   populations of D. subobscura. We challenge this assertion and conclude
   that contrasting wing shape clines came out as a correlated response of
   inversion clines that might have been predicted considering the genetic
   background of colonizers.

AB We use pollen, stomata and plant-macrofossil records to infer Holocene
   timberline fluctuations and changes in forest composition at Lac
   Superieur de Fully (2 135 in a.s.l.), a small lake located near the
   modern regional timberline on a highland plateau in the Central Alps.
   Our records suggest that during the early Holocene vegetation was rather
   open on the plateau (eg, heaths of Dryas octopetala, Juniperus nana).
   The only tree that was able to build major stands was Belula. Other
   timberline trees (eg, Pinus cembra and Larix) expanded in the catchment
   of the lake after 8200 cal. BP, when Abies alha expanded at lower
   elevation. The late appearance of these timberline trees contrasts with
   previous plant-macrofossil records in the region, which show that the
   timberline had reached elevations up to at least 2350 in already at I
   1000 cal. BP. We suggest that local climatic conditions may have delayed
   the expansion of closed stands of coniferous trees in the catchment of
   Lac de Fully until C. 8200 cal. BP, when climate shifted to more humid
   and less continental conditions. After c. 4600 cal. BP vegetation around
   the lake primarily responded to human impact, which caused a local
   lowering of the timberline by at least 150 in.

AB Plasticity in wing characters was investigated in lines selected for

   at 25 degrees C. All lines were raised across a temperature range from
   17.5 degrees C to 27.5 degrees C after several generations of
   directional selection. We tested whether correlated responses in wing
   cell size and cell number and in plasticity occurred as a result of
   selection on wing size or thorax size. A difference in plasticity in the
   lines was observed at different selection temperatures. Selection at 25
   degrees C resulted only in a change in mean values, whereas selection at
   20 degrees C led to some correlated responses in plasticity. Different
   results might have been obtained if more replicates of the selection
   lines had been started from the same population. The results show that
   mean size at a temperature and plasticity across temperatures are at
   least partly determined by different genes.

AB The Mediterranean stone pine, Pinus pinea L., seems to be well adapted
   to the different climate zones of its distribution range that spans four
   thousand kilometres along the Northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
   But recent molecular studies revealed it to be extremely genetically
   depauperate for a widespread tree. In this context, a provenances trial
   should elucidate whether any differentiation in adaptative traits can be
   identified between 34 accessions covering its natural range. The
   presence of strong spatial autocorrelations throughout four test sites
   required iterative nearest-neighbours adjustments in their statistical
   analysis. No significant differences in survival or ontogeny were found
   between accessions, while height growth was slightly though
   significantly more vigorous in northern or inland provenances. But these
   differences were masked by a common, stable reaction norm in dependence
   on site and microsite. On the other hand, its strong developmental
   plasticity allows the stone pine to delay the heteroblastic phase change
   in order to survive in unfavourable conditions, a clear advantage in the
   limiting and unpredictable environments of Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB This paper outlines the different methods which may be used for the
   construction of regional climate change scenarios. The main focus of the
   paper is the construction of regional climate change scenarios from
   climate change experiments carried out using General Circulation Models
   (GCMs). An introduction to some GCM climate change experiments
   highlights the difference between model types and experiments (e.g.
   equilibrium or transient). The latest generation of climate change
   experiments have been performed using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere
   GCMs. These allow transient simulations of climate change to be
   performed with respect to a given greenhouse gas forcing scenario. There
   are, however, a number of problems with these simulations which pose
   difficulties for the construction of climate change scenarios for use in
   climate change impacts assessment.
   The characteristics of the transient climate change experiments which
   pose difficulties for the construction of climate change scenarios are
   discussed. Three examples of these problems are: different climate
   change experiments use different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios;
   the ''cold-start'' problem which makes it hard to link future
   projections of climate change a given calendar year; and the drift of
   the climate is noticeable in the control simulations. In order to
   construct climate change scenarios for impacts assessment a method has
   therefore to be employed which addresses these problems.
   At present the climate modelling and climate change impacts communities
   are somewhat polarised in their approach to spatial scales. Current GCMs
   model the climate at resolutions larger than 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees,
   while the majority of impacts assessment studies are undertaken at
   scales below 50 km (or 0.5 degrees). This paper concludes by addressing
   the problems in bringing together these two different modelling
   perspectives by presenting a number of regional climate change
   scenarios.

AB Paleoclimate reconstruction on the Common Era (1-2000 AD) provides
   critical context for recent warming trends. This work leverages
   integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to conduct inference
   under a Bayesian hierarchical model using data from three sources: a
   state-of-the-art proxy database (PAGES 2k), surface temperature
   observations (HadCRUT4), and latest estimates of external forcings.
   INLA's computational efficiency allows to explore several model
   formulations (with or without forcings, explicitly modeling internal
   variability or not), as well as five data reduction techniques. Two
   different validation exercises find a small impact of data reduction
   choices, but a large impact for model choice, with best results for the
   two models that incorporate external forcings. These models confirm that
   man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the largest contributor to
   temperature variability over the Common Era, followed by volcanic
   forcing. Solar effects are indistinguishable from zero. INLA provide an
   efficient way to estimate the posterior mean, comparable with the much
   costlier Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure, but with wider uncertainty
   bounds. We recommend using it for exploration of model designs, but full
   MCMC solutions should be used for proper uncertainty quantification.
   Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

AB Extreme events have profound ecological impacts on species and
   ecosystems, including range contractions and collapse of entire
   ecosystems. Although theory predicts that extreme events cause loss of
   genetic diversity, empirical demonstrations are rare, obscuring
   implications for future adaptive capacity of species and populations.
   Here, we use rare genetic data from before an extreme event to
   empirically demonstrate massive and cryptic loss of genetic diversity
   across similar to 800 km of underwater forests following the most severe
   marine heatwave on record. Two forest-forming seaweeds (Sargassum fallax
   and Scytothalia dorycarpa) lost similar to 30%-65% of average genetic
   diversity within the 800-km footprint of the heatwave and up to 100% of
   diversity at some sites. Populations became dominated by single
   haplotypes that were often not dominant or present prior to the
   heatwave. Strikingly, these impacts were cryptic and not reflected in
   measures of forest cover used to determine ecological impact of the
   heatwave. Our results show that marine heatwaves can drive strong loss
   of genetic diversity, which may compromise adaptability to future
   climatic change.

   productivity. Modulation of intrinsic photosynthetic capacity matches
   investment in photosynthetic components to opportunity for CO2 uptake
   and productivity in specific environments, with exceptionally high rates
   during particularly narrow windows of opportunity. Response varies among
   species and ecotypes and should be evaluated on multiple reference bases
   as well as chloroplast, leaf, and whole plant scales. Photosynthetic
   capacity, total foliar vascular transport capacity, and plant sink
   strength are modulated in concert. Switching among alternative target

AB The identification of protein binding sites in promoter sequences is a
   key problem to understand and control regulation in biochemistry and
   biotechnological processes. We use a computational method to analyze
   promoters from a given genome. Our approach is based on a physical model
   at the mesoscopic level of protein-DNA interaction based on the
   influence of DNA local conformation on the dynamics of a general
   particle along the chain. Following the proposed model, the joined
   dynamics of the protein particle and the DNA portion of interest, only
   characterized by its base pair sequence, is simulated. The simulation
   output is analyzed by generating and analyzing the Free Energy Landscape
   of the system. In order to prove the capacity of prediction of our
   computational method we have analyzed nine promoters of Anabaena PCC
   7120. We are able to identify the transcription starting site of each of
   the promoters as the most populated macrostate in the dynamics. The
   developed procedure allows also to characterize promoter macrostates in
   terms of thermo-statistical magnitudes (free energy and entropy), with
   valuable biological implications. Our results agree with independent
   previous experimental results. Thus, our methods appear as a powerful
   complementary tool for identifying protein binding sites in promoter
   sequences.

AB Family is the smallest unit of people to share most of the lifestyle,
   environmental and genetic factors: They are likely to have similarity in
   many physiological and behavioural aspects. Therefore, we designed a
   protocol to test the effect of large rural Indian families living
   together (Kumbas), on blood pressure variability. We also investigated
   the hypothesis that 'nocturnal dipping' in systolic blood pressure (SBP)
   is not heritable. Members of two families (1 and 2) consisting of 3-4
   generations willingly participated in the study. Both families (natives
   of Chhattisgarh) belong to reasonably peaceful rural area and are
   financially stable. Farming is the main occupation of the members of
   both families. Few members of the families had jobs or small business.
   The null hypothesis regarding heritability of nocturnal dipping trait
   was accepted based on data emanating from either of the studied
   families. Hourly-averaged values depicted less variation in males and
   females of family 1 from midnight to early morning at around 06:00, as
   compared to that in males and females of family 2. The 24 h averages of
   BP in family 2 were significantly higher as compared to that in family
   1. Further, in family 2 the peaks of SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
   and mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurred significantly earlier as
   compared to that in family 1. The peak spread of SBP, DBP, heart rate
   (IIR), MAP and pulse pressure (PP) among the members of family 1 was
   narrower than that for the members of family 2. Arbitrary cut-off values
   for classification of dipping, small sample size, and age dependency of
   nocturnal dipping might have marred outcome of the pedigree analysis of
   nocturnal dipping trait in this study. We have a hunch' that the family
   shares typical temporal ups and downs in 24 h BP and HR. The above
   hypothesis needs confirmation based on studies with large data set
   involving subjective and objective assessment of the effects of
   psychosocial factors on BP and HR variability.

AB Several authors have called attention to the evolutionary importance of
   phenotypic plasticity and niche construction, because such phenomena
   require a new status and a new perspective. Drosophila species are
   traditionally used as models in investigations of phenotypic plasticity,
   although the majority of such research has been conducted with species
   of the subgenus Sophophora, primarily Drosophila melanogaster. In this
   study, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity of Drosophila cardini,
   a Neotropical species of the subgenus Drosophila, and focused on the
   wing size, wing shape, thorax length and wing: thorax ratio of lines
   that were collected in the Brazilian savanna and exposed to different
   temperatures during growth. All of the analyzed traits presented
   plasticity to temperature, and the reaction norms were similar to those
   previously found in other drosophilid species; in addition, the maximum
   values were consistent with the temperature variations at the collection
   sites. The specimens that emerged at low temperatures were larger and
   had more rounded wings compared with those that emerged at high
   temperatures, which were smaller and had narrower wings. We hypothesized
   that the differences observed in the shape of the wings might be
   associated with flight performance. Nevertheless, further investigation
   of the relationships among wing shape, wing loading and flight
   performance is required. Investigations on phenotypic plasticity using
   species with diverse ecologies should help us to better understand how
   this phenomenon operates in nature, and studies of this type must be
   encouraged.

AB Environmental temperature has pervasive effects on the rate of life
   processes in ectothermic animals. Animal performance is affected by
   temperature, but there are finite thermal limits for vital body
   functions, including contraction of the heart. This Review discusses the
   electrical excitation that initiates and controls the rate and rhythm of
   fish cardiac contraction and is therefore a central factor in the
   temperature-dependent modulation of fish cardiac function. The control
   of cardiac electrical excitability should be sensitive enough to respond
   to temperature changes but simultaneously robust enough to protect
   against cardiac arrhythmia; therefore, the thermal resilience and
   plasticity of electrical excitation are physiological qualities that may
   affect the ability of fishes to adjust to climate change. Acute changes
   in temperature alter the frequency of the heartbeat and the duration of
   atrial and ventricular action potentials (APs). Prolonged exposure to
   new thermal conditions induces compensatory changes in ion channel
   expression and function, which usually partially alleviate the direct
   effects of temperature on cardiac APs and heart rate. The most
   heat-sensitive molecular components contributing to the electrical
   excitation of the fish heart seem to be Na+ channels, which may set the
   upper thermal limit for the cardiac excitability by compromising the
   initiation of the cardiac AP at high temperatures. In cardiac and other
   excitable cells, the different temperature dependencies of the outward
   K+ current and inward Na+ current may compromise electrical excitability
   at temperature extremes, a hypothesis termed the temperature-dependent
   depression of electrical excitation.

   Caribbean populations exhibited higher TMVs in the two species, strongly
   suggesting an adaptive shift of the reaction norms toward higher
   temperature in warm-adapted populations. The wing/thorax ratio was also
   analysed, and found to be significantly lower in tropical populations of
   both species. This ratio, which is related to wing loading and flight
   capacity, might evolve independently of body weight itself.

AB Stressful episodic weather is likely to affect the C balance of trees as
   the climate changes, potentially altering survival. However, the role of
   elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in tolerating off-season episodic
   extremes is not clear. We tested for interactive effects of elevated CO2
   and springtime heat stress on photosynthesis for seven genotypes of
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. var. camaldulensis, representing its
   widespread distribution across south-eastern Australia. We grew clonal
   material under glasshouse conditions of ambient (aCO(2); 400 parts per
   million (ppm)) or elevated (eCO(2); 640ppm) [CO2], and air temperatures
   of 25:17 degrees C (day:night), and measured the electron transport rate
   in PSII (ETR), stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) and net CO2
   assimilation (A). Measurements were made before, during and after a
   four-day temperature excursion of 35:27 degrees C. ETR and A were
   similar to 17% higher for plants grown in eCO(2) than in aCO(2).
   Photosynthesis remained stable for plants in eCO(2) during the heatwave.
   Based on the effect size ratio (eCO(2):aCO(2)), g(s) and ETR were
   temporarily affected more by the heatwave than A. A reduction in ETR in
   eCO(2) was the only lasting effect of the heatwave. There were no
   significant differences among genotypes. Correlations between
   photosynthesis and climate of origin differed for plants grown in aCO(2)
   compared with eCO(2), suggesting potential complex and multiple control
   points on photosynthesis.

AB Recent experimental and theoretical studies of biomimetic membrane
   adhesions [Bruinsma , Phys. Rev. E 61, 4253 (2000); Boulbitch , Biophys.
   J. 81, 2743 (2001)] suggested that adhesion mediated by receptor
   interactions is due to the interplay between membrane undulations and a
   double-well adhesion potential, and should be a first-order transition.
   We study the nucleation of membrane adhesion by finding the
   minimum-energy path on the free energy surface constructed from the
   bending free energy of the membrane and the double-well adhesion
   potential. We find a nucleation free energy barrier around 20k(B)T for
   adhesion of flexible membranes, which corresponds to fast nucleation
   kinetics with a time scale of the order of seconds. For cell membranes
   with a larger bending rigidity due to the actin network, the nucleation
   barrier is higher and may require active processes such as the
   reorganization of the cortex network to overcome this barrier. Our
   scaling analysis suggests that the geometry of the membrane shapes of
   the adhesion contact is controlled by the adhesion length that is
   determined by the membrane rigidity, the barrier height, and the length
   scale of the double-well potential, while the energetics of adhesion is
   determined by the depths of the adhesion potential. These results are
   verified by numerical calculations.

   Species-specific climate envelope models are an alternative to
   generalized hardiness zones. We generated climate envelopes for 62
   northern tree species over the same 50-year interval and found an
   average northward shift of 57 kilometers. These changes signal an

AB Inbreeding is expected to increase the variability in size and shape
   within populations. The distinct effects of inbreeding on size and shape
   suggest that they are governed by different developmental pathways. One
   unresolved question is whether the non-allometric shape component is
   partially unconstrained developmentally and therefore whether shape is
   evolvable. In the present study, we utilized a mass outbred population
   of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at standard laboratory conditions.
   Eight lines with equivalent expected levels of inbreeding (F approximate
   to 0.67) were obtained by restricting the size of each population to two
   pairs for nine generations. Nine landmarks were measured on Drosophila
   wings of the inbreed lines and compared with those of the mass
   population. Wing landmarks comprise an excellent model system for
   studying evolution of size and shape. Landmark measurements were
   analyzed with a Procrustes generalized least squares procedure. To
   visualize global shape changes among samples, we reconstructed the mean
   shape and the shape changes related to both the allometric and
   non-allometric components. An increased variability in the
   non-allometric shape component was found with inbreeding. This indicated
   that shape was not entirely developmentally constrained, and therefore
   that shape appears to be evolvable. (C) 2011 The Linnean Society of

AB Climate change is expected to modify plant assemblages in ways that will
   have major consequences for ecosystem functions. How climate change will
   affect community composition will depend on how individual species
   respond, which is likely related to interspecific differences in
   functional traits. The extraordinary plasticity of some plant traits is
   typically neglected in assessing how climate change will affect
   different species. In the Mongolian steppe, we examined whether leaf
   functional traits under ambient conditions and whether plasticity in
   these traits under altered climate could explain climate-induced biomass
   responses in 12 co-occurring plant species. We experimentally created
   three probable climate change scenarios and used a model selection
   procedure to determine the set of baseline traits or plasticity values
   that best explained biomass response. Under all climate change
   scenarios, plasticity for at least one leaf trait correlated with change
   in species performance, while functional leaf-trait values in ambient
   conditions did not. We demonstrate that trait plasticity could play a
   critical role in vulnerability of species to a rapidly changing
   environment. Plasticity should be considered when examining how climate
   change will affect plant performance, species' niche spaces, and
   ecological processes that depend on plant community composition.

AB Nocturnal geckos are active at body temperatures 10-35 degrees C below
   the thermal optima for maximum rate of aerobic metabolism ((V) over dot
   (o2max)) of diurnal lizards. Therefore, given ancestral (diurnal) lizard
   physiology, nocturnality causes a substantial thermal handicap in
   locomotor performance. In prior studies, we hypothesized that a low
   minimum cost of locomotion (C-min) in geckos was an adaptation that
   increased locomotor endurance capacity at low, nocturnal temperatures.
   However, C-min is only part of an integrated system that, in conjunction
   with the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, sets the maximum speed that
   can be sustained aerobically (termed the maximum aerobic speed or MAS).
   We conducted the first phylogenetic analysis of MAS and (V) over dot
   (o2max) in lizards and found that the greatest changes in MAS, C-min and
   (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity temperatures) in the evolutionary
   history of lizards all coincided with the evolution of nocturnality in
   geckos. Geckos active at 15-25 degrees C did not become optimized for
   nocturnal temperatures, or fully offset the thermal effects of
   nocturnality by evolving maximal rates of oxygen consumption comparable
   to diurnal lizards active at 35 degrees C. Geckos did evolve MAS twice
   that of diurnal lizards running at low temperatures by evolving a
   remarkably low C-min. Allometric analysis and phylogenetically
   independent contrasts of (V) over dot (o2max), C-min, and MAS indicate a
   72% evolutionary decrease in (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity
   temperatures) and a 50% evolutionary decrease in C-min concordant with
   the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Experimental measurements show
   that decreased C-min in six species of gecko increased MAS by 50-120%
   compared to diurnal lizards at low temperatures; Thus, geckos
   sufficiently overcame the near paralyzing effects of nocturnal
   temperatures, but only offset about 50% of the decrease in MAS resulting
   from the low maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Although the nocturnal
   environment remains severely suboptimal, the evolution of a low cost of
   locomotion in the ancestor of geckos was highly adaptive for
   nocturnality. We also present a generalized approach to ecophysiological
   evolution that integrates phylogeny with the causal relationships among
   environment, physiology, and performance capacity. With respect to a
   clade, two hypotheses are central to our integrative approach: (1) a
   change of an environmental variable (e.g., temperature) causes a
   performance handicap; and (2) evolution of a physiological variable
   (e.g., minimum cost of locomotion [C-min]) increases performance in the
   derived environment. To test the hypothesis that evolution of a
   physiological variable is adaptive in nature, we suggest determining if
   individuals in nature perform at levels exceeding the performance
   capacity of their hypothetical ancestors and if this additional
   performance capacity is due to the evolution of the physiological
   variable in question.

AB Vertical profiles of chlorophyll concentration and phytoplankton biomass
   at ALOHA (HOT) are analyzed for the time period 1988 to 2004. Two
   different methods are applied: in the standard approach the data are
   averaged over depth horizons and in the alternative approach the
   profiles are shifted to the depth of the deepest subsurface maximum
   before averaging. The results show that the latter is the only
   meaningful way to look at vertical distribution patterns of both
   chlorophyll and phytoplankton in the oligotrophic ocean. In particular,
   a pronounced subsurface maximum of phytoplankton biomass appears only if
   this depth-adjustment method is used. Otherwise the vertical
   displacement of the subsurface biomass due to changes in the subsurface
   light field masks the actual signal: the thickness of the subsurface
   maximum is overestimated and the maximum is reduced. The results of this
   study have far-reaching consequences for the interpretation of the large
   number of profiles of chlorophyll and phytoplankton in the oligotrophic
   ocean. The absence of a subsurface biomass maximum might not be
   necessarily a result of photoacclimation but of inadequate analyses
   combined with coarse vertical resolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Seasonality describes cyclic and largely predictable fluctuations in the
   environment. Such variations in day length, temperature, rainfall, and
   resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong selection
   pressure on organisms to adapt to seasonal environments. However,
   seasonal variations exhibit large scale geographical divergences caused
   by a whole suite of factors such as solar radiation, ocean currents,
   extent of continents, and topography. Realizing these contributions in
   driving patterns of overall seasonality may help advance our
   understanding of the kinds of evolutionary adaptations we should expect
   at a global scale. Here, we introduce a new concept and provide the data
   describing the overall degree of seasonality, based on its two major
   components-amplitude and predictability. Using global terrestrial
   datasets on temperature, precipitation and primary productivity, we show
   that these important seasonal factors exhibit strong differences in
   their spatial patterns with notable asymmetries between the southern and
   the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
   seasonality is highly diverse across latitudes as well as longitudinal
   gradients. This indicates that using a direct measure of seasonality and
   its components, amplitude and predictability, may yield a better
   understanding of how organisms are adapted to seasonal environments and
   provide support for predictions on the consequences of rapid
   environmental change.

AB 1. Climate change is driving a redistribution of species and the
   reconfiguration of ecological communities at a global scale. Persistent
   warming in many regions has caused species to extend their geographical
   ranges into new habitats, with thermally tolerant species often becoming
   competitively dominant over species with colder affinities. Although
   these climate-driven changes in species abundance and diversity are well
   documented, their ecosystem-level implications are poorly understood,
   and resolving whether reconfigured communities can maintain fundamental
   ecosystem functions represents a pressing challenge in an increasingly
   warmer world.
   2. Here, we investigated how climate-driven substitutions of foundation
   species influence processes associated with the cycling of organic
   matter (biomass production, detritus flow, herbivory, decomposition) by
   comparing two habitat-forming kelp species with contrasting thermal
   affinities. We examined the wider ecosystem consequences of such shifts
   for the observed (and predicted) emergence of novel marine forest
   communities in the NE Atlantic, which are expected to become more
   dominated by range-expanding, warm-temperate kelp species.
   3. Warm-temperate kelps both accumulated and released 80% more biomass
   than the cold-temperate species despite being taxonomically closely
   related and morphologically similar. Furthermore, the warm-temperate
   species accumulated biomass and released detritus year-round, whereas
   the cold-temperate species did so during short, discrete periods. The
   warm-temperate kelps supported higher densities of invertebrate grazers
   and were a preferred food source. Finally, their detritus decomposed 6.5
   times faster, despite supporting comparable numbers of detritivores.
   Overall, our results indicate an important shift in organic matter
   circulation along large sections of NE Atlantic coastline following the
   climate-driven expansion of a warm-affinity kelp, with novel forests
   supplying large amounts of temporally continuous-yet highly
   labile-organic matter.
   4. Synthesis. Collectively, our results show that, like species
   invasions, climate-driven range expansions and consequent shifts in the
   identity of dominant species can modify a wide range of important
   ecosystem processes. However, alterations in overall ecosystem
   functioning may be relatively limited where foundation species share
   similar ecological and functional traits.

AB Seasonal shifts in environmental conditions provide predictable cues to
   which organisms can respond in adaptive ways. For example, seasonal
   changes in temperature can induce phenotypes at different times of the
   year that have season-specific fitness benefits. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that embryo responses to seasonal changes in thermal
   environments are adaptively matched to the timing of reproduction
   (environmental-matching hypothesis). We collected eggs of the brown
   anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) from early and late seasons, and exposed
   them to early and late thermal regimes that mimic nest temperatures.
   After measuring offspring morphology and performance, we quantified
   their survival in the field. Females had higher fecundity, but produced
   smaller eggs, early in the season compared with late in the season.
   Late-season eggs exposed to late thermal regimes had relatively high
   survival, but early-season eggs exposed to early thermal regimes had
   similar survival rates to those exposed to mismatched conditions.
   Late-season nest temperatures and late-season eggs produced offspring
   that were relatively large and fast runners. However, despite phenotypic
   benefits of late-season conditions, early-season hatchlings had greater
   survival in the field. Our results do not fully support the
   environmental-matching hypothesis but suggest that selection favours
   seasonal shifts in reproductive investment of mothers (high early-season
   fecundity) over plastic responses of embryos to seasonal environmental
   changes.

AB Artificial selection experiments are potentially powerful, yet
   under-utilized tool of evolutionary and physiological ecology. Here we
   analyze and review three important aspects of such experiments. First,
   we consider the effects of instrumental measurement errors and random
   fluctuations of body mass on the total phenotypic variation. We
   illustrate this with the analysis of measurements of oxygen consumption
   in an open-flow respirometry set-ups. We conclude that measurement
   errors and fluctuations of body mass are likely to reduce the
   repeatability of oxygen consumption by about one third. Using published
   estimates of repeatability of metabolic rates we also showed that it
   does not tend to decline with increasing time between measurements.
   Second, we review data on narrow sense heritability (h(2)) of metabolic
   rates in mammals. The results are equivocal: many studies report very
   low (similar to 0.1) h(2), whereas some recent studies (including our
   own estimates of h 2 in laboratory mice, obtained by means of
   parent-offspring regression) report significant h(2) >= 0.4. Finally, we
   discuss consequences of the lack of replicated lines in artificial
   selection experiments. We focus on the confounding effect of genetic
   drift on statistical inferences related to primary (selected) and
   secondary (correlated) traits, in the absence of replications. We review
   literature data and analyze them following the guidelines formulated by
   Henderson (1989, 1997). We conclude that most results obtained in
   unreplicated experiments are probably robust enough to ascribe them to
   the effect of selection, rather than genetic drift. However, Henderson's
   guidelines by no means should be treated as a legitimate substitute of
   the analysis of variance, based on replicated lines.

AB In many animals, temperatures experienced by developing embryos
   determine offspring sex (e.g. temperature-dependent sex determination,
   TSD), but most studies focus strictly on the effects of mean
   temperature, with little emphasis on the importance of thermal
   fluctuations. In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an
   Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate
   that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but
   not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated
   eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and
   three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is
   determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters.
   Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing
   directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect
   inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that
   TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under
   genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important
   considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms,
   for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of
   TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change
   scenarios.

AB Simulation and prediction of forest productivity in the context of
   climate change is more difficult in mixed forests than that in
   monocultures, because of spatial and species-specific differences in
   tree growth-climate relationships. A detailed study on species-specific
   tree growth-climate relationships and their spatial variability is thus
   essential. Here, we focus on a mixed forest at Changbai Mountain in
   semi-humid area bestriding the China-Korea border which has experienced
   rapid climate warming over the past 50 years. Three dominate tree
   species, one coniferous (Korean pine) and two broad-leaved species
   (Mongolian oak and Manchurian ash), were selected to analyze how climate
   warming has affected and will affect tree growth in 21st century along
   an elevational gradient. Our results showed enhanced growth after 1960s.
   This trend is predicted to continue until 2070, although elevation could
   modify the main patterns of climate responses observed among the
   different species. Compared with low or medium elevations, the
   correlation coefficient between tree radial growth and temperature was
   lower at higher sites, except in the case of Mongolian oak, in which
   there was a similar pattern at all three elevational levels. Korean pine
   at medium elevation and Machurian ash at the low elevation grew the
   fastest. Our work confirmed sensitivities of growth-temperature differ
   in species and across the elevational distribution. It contributes to
   the estimation of terrestrial carbon sink dynamics.

AB We investigated temperature-dependent responses of metabolism and
   thermal tolerance in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and longear sunfish
   (L. megalotis). Each species showed significant differences in standard
   metabolic rate (SMR) and thermal tolerance among the three acclimation
   temperatures (10degreesC, 20degreesC, and 30degreesC). These sympatric
   centrarchids colonize microhabitats with different hydrodynamic and
   thermal regimes, which may be related to species differences in
   physiological responses to temperature. We found no interspecific
   differences in SMR and thermal tolerance. However, because there are
   differences in microhabitat utilization which may promote an adaptive
   suite of physiological tolerances unique to each species, we provide
   evidence suggesting that L. megalotis has greater physiological
   plasticity for SMR than L. macrochirus and that L. macrochirus has
   greater plasticity in thermal tolerance than L. megalotis. Trends in
   physiological plasticity with correlates of microhabitat utilization are
   discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Processed are 57596 dated series of tree-rings width (TRW) from the
   International Tree-ring Data Bank. The results obtained indicate that:
   1. The TRW is strongly correlated with tree age. Periods of cambium
   activity are strictly dependent on the age of the trees. Therefore,
   there is a strong correlation between TRW and periods of radial growth.
   It is suggested that synchronization of the periods of radial growth in
   the first 150 years of trees life with cycles of climatic factors leads
   to increase in TRW. 2. Satisfactory coincidence between latitudinal
   profiles of TRW, on the one hand, and climatic and biological
   indicators, on the other hand, is observed. Latitudinal profile of TRW
   gets its form under the influence of climate and assimilating mass
   productivity. 3. Latitudinal change of the TRW in the Cretaceous had a
   pronounced displacement of a maximum from equator toward 30 degrees NL.
   Growth gain of Cretaceous gymnosperms was about twice higher than that
   of modern trees. Such asymmetry of paleolatitudinal profile of TRW
   sharply distinguishes it from modern latitudinal profiles that follow
   climatic parameters.

AB The tropical oceans drive climatic phenomena such as the El
   Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian-Australian monsoon, which
   have global scale impacts. In order to understand future climatic
   developments, it is essential to understand how the tropical climate has
   developed in the past, on both short and longer timescales. However,
   good instrumental records are limited to the last few decades. The
   oxygen isotopic (delta O-18) composition and strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca)
   ratio of massive corals have been widely used as proxies for past
   changes in sea surface temperature (SST) of the tropical and subtropical
   oceans, because the geochemistry of the skeleton is believed to vary as
   a function of several environmental parameters (such as seawater
   temperature, salinity, light, ... ). However, recent microanalytical
   studies have revealed large amplitude variations in Sr/Ca and oxygen
   isotopic composition in coral skeletons; variations that cannot be
   ascribed to changes in SST or in salinity. Such micro- and nanometer
   scale studies of geochemical variations in coral skeletons are still few
   and somewhat scattered in terms of the species studied and the problems
   addressed. But collectively they show the great potential for
   determining chemical variations at length scales of direct relevance to
   the biomineralization process. For example, it is now possible to
   measure geochemical variations within the two basic, micrometer-sized
   building blocks of the coral skeleton: Early mineralization zones (EMZ)
   and aragonite fibres. Such micro- and nanometer scale observations, in
   combination with controlled laboratory culturing of corals, hold the
   promise of yielding important new insights into the various
   biomineralization processes that may affect the chemical and isotopic
   composition of the skeletons. One aim of these efforts is to better
   understand the elemental and isotopic fractionation mechanisms in order
   to improve the conversion of the geochemical variability into
   environmental changes.

AB In this study of Acartia hudsonica, the change in egg types from
   subitaneous eggs to dormant eggs was investigated. Temperature and
   photoperiod were hypothesized to act as the proximal environmental cues
   inducing this population to produce dormant eggs, and the variation in
   the dormant egg responses of individual females was quantified. Some
   field-collected females produced some dormant eggs early in the spring
   (March and April), but most of the switch to dormant eggs occurred in
   late June. Short-term experiments showed that increased temperatures
   increased the percentage of dormant eggs produced, whereas increased
   length of day did not. Long-term experiments showed a different pattern
   from short-term experiments, indicating that duration of exposure to
   particular temperatures or photoperiods may influence dormant egg
   production. Under certain conditions, it appeared that nearly all
   copepods were capable of producing dormant eggs, although identical
   experimental conditions did not affect all individuals similarly. In
   several experiments that revealed a significant treatment effect,
   between 42% and 85% of the variance detected could be attributed to
   variation among individuals. Also, the fraction of individuals producing
   dormant eggs generally increased with increasing water temperature. In
   Narragansett Bay, A. hudsonica appears to produce dormant eggs primarily
   in response to increased water temperatures although an effect of
   photoperiod could not be ruled out. Furthermore, individual responses
   vary greatly. Appreciation of such variation in an important life
   history trait, such as embryonic dormancy, is important in understanding
   how this population may be adapted to its environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier

   By fitting statistical models on the duration of the nestling period, we

   salinity at 0-20 m depth in March (having a positive and a negative
   effect, respectively). We propose that when the phyto-plankton bloom
   occurs in early spring, adverse oceanographic conditions, i.e. low
   temperature and high salinity in March, have a negative effect on puffin
   reproduction by degradation of the prey availability (mainly Clupea
   harengus) for chick-feeding adults three months later.

AB Range expansion and population establishment of individual species can
   have significant impacts on previously established food webs and
   predator-prey dynamics. The stone crab (Menippe spp.) is found
   throughout southwestern North Atlantic waters, from North Carolina
   through the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American Caribbean, including
   the Greater Antilles. Recent observations suggest that stone crabs have
   become better established on certain oyster reefs in North Carolina than
   in the early 1900s when they we first observed in NC. To assess the
   predatory impact of stone crabs on oysters, we (1) quantified stone crab
   densities on subtidal oyster reefs in Pamlico Sound, NC using scuba
   surveys, and (2) conducted laboratory predation experiments to assess
   the functional response of stone crabs to varying densities of oysters.
   We then (3) analyzed previously unpublished functional response data on
   another important oyster predator, the mud crab Panopeus herbstii.
   Finally, we (4) compared and contrasted potential predatory impacts of
   stone, mud and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). The functional response
   data and analyses for both stone crabs and mud crabs were consistent
   with a type II functional response. Mud crabs, on a m(2) basis,
   inflicted the highest proportional mortality on oysters over a 24 hour
   period, followed by stone and then blue crabs. Proportional mortality
   did not vary significantly with oyster size; however, relatively small
   and large oysters were consumed disproportionately less than
   medium-sized oysters, likely due to the mechanical inability of stone
   crabs to handle small oysters, and the inability to crush large oysters.
   Although stone crabs appear to be established in Pamlico Sound at
   densities equivalent to densities in other systems such as the U.S.
   Florida Panhandle, their predatory activities on oysters are not
   expected to have as significant a negative impact on oyster populations
   compared to other resident predators such as mud crabs. (C) 2011

AB Understanding the dynamic relationships between seasonal water use,
   stand density, and tree size in semi-arid forests of the southwestern US
   is important for predicting climate change impacts and for tailoring
   forest restoration prescriptions to mitigate such impacts. Using
   hydrogen stable isotope ratio (delta D) analyses of precipitation, soil
   water, and stem water over a 2-year sampling period, we found that
   winter precipitation was the dominant water source for ponderosa pines
   (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) in northern Arizona in all seasons. Soil and
   stem waters were isotopically more enriched in high- than low-density
   stands. Isotopic analyses indicated large trees were more reliant on
   deep soil water than small trees. Our results indicate that management
   actions that maintain or create low-density stands of large
   deeply-rooted trees increase tree access to winter precipitation via
   deep soil storage and thus may help mitigate impacts of climate warming
   on tree health. Our findings provide new understanding of the complex
   relationships among seasonal water use, stand density, and tree size in
   a region where a drying climate puts increasing stress on forests. (C)

   and live-bait. Samples taken during 1984-1986 and the 2004-2009 periods
   provided length, weight and age data. A comparison of the population
   structure was made showing a decrease in the median and means of fork
   length in the 80's (median: 55 cm) and recent years (median: 51 cm), an
   increased participation of smaller individuals (40 cm) in recent
   catches, a high variability of lengths in each year class and a decrease
   of the condition factor K. These results indicate alterations in the
   population structure and dynamics. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters
   calculated for the recent years were L-infinity = 669 mm; k = 0.24
   yr(-1); t(o) = -3.8. CPUE data for the studied period seems to be stable
   (mean annual catch of 20,000 ton). However, the unit of effort used in
   Brazil (fishing days) does not reflect changes in fishing power and
   technology properly as occurred during 30 years of exploitation. It is
   concluded that the present situation requires a close monitoring of the
   fishery.

   present a double threat. To manage marine resources effectively, it is
   necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment.
   Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance
   have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many
   cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on
   each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change
   as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between
   population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our
   ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes.
   Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables

   final year of the field study, water temperature, water depth,
   conductivity, total suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon,
   instantaneous streamflow velocity, sediment grain size and sediment
   organic matter were determined. Total microbial biomass was measured
   using the phospholipid phosphate technique (PLP) and ranged between 2
   and 134 nmol PLP . g(-1) dry weight sediment with a mean of 25 nmol PLP
   . g(-1) . Microbial community structure was determined using the
   phospholipid fatty acid analysis and indicated seasonal shifts in
   sedimentary microbial community composition. January to June sedimentary
   microbial biomass was predominately prokaryotic (60% +/- 2), whereas
   microeukaryotes dominated samples collected during the late summer (55%
   +/- 2.4) and fall (60% +/- 2). These changes were correlated with stream
   discharge and water temperature. Microbial community structure varied
   spatially about a reservoir with prokaryotic biomass dominant at
   upstream stations and eukaryotic biomass dominant at downstream
   stations. These findings reveal that sedimentary microbial communities
   in streams are dynamic responding to the seasonal variation of
   environmental factors.

AB Whereas Arctic benthic decapods are not a species-rich group, they can

   We studied the decapod fauna from Isfjorden (Svalbard, Norway, 78A
   degrees N) by sampling from 22 stations and comparing with 50 and
   100-year-old data from the same localities. Our data provide no evidence
   of changes in the species composition of decapods during the last 50
   years. Hence, we do not observe the poleward shift of species found in
   several pelagic communities in the North Atlantic. However, there is
   statistical evidence for changes in the community structure between 1908
   and both 1958 and 2007. The main change is a shift towards communities
   more dominated by the spider crab Hyas araneus and the hermit crab
   Pagurus pubescens in 2007, and with a corresponding decrease in the two
   shrimp species Lebbeus polaris and Spirontocaris spinus. These shrimps
   are specialist predators compared to the more opportunistic, scavenging
   crabs. We argue that increased disturbance levels may be a causal factor
   behind the observed community change, with likely sources of disturbance
   including trawling and climatic fluctuations.

   environment and thermal climate. Specifically, introduced species have
   the potential to evolve different thermal tolerances than native
   populations due to rapid evolution and novel selection pressures. Our
   study examined critical thermal tolerance in two introduced lizard
   species, the European wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in Ohio and
   Kentucky, and the Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) from Texas
   through Alabama. We tested the hypotheses that critical thermal maximum,
   minimum, and breadth varies among introduced populations of P. muralis
   and H. turcicus, and that critical thermal tolerance broadens when
   moving away from the introduction site, because dispersal across novel
   environments may remove dispersers with narrow thermal tolerances. We
   found that among P. muralis populations, CTmin and thermal breadth were
   significantly different. Specifically, when moving away from the
   introduction site, lizards exhibited increased cold tolerance and
   broader thermal breadth. Variability in thermal parameters were also
   lowest at the site closest to the introduction point in P. muralis. In
   contrast, H. turcicus had no significant differences in critical thermal
   minimum, maximum, or breadth among sites, or with respect to distance
   from introduction point. However, we did find little variability in
   thermal maximum, compared to greater variability in overall tolerance
   and critical thermal minimums. Thus, this study shows that selection on
   thermal tolerance and dispersal characteristics occur in novel climatic
   environments. Understanding how thermal tolerance changes over time can
   aid in predicting establishment and movement of introduced species, with
   applications for native species during a time of global climatic change.

AB Bergmann's rule states that endothermic species from cool areas tend to
   have larger body sizes than those from warm areas. Allen's rule
   maintains that endothermic species from cool environments should have
   shorter extremities than their counterparts from warm areas. Although a
   number of studies have supported both rules, the validity of these
   trends remains controversial, especially for ectothermic organisms.
   Here, we studied intraspecific morphological variation in Four-Eyed
   Frogs (Pleuroaema thaul) to determine if these rules are valid in an
   ecogeographic context. Specifically, we analyzed how morphology varies
   across nine traits in males of P. thaul collected from nine localities
   in Chile. A discriminant analysis of all measured traits indicated
   differentiation between localities, and the first two canonical
   variables explained similar to 80% of the total variation in
   morphometric features. Additionally, these two canonical variables were
   correlated with precipitation and monthly minimum temperature. To
   determine the validity of Allen's rule, a stepwise discriminant analysis
   was performed incorporating three morphological variables measured on
   the extremities of the individuals. This analysis indicated no variation
   in the traits between populations. The first canonical variable of the
   discriminant analysis explained 90% of the total variation in extremity
   morphology and was not correlated with environmental variables. We did,
   however, detect a correlation between the canonical variables of the
   stepwise discriminant analysis, and both minimum temperature and
   precipitation. Overall, our results indicate that the populations of P.
   thrall in Chile comply with Bergmann's rule.

AB Gender difference in thermal comfort for Chinese people was investigated
   through two laboratory experiments. Both subjective assessment and
   objective measurement were taken during the experiment. Skin temperature
   (17 points) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured in one of the
   experiment. Our results show that there are gender differences in
   thermal comfort for Chinese people. Correlation of thermal sensation
   votes and air temperature and vapor pressure shows that females are more
   sensitive to temperature and less sensitive to humidity than males.
   Subjective assessment, skin temperature and HRV analysis suggest that
   females prefer neutral or slightly warmer condition, due to their
   constantly lower skin temperature and the fact that mean skin
   temperature is a good predictor of sensation and discomfort below
   neutrality. Female comfortable operative temperature (26.3 degrees C) is
   higher than male comfortable operative temperature (25.3 degrees C),
   although males and females have almost the same neutral temperature and
   that there is no gender difference in thermal sensation near neutral
   conditions.

AB Habitat quality and fish success, in terms of growth and mortality, are
   presumably correlated, and abiotic conditions are likely to be a major
   component in determining habitat quality. We assessed habitat quality in
   terms of fish growth and mortality using basic abiotic factors as the
   major variables. Juvenile summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus (42 to
   59 mm total length) were caged at 5 sites in and around Masonboro
   Island, North Carolina, USA, during June and July 1999. Temperature,
   dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH were recorded every 30 min at each
   enclosure site during the experiment. Potential predators were excluded
   by cages and known quantities of food were provided to reduce potential
   impacts of food availability. Fish were individually tagged, and growth
   rates calculated for surviving fish. Abiotic conditions varied
   significantly among sites, although no differences in growth rates were
   detected among sites. Variability in growth rates both within and among
   sites was high, with 1 site experiencing total mortality. Results
   suggest that basic abiotic conditions, at the levels and durations that
   occur within a southeastern US estuary during summer, have little impact
   on juvenile summer flounder growth, but may influence survival.

AB Questions: Sand storms from east Inner Mongolia are a major threat to
   the ecological safety of North China and actions are desirable to
   control further desertification. Small patches of relict Pinus
   tabulaeformis could play a major role in this. The climate signal
   recorded in the tree-ring widths and the dates of past regeneration
   episodes of these trees growing at the northern border of their natural
   distribution are considered here.
   Location: Ortindag Sand Land in North China.
   Methods: We collected increment cores from relict P. tabulaeformis trees
   at five sites, built a standard tree-ring chronology for each site and a
   regional tree- ring chronology from the three longest site chronologies,
   analysed the tree growth/climate relationships and determined the
   germination years of the trees to recognize past regeneration dynamics.
   Results: Monthly precipitation and relative air humidity in the previous
   and current growing seasons are the major limiting factors for the
   radial growth of P. tabulaeformis. Years with a high frequency of absent
   tree rings are characterized by particularly extreme dry conditions.
   These results are supported by negative correlations between radial
   growth and monthly maximum temperature and evaporation during the
   growing season. In a 163-year time series of precipitation from previous
   July to current June reconstructed from the tree rings, cycles with wave
   lengths of 2-3, 17.4 and 20.5 years are significant.
   Conclusion: P. tabulaeformis trees are reliable recorders of high and
   low frequency variations of dry/wet environmental conditions in the
   Ortindag Sand Land. Their age structures within the forest patches prove
   that they regenerate preferen-they regenerate preferen-preferentially in
   less dry periods.

AB The critical thermal limits of organisms and the thermal sensitivity of
   their performance tend to vary predictably across latitudinal gradients.
   There has been comparatively less investigation into variation in
   thermal biology with elevation, despite similar gradients in
   environmental temperatures. To redress this, we examined critical
   thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax), thermal sensitivity of locomotor
   performance, and shelter site attributes, in three lizard species that
   replace one another along a contiguous elevation gradient in
   south-eastern Australia. The species examined consisted of a highland
   specialist, Liopholis guthega, mid-elevation species, Liopholis montana,
   and lowland species, Liopholis whitii. We found similar habitat
   attributes between the species, but L. guthega predominantly occurred in
   open habitat, which might reflect a strategy for maximizing exposure to
   insolation. We found intraspecific variation in lizard thermal traits,
   most notably in cold tolerance of L. guthega and in both heat and cold
   tolerance of L. whitii, suggesting population-specific variables acting
   on thermal physiology rather than a species distribution maintained by
   distinct thermal tolerances. This study represents one of the few
   examinations of thermal trait variability within and between species
   with elevation in a temperate system and provides evidence for thermal
   physiology driven by adaptation and/or physiological plasticity to local
   conditions.

AB Synchrony among populations (i.e. spatial covariation in temporal
   fluctuations of population size or growth rate) is a common feature to
   many animals. Both large-scale autocorrelated climatic factors (the
   'Moran effect') and dispersal between populations are candidates to
   explain synchrony, although their relative influence is difficult to
   assess. Only a few investigations have reported patterns of synchrony
   among freshwater populations, and even fewer directly related these
   patterns to an environmental variable. In the present study, we analysed
   the spatio-temporal patterns of fluctuation of 57 brown trout
   populations widespread across France, each sampled continuously during 5
   years. We compared the respective influence of connectivity and stream
   distance within basins (i.e. that potentially allow a basin-scale
   dispersal) and environmental factors (hydrological and air temperature
   variables, available for 37 sites) on the synchrony of brown trout
   cohort densities (0 +, 1 + and adults). A series of Mantel tests
   revealed that the degree of synchrony was not related to connectivity or
   stream distance between sites, suggesting no effect of dispersal at the
   basin-scale. The degree of synchrony among sites for the 0 + fish was
   significantly related to the degree of hydrological synchrony (based on
   high flows during the emergence period). For all three age classes, the
   synchrony in the temperature patterns did not explain synchrony in trout
   dynamics. Our results allow us to discuss the respective influence of
   dispersal and climatic factors on the spatio-temporal patterns of trout
   dynamics at the basin scale.

AB The anole fauna of the Lesser Antilles is depauperate in relation to
   that of the Greater Antilles, where complex communities characterized by
   adaptive specialization and convergent structure are present. Much of
   this adaptation is the result of changes in body size and shape,
   probably as a result of interspecific competition. Here we present data
   on variation in size and shape within a solitary Lesser Antillean
   species occupying an ecologically heterogenous island, and test the
   hypothesis that natural selection for varying environmental conditions
   is the cause of this variation. Univariate (analysis of variance),
   bivariate (analysis of covariance) and multivariate (multiple-group
   principal component analysis, canonical variate analysis) analysis
   showed that there is considerable geographic variation in size and shape
   within Anolis oculatus on Dominica. Partial Mantel tests rejected the
   null hypothesis of no association between size and shape and
   environmental variation. The possible proximate and evolutionary
   mechanisms responsible for these patterns are discussed. Despite these
   overall associations, a considerable amount of variation in shape
   appears to be unrelated to environmental variation. (C) 1997 The Linnean

PY 2012
AB Most organisms exhibit phenotypic plasticity as an evolved response to
   environmental variation; hence there is widespread hope that adaptive
   plasticity might lessen the detrimental impacts of environmental change
   on individuals and populations. Here, I discuss the special role that
   plasticity in behaviour can play under rapid environmental change. This
   role arises because behavioural modes of plasticity are common and
   permit relatively rapid and reversible responses to changing conditions.
   Key issues are the degree to which behavioural plasticity improves
   individual fitness, and the impact that plasticity has on population
   persistence. Behavioural plasticity is quite often beneficial for
   individuals, and in some cases accounts for most of the observed
   phenotypic response to environmental change. However, there are several
   reasons for expecting that maladaptive behavioural plasticity may be
   especially important in the context of anthropogenic impacts, and the
   many reports of ecological traps suggest that maladaptive responses to
   environmental changes caused by humans are widespread. The
   population-level consequences of plasticity are not well studied, but
   limited evidence suggests that behavioural responses have enabled
   persistence or reduced population declines. I conclude by highlighting
   several topics on which further research is needed.

AB Demographic compensation arises when vital rates change in opposite
   directions across populations, buffering the variation in population
   growth rates, and is a mechanism often invoked to explain the stability
   of species geographic ranges. However, studies on demographic
   compensation have disregarded the effects of temporal variation in vital
   rates and their temporal correlations, despite theoretical evidence that
   stochastic dynamics can affect population persistence in temporally
   varying environments. We carried out a seven-year-long demographic study
   on the perennial plant Arabis alpina (L.) across six populations
   encompassing most of its elevational range. We discovered demographic
   compensation in the form of negative correlations between the means of
   plant vital rates, but also between their temporal coefficients of
   variation, correlations and elasticities. Even if their contribution to
   demographic compensation was small, this highlights a previously
   overlooked, but potentially important, role of stochastic processes in
   stabilising population dynamics at range margins.

AB Obtaining reliable estimates of marine survival is essential for
   understanding anadromous salmon population dynamics. Two common
   approaches to estimating marine survival are (a) dividing abundance of
   returning adult salmon abundance by abundance of smolts from the same
   cohort, or (b) tagging a portion of the migrating smolts and estimating
   the return rate of tagged adults. This study compared these two
   approaches to estimating marine survival for coho salmon, Oncorhynchus
   kisutch (Walbaum), across multiple years in three California streams.
   Abundance-based survival estimates were higher than tag-based estimates;
   average estimates for the two techniques differed from 1.5-fold to
   7.4-fold across streams. One likely cause for these divergent estimates
   is migration of juveniles from natal habitat before smolt trapping
   begins, resulting in an underestimate of smolt abundance and an
   overestimate of marine survival rate for the abundance-based method.
   Estimates of marine survival obtained from abundance estimates and tag
   returns are not directly comparable.

   successive parturial moults. However, females maintained under constant
   darkness entered in reproduction after 136 +/- 5.50 days and underwent
   only one parturial moult. To evaluate the male-effect on the onset of
   reproduction, different experiments were conducted highlighting that
   male presence speeds up the lag-time of females maintained at LD 16 : 8.
   We can conclude that long photophases, especially LD 16 : 8, and male

AB In the intertidal zone in the Pacific Northwest, body temperatures of
   sessile marine organisms can reach 35 degrees C for an extended time
   during low tide, resulting in potential physiological stress. We used
   immunochemical assays to examine the effects of thermal stress on
   endogenous Hsp70 levels in the intertidal barnacle Balanus glandula.
   After thermal stress, endogenous Hsp70 levels did not increase above
   control levels in B. glandula exposed to 20 and 28 degrees C. In a
   separate experiment, endogenous Hsp70 levels were higher than control
   levels when B. glandula was exposed to 34 degrees C for 8.5 h. Although
   an induced heat-shock response was observed, levels of conjugated
   ubiquitin failed to indicate irreversible protein damage at temperatures
   up to 34 degrees C. With metabolic labeling, we examined temperature
   acclimation and thermally induced heat-shock proteins in B. glandula. An
   induced heat-shock response of proteins in the 70-kDa region (Hsp70)
   occurred in B. glandula above 23 degrees C. This heat-shock response was
   similar in molting and non-molting barnacles. Acclimation of B. glandula
   to relatively higher temperatures resulted in higher levels of protein
   synthesis in the 70-kDa region and lack of an upward shift in the
   induction temperature for heat-shock proteins. Our results suggest that
   B. glandula may be well adapted to life in the high intertidal zone but
   may lack the plasticity to acclimate to higher temperatures.

AB Despite considerable work on the upper and lower lethal limits of
   insects, several major taxa have received little attention. We
   investigated the lower and upper thermal tolerances and cold hardiness
   strategy of Antarctopsocus jeanneli Badonnel (Psocoptera: Elipsocidae)
   from sub-Antarctic Marion Island. A. jeanneli is freeze intolerant and,
   more specifically, moderately chill tolerant. Field fresh A. jeanneli
   had a mean supercooling point (SCP) of -11.1degreesC, whereas LT50 was
   -7.7degreesC, indicating pre-freeze mortality. A. jeanneli responds to
   acclimation: mean SCP increased from -15.8degreesC at a treatment
   temperature of 0 to -7.3degreesC at 15degreesC, as a result of a shift
   in the proportion of individuals in the high and low groups of the
   bimodal SCP distribution. A. jeanneli has upper thermal tolerances that
   are lower than those of other insect species on Marion Island, but
   within the range of expected microhabitat temperatures. Further study
   will establish whether freeze intolerance is characteristic of
   Psocoptera.

AB Spatial and temporal variations in physico-chemical properties of
   coastal waters play a major role in determining the density, diversity
   and occurrence of phytoplankton. The present study is conducted to
   assess spatio-temporal pattern of phytoplankton assemblage in the
   southern parts of the Caspian Sea (CS) which in turn can serve as an
   ecological health indicator in this region. Among 64 identified
   phytoplankton species, diatoms (37 species and 66.2%) and Dinophyceae
   (11 species and 18.2%) were dominant. Non-metric multidimensional
   scaling (NMDS) were employed to reveal Spatial and temporal
   distributions of phytoplankton assemblages. Four groups were established
   using hierarchical clustering based on species richness similarities
   which were absolutely represented the four seasons. The summer and
   spring samples were highly separated from the winter and autumn samples.
   The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model showed that temporal
   patterns of phytoplankton assemblages were mostly explained by chemical
   factors (silicate, phosphate, and nitrite) and temperature. In
   conclusion, results of this study suggested that spatio-temporal
   patterns of phytoplankton in the southern part of the CS are closely
   associated with seasonal variations in river flow and temperature. The
   temporal patterns are apparently dominant in this area and water
   nutrients are mainly responsible for seasonal changes.

AB Long-term patterns in fish phenology in the western Dutch Wadden Sea
   were studied using a 53 year (1960-2013) high resolution time series of
   daily kom-fyke catches in spring and autumn. Trends in first appearance,
   last occurrence and peak abundance were analysed for the most common
   species in relation to mode of life (pelagic, demersal, benthopelagic)
   and biogeographic guild (northern or southern distribution). Climate
   change in the western Wadden Sea involved an increase in water
   temperature from 1980 onwards. The main pattern in first day of
   occurrence, peak occurrence and last day of occurrence was similar: a
   positive trend over time and a correlation with spring and summer water
   temperature. This is counterintuitive; with increasing temperature, an
   advanced immigration of fish species would be expected. An explanation
   might be that water temperatures have increased offshore as well and
   hence fish remain longer there, delaying their immigration to the Wadden
   Sea. The main trend towards later date of peak occurrence and last day
   of occurrence was in line with our expectations: a forward shift in
   immigration into the Wadden Sea implies also that peak abundance is
   delayed. As a consequence of the increased water temperature, autumn
   water temperature remains favourable longer than before. For most of the
   species present, the Wadden Sea is not near the edge of their
   distributional range. The most striking phenological shifts occurred in
   those individual species for which the Wadden Sea is near the southern
   or northern edge of their distribution.

AB One hundred years ago, Andrew D. Hopkins estimated the progressive delay
   in tree leaf-out with increasing latitude, longitude, and elevation,
   referred to as "Hopkins' bioclimatic law." What if global warming is
   altering this well-known law? Here, based on similar to 20,000
   observations of the leaf-out date of four common temperate tree species
   located in 128 sites at various elevations in the European Alps, we
   found that the elevation-induced phenological shift (EPS) has
   significantly declined from 34 d.1,000 m(-1) conforming to Hopkins'
   bioclimatic law in 1960, to 22 d.1,000 m(-1) in 2016, i.e., -35%. The
   stronger phenological advance at higher elevations, responsible for the
   reduction in EPS, is most likely to be connected to stronger warming
   during late spring as well as to warmer winter temperatures. Indeed,
   under similar spring temperatures, we found that the EPS was
   substantially reduced in years when the previous winter was warmer. Our
   results provide empirical evidence for a declining EPS over the last six
   decades. Future climate warming may further reduce the EPS with
   consequences for the structure and function of mountain forest
   ecosystems, in particular through changes in plant-animal interactions,
   but the actual impact of such ongoing change is today largely unknown.

AB Aim The goal of this study was to understand better the role of
   interannual and interdecadal climatic variation on local
   pre-EuroAmerican settlement fire regimes in fire-prone Jeffrey pine
   (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) dominated forests in the northern Sierra
   Nevada Mountains.
   Location Our study was conducted in a 6000-ha area of contiguous mixed
   Jeffrey pine-white fir (Abies concolor Gordon & Glend.) forest on the
   western slope of the Carson Range on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe,
   Nevada.
   Methods Pre-EuroAmerican settlement fire regimes (i.e. frequency, return
   interval, extent, season) were reconstructed in eight contiguous
   watersheds for a 200-year period (1650-1850) from fire scars preserved
   in the annual growth rings of nineteenth century cut stumps and recently
   dead pre-settlement Jeffrey pine trees. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA)
   and correlation analysis were used to examine relationships between tree
   ring-based reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI),
   Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and
   pre-EuroAmerican fire regimes in order to assess the influence of
   drought and equatorial and north Pacific teleconnections on fire
   occurrence and fire extent.
   Results For the entire period of record (1650-1850), wet conditions were
   characteristic of years without fires. In contrast, fire years were
   associated with drought. Drought intensity also influenced fire extent
   and the most widespread fires occurred in the driest years. Years with
   widespread fires were also preceded by wet conditions 3 years before the
   fire. Widespread fires were also associated with phase changes of the
   PDO, with the most widespread burns occurring when the phase changed
   from warm (positive) to cold (negative) conditions. Annual SOI and fire
   frequency or extent were not associated in our study. At decadal time
   scales, burning was more widespread during decades that were dryer and
   characterized by La Nina and negative PDO conditions. Interannual and
   interdecadal fire-climate relationships were not stable over time. From
   1700 to 1775 there was no interannual relationship between drought, PDO,
   and fire frequency or extent. However, from 1775 to 1850, widespread
   fires were associated with dry years preceded by wet years. This period
   also had the strongest association between fire extent and the PDO. In
   contrast, fire-climate associations at interdecadal time scales were
   stronger in the earlier period than in the later period. The change from
   strong interdecadal to strong interannual climate influence was
   associated with a breakdown in decadal scale constructive relationships
   between PDO and SOI.
   Main conclusions Climate strongly influenced pre-settlement pine forest
   fire regimes in northern Sierra Nevada. Both interannual and
   interdecadal climatic variation regulated conditions conducive to fire
   activity, and longer term changes in fire frequency and extent
   correspond with climate-mediated changes observed in both the northern
   and southern hemispheres. The sensitivity of fire regimes to shifts in
   modes of climatic variability suggests that climate was a key regulator
   of pine forest ecosystem structure and dynamics before EuroAmerican
   settlement. An understanding of pre-EuroAmerican fire-climate
   relationships may provide useful insights into how fire activity in
   contemporary forests may respond to future climatic variation.

AB This paper compares precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperature
   and solar radiation estimates from the Hadley Centre's HadRM3 regional
   climate model (RCM), (50 x 50 km grid cells), with observed data from 15
   meteorological station in the UK, for the period 1960-90. The aim was to
   investigate how well the HadRM3 is able to represent weather
   characteristics for a historical period (hindcast) for which validation
   data exist. The rationale was to determine if the HadRM3 data contain
   systematic errors and to investigate how suitable the data are for use
   in climate change impact studies at particular locations. Comparing
   modelled and observed data helps assess and quantify the uncertainty
   introduced to climate impact studies. The results show that the model
   performs very well for some locations and weather variable combinations,
   but poorly for others. Maximum temperature estimations are generally
   good, but minimum temperature is overestimated and extreme cold events
   are not represented well. For precipitation, the model produces too many
   small events leading to a serious under estimation of the number of dry
   days (zero precipitation), whilst also over- or underestimating the mean
   annual total. Estimates represent well the temporal distribution of
   precipitation events. The model systematically over-estimates solar
   radiation, but does produce good quality estimates at some locations. It
   is concluded that the HadRM3 data are unsuitable for detailed (i.e.
   daily time step simulation model based) site-specific impacts studies in
   their current form. However, the close similarity between modelled and
   observed data for the historical case raises the potential for using
   simple adjustment methods and applying these to future projection data.

AB The lack of a mechanistic basis has hampered modelling isoprene emission
   responses to environmental drivers, in particular the simulation of
   isoprene emissions under different CO2 concentrations. Here, we advance
   previous semi-mechanistic model formulations by introducing a model that
   explicitly links electron availability for other purpose than carbon
   assimilation (or available energy for secondary metabolism processes;
   supply-constraint) and enzyme activity (capacity-constraint) to
   emissions. We furthermore investigate the sensitivity of the model to
   variations in photosynthetic and emission-specific parameters. By
   comparing species-specific simulations with experimental data, we
   demonstrate that differences in photosynthetic characteristics can
   explain inter-species differences in emissions. Interestingly, the
   seasonal development of emissions could also be explained to some degree
   by the change in energy supply from photosynthesis throughout the
   season. In addition, we show that the principal responses are not
   limited to isoprene but can be formulated to describe the emission of
   other light-dependent volatile species. The proposed model is suitable
   for implementation into regional and global models, particularly those
   that already provide species-specific photosynthesis estimates.

AB We quantified a broad range of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) leaf
   phenotypes for initially warm-grown (25/20 degrees C day/night) plants
   that were exposed to cold (5 degrees C) for periods of a few hours to 45
   d before being transferred back to the warm, where leaves were allowed
   to mature. This allowed us to address the following questions: (1) For
   how long do warm-grown plants have to experience cold before developing
   leaves become irreversibly cold acclimated? (2) To what extent is the
   de-acclimation process associated with changes in leaf anatomy and
   physiology? We show that leaves that experience cold for extended
   periods during early development exhibit little plasticity in either
   photosynthesis or respiration, and they do not revert to a
   warm-associated carbohydrate profile. The eventual expansion rate in the
   warm was inversely related to the duration of previous cold treatment.
   Moreover, cold exposure of immature/developing leaves for as little as 5
   d resulted in irreversible changes in the morphology of leaves that
   subsequently matured in the warm, with 15 d cold being sufficient for a
   permanent alteration of leaf anatomy. Collectively, these results
   highlight the impact of transitory cold during early leaf development in
   determining the eventual phenotype of leaves that mature in the warm.

   pattern. Vertebrate and invertebrate remains from these three coastal
   sites contain similar suites of estuarine animals. However, Swift Creek
   peoples at these distinct hydrological settings obtained more biomass
   from fishes and less from molluscs compared to the subsequent Savannah
   occupants. The two Swift Creek faunal collections are less rich, more
   diverse, and more equitable than the two subsequent Savannah collections
   regardless of location. Furthermore, the mean trophic level is higher in
   the Swift Creek collections compared to the Savannah ones at both
   locations. These observations apply to both biomass and Minimum Number
   of Individuals. These differences likely are defining characteristics
   distinguishing the Swift Creek and the Savannah economies. More research
   is needed to determine the extent to which these temporal and spatial
   patterns are attributable to environmental and cultural variables. (c)

AB Global extinction drivers, including habitat disturbance and climate
   change, are thought to affect larger species more than smaller species.
   However, it is unclear if such drivers interact to affect assemblage
   body size distributions. We asked how these two key global change
   drivers differentially affect the interspecific size distributions of
   ants, one of the most abundant and ubiquitous animal groups on earth. We
   also asked whether there is evidence of synergistic interactions and
   whether effects are related to species' trophic roles. We generated a
   global dataset on ant body size from 333 local ant assemblages collected
   by the authors across a broad range of climates and in disturbed and
   undisturbed habitats. We used head length (range: 0.22-4.55 mm) as a
   surrogate of body size and classified species to trophic groups. We used
   generalized linear models to test whether body size distributions
   changed with climate and disturbance, independent of species richness.
   Our analysis yielded three key results: 1) climate and disturbance
   showed independent associations with body size; 2) assemblages included
   more small species in warmer climates and fewer large species in wet
   climates; and 3) both the largest and smallest species were absent from
   disturbed ecosystems, with predators most affected in both cases. Our
   results indicate that temperature, precipitation and disturbance have
   differing effects on the body size distributions of local communities,
   with no evidence of synergistic interactions. Further, both large and

AB Several studies published over the last years suggest that the ability
   of many species to cope with global change will be closely related to
   the current amount of plasticity for fitness-related traits. Thus,
   disentangling general patterns in phenotypic flexibility, which could be
   then included in models aimed to predict changes in species
   distribution, represent a central goal in the current ecological agenda.
   The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) could be considered a timely
   and promising hypothesis since it provides an explicit link between
   climatic and geographic variables and phenotypic plasticity.
   Specifically, the CVH states that as the range of climatic fluctuation
   experienced by terrestrial animals increases with latitude, individuals
   at higher latitudes should present greater levels of phenotypic
   flexibility. Within this framework, here we evaluate the existence of
   latitudinal patterns in fat body size flexibility-estimated as the
   difference between maximum and minimum fat body size values observed
   throughout a year-for 59 lizard species, comprising the first evaluation
   of the CVH for a trait, other than thermic or metabolic characters, in
   ectothermic species. Conventional and phylogenetic analyses indicated a
   positive relationship between fat body size flexibility and latitude,
   and also between flexibility and temperature variability indexes.
   Together with previous findings our results suggest that: (1)
   latitudinal pattern for fitness-related traits, other than thermal
   characters, are beginning to emerge; (2) latitude is usually a better
   predictor of phenotypic plasticity than putative climatic variables; (3)
   hemispheric differences in climatic variability appears to be correlated
   with hemispheric differences in phenotypic plasticity.

AB From lizards to snakes, the trophic system of squamates exhibits at
   least six major modifications correlated with different feeding
   strategies. Beginning in lizards, these include 1) shift from tongue to
   jaws as the primary means of prey capture, accompanied by specialization
   of the tongue for chemoreception, and 2) increasing skull kineticism.
   These features continue into snakes along with 3) unilateral jaw
   displacement during swallowing accompanied by 4) increasing skull
   kineticism, 5) development of the cervical vertebrae into a lever system
   for launching the strike, 6) addition of sensory modalities
   (thermoreception) in some snakes, and in advanced snakes, 7) shift from
   mechanical to chemical means of predation. Many fundamental features
   elaborated into the highly kinematic and jaw-based feeding system of
   snakes actually appear first within lizards. However, the highly kinetic
   skull of snakes represents not so much an extrapolation of lizard
   kinesis, as it does a rebuilding, even redesign, of the skull to achieve
   its high level of kinesis.

AB Living (stained) benthic foraminiferal faunas were analyzed in 51
   surficial sediment samples taken from the northern Gulf of Cadiz
   continental shelf between the mouths of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir
   rivers. The distribution and abundance of 26 species with relative
   abundance >5% were related to water depth, sediment type, river
   discharge, water temperature, salinity, turbidity, and primary
   productivity. Hierarchical classification using R- and Q-mode cluster
   analyses, and individual distributions, allowed these taxa to be
   categorized into four general groups. Group 1 is represented by Bolivina
   ordinaria and Hopkinsina atlantica. These species are linked to river
   discharge, and are associated with muddy sediments. They are considered
   the most opportunistic species in the assemblage, and are associated
   with the limits of productivity. Group 2, contains Ammonia beccarii,
   Eggerelloides scaber, Elphidium gerthi, Quinqueloculina laevigata, and
   Q. stelligera, and is characteristic of shallow water depths. Its
   species are associated with different sediment types and their
   distribution is influenced by river discharge. Group 3 is dominated by
   Bulimina aculeata, B. elongata, Elphidium excavatum, E. cuvillieri,
   Epistominella vitrea, and Rectuvigerina phlegeri. These species display
   the highest abundances between 30-100 m water depths. They prevail in
   muds associated with weak hydrodynamics, low oxygenation, and high
   organic matter. Group 4 includes species that are more abundant in deep
   stations and is divided into two subgroups. Subgroup 4A includes
   Bolivina catanensis, B. italica, B. striatula, Cassidulina laevigata,
   Stainforthia sp., Nouria polymorphinoides, and Nouria sp., with higher
   abundances in one or two samples. Subgroup 4B, with Brizalina dilatata,
   B. spathulata, Bulimina marginata, Nonionella iridea, N. stella, and N.
   turgida, has patchy distribution. Higher abundances of Nonionella
   species off the Guadiana River are related to low temperature and
   salinity.

AB Living systems operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Enzymatic
   activity can induce broken detailed balance at the molecular scale. This
   molecular scale breaking of detailed balance is crucial to achieve
   biological functions such as high-fidelity transcription and
   translation, sensing, adaptation, biochemical patterning, and force
   generation. While biological systems such as motor enzymes violate
   detailed balance at the molecular scale, it remains unclear how
   non-equilibrium dynamics manifests at the mesoscale in systems that are
   driven through the collective activity of many motors. Indeed, in
   several cellular systems the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics is not
   always evident at large scales. For example, in the cytoskeleton or in
   chromosomes one can observe stationary stochastic processes that appear
   at first glance thermally driven. This raises the question how
   non-equilibrium fluctuations can be discerned from thermal noise. We
   discuss approaches that have recently been developed to address this
   question, including methods based on measuring the extent to which the
   system violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We also review
   applications of this approach to reconstituted cytoskeletal networks,
   the cytoplasm of living cells, and cell membranes. Furthermore, we
   discuss a more recent approach to detect actively driven dynamics, which
   is based on inferring broken detailed balance. This constitutes a
   non-invasive method that uses time-lapse microscopy data, and can be
   applied to a broad range of systems in cells and tissue. We discuss the
   ideas underlying this method and its application to several examples
   including flagella, primary cilia, and cytoskeletal networks. Finally,
   we briefly discuss recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and
   non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which offer new perspectives to
   understand the physics of living systems.

AB The green macroalgal species Caulerpa taxifolia is indigenous to
   tropical/subtropical Australia, ranging as far south as 28degrees and
   29degrees 15' S on the Australian mainland east and west coasts,
   respectively. The origin of disjunct populations of the species,
   discovered in 2000 on the Australian mainland east coast at localities
   to 35degrees S remains unknown, variously attributed to introduced
   exotic strains or range extensions from other eastern Australian
   populations. Some naturally occurring Australian populations of C.
   taxifolia are similar to Mediterranean C. taxifolia. In Australia, large
   broad forms of the species, which have been known in the region since
   1860, grow luxuriantly in sheltered seagrass meadows, with some of these
   populations tolerating minimum surface seawater temperatures in winter
   of 12.5 to 14.5degreesC. Accordingly, the contention that the
   Mediterranean has been invaded by a genetically-modified, large,
   cold-adapted strain of C. taxifolia may be incorrect. It is crucial that
   genetic markers (DNA fingerprinting, microsatellites) sensitive at the
   population level are used to accurately determine the genetic
   relatedness of C. taxifolia populations.

AB In the south of France, the so-called climate hiatus from 1998 to 2013
   was associated with a late winter cooling which has affected the
   phenology of several reptiles and amphibian species, delaying their
   dates of first appearances in spring. This episode has been related to a
   period of frequently negative values of the North Atlantic Oscillation
   index (NAO(i)). The recent increase of this index after this episode
   marks the end of the "hiatus" and provides an opportunity to verify the
   impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the fauna of the North
   Mediterranean region. Most of the emergence dates of amphibians and
   reptiles in spring have rapidly advanced from 1983 to 1997 and then
   receded or stabilized from 1998 to 2010. They began to advance again
   since 2010. These phenological changes covary with the temperature of
   February-March in the study area, which is itself related to the
   variations of the NAO index. These changes confirm the influence of the
   NAO on the phenology of terrestrial organisms in northern Mediterranean
   where its influence is sometimes assumed to be attenuated.

AB A long-standing challenge for population biology has been to understand
   why some species are characterized by populations that fluctuate in size
   independently, while populations of other species fluctuate
   synchronously across space. The effects of climatic variation and
   dispersal have been invoked to explain synchronous population dynamics,
   however an understanding of the relative influence of these drivers in
   natural populations is lacking. Here we compare support for
   dispersal-versus climate-driven models of interspecific variation in
   synchrony using 27 years of observations of 65 butterfly species at 10
   sites spanning 2750m of elevation in Northern California. The degree of
   spatial synchrony exhibited by each butterfly species was used as a
   response in a unique approach that allowed us to investigate whether
   interspecific variation in response to climate or dispersal propensity
   was most predictive of interspecific variation in synchrony. We report
   that variation in sensitivity to climate explained 50% of interspecific
   variation in synchrony, whereas variation in dispersal propensity
   explained 23%. Sensitivity to the El Nino Southern Oscillation, a
   primary driver of regional climate, was the best predictor of synchrony.
   Combining sensitivity to climate and dispersal propensity into a single
   model did not greatly increase model performance, confirming the primacy
   of climatic sensitivity for driving spatial synchrony in butterflies.
   Finally, we uncovered a relationship between spatial synchrony and
   population decline that is consistent with theory, but small in
   magnitude, which suggests that the degree to which populations fluctuate
   in synchrony is of limited use for understanding the ongoing decline of
   the Northern California butterfly fauna.

AB The copepod Acartia tonsa appeared in Europe in the first half of the
   20th century and colonized progressively European seas and estuaries,
   possibly transferred from North Atlantic Coast of America. It had been
   reported in the polyhaline area of the Gironde estuary for a long time
   but was first recorded in the oligo-mesohaline area in 1983. Its
   abundance has been increasing significantly. High abundances of A. tonsa
   were reported since 1999, supplanting the abundances of its
   autochthonous congeneric species, Acartia bifilosa. This colonization
   was characterized by analyzing the mean seasonal variability: (1) for
   three 5-year periods corresponding to three different steps of A. tonsa
   appearance (1978-1982, A. tonsa was absent; 1988-1992, low abundances of
   the species; and 1999-2003, high abundances of A. tonsa) in the
   oligo-mesohaline area and (2) for three stations distributed along the
   salinity gradient during the recent period. The aim of this work was to
   define if this colonization was due to natural or anthropogenic forcing
   and to evaluate its possible impact on autochthonous zooplanktonic
   community. Both natural and anthropogenic forcings seem to explain the
   colonization of Acartia tonsa in the oligo-mesohaline area of the
   Gironde estuary. First records (1983-1988) could be due to marine water
   inputs caused by high values of the North Atlantic Oscillation index.
   The global warming which caused the increase of the summer warm period,
   the marinisation of the system and the local decrease of the turbidity
   should have been the key factors favoring the establishment of the
   species. Anthropogenic forcings as the establishment of the nuclear
   power plant which locally causes warmer conditions are also important
   factors explaining the differences of seasonal cycle observed between
   oligo-mesohaline area and other stations: the seasonal pattern of A.
   tonsa in the oligo-mesohaline area was indeed characterized by an
   autumnal peak of abundances which has been observed in other stations
   and in many North European estuaries, and by a second spring peak that
   had only been observed in Southern estuaries.
   The introduction of Acartia tonsa in the Gironde estuary significantly
   changed the seasonal pattern of autochthonous copepods, by limiting
   their seasonal abundances without affecting their long-term population
   stability. Finally, the successful colonization of A. tonsa had led to
   the spread of the seasonal zooplanktonic production which could have had
   an impact on fish and shrimp productions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Neovolcanic Belt, and the species studied is Mexican mountain pine
   (Pinus hartwegii). Despite past logging in the area, 300 to 500-year old
   pines were found at 3600-3700 m elevation, about 300 m below the present
   treeline. The Nevado de Colima tree-ring chronology is well replicated
   from 1600 to 1997. Calibration with Colima climatic records points to
   summer monsoon precipitation as the strongest dendroclimatic signal.
   Most trees also exhibit extremely low growth in 1913 and 1914, following
   the January 1913 Plinian eruption of the Volcan de Colima. Because P,
   hartwegii is found on top of high mountains from Mexico to Guatemala,
   there is potential for developing a network of tropical treeline

AB Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) is a long-lived species widely distributed
   across the Mediterranean Basin, with potential value for
   dendrochronology and dendroclimatology. However, tree-ring dating in Q.
   ilex is a complex task that has limited the number of
   dendrochronological studies using this evergreen species. In the present
   work, it was investigated if old Q. ilex trees showed annual tree rings
   and whether they can be used as climate proxies. A long tree-ring
   chronology (126 years) of Q. ilex was developed using cross sections of
   20 trees from the Guadiana river basin (Portugal). The high correlation
   among tree-ring series suggested that tree growth was controlled mainly
   by climate. Response function analysis showed a positive correlation
   between tree-ring width and precipitation from October((t-1)) of the
   previous year to January((t)) of the current year and in May((t)).
   Tree-ring width was negatively correlated with the North Atlantic
   oscillation that exerts a strong influence on the precipitation over
   Iberia. Negative pointer years were triggered by dry years and became
   more frequent during the last decade of the 20th century. In conclusion,
   it is possible to accurately date old Q. ilex trees, and their tree
   rings could be used for climate reconstructions across the
   Mediterranean.

AB The present study explored the effects of mixture of avermectin and
   imidacloprid on the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and mortality of
   Copera annulata larvae. The results showed that the mortality of larval
   damselflies treated with different concentrations of insecticide did not
   differ significantly. However, we found that the levels of FA of two
   traits were significantly different with different treatments but the
   others did not show any differences. Explicitly, FA of two traits
   increased with increasing pesticide concentration. There was a
   significantly negative relationship between first femur length and the
   absolute difference between its right and left sides. There was no
   relationship with respect to the absolute difference between the right
   and left sides of all traits and their body size. FA was not associated
   with mortality. Our results emphasized that insecticide had potential
   effects on bilaterally symmetrical traits of damselfly larvae, although
   they were no longer treated with insecticide during the last rearing.

AB The climate regime in the eastern Bering Sea has recently been dominated
   by a pattern of multi-year stanzas, in which several successive years of
   minimal sea-ice formation and warm summer temperatures (e.g., 2002-2005,
   2014-2017) alternate with several years of relatively extensive sea-ice
   formation and cold summer temperatures (e.g., 2006-2013). This emerging
   climate pattern may be forcing long-term changes in the spatial
   distributions of the Bering Sea's marine fauna. The National Marine
   Fisheries Service's Alaska Fisheries Science Center recently conducted
   two bottom trawl surveys covering the entire Bering Sea shelf from the
   Alaska Peninsula to the Bering Strait. The first, in the summer of 2010,
   was conducted during a cold year when the majority of the continental
   shelf was covered by a pool of cold (<2 degrees C) water. The second, in
   the summer of 2017, was during a warmer year with water temperatures
   above the long-term survey mean. These two surveys recorded
   significantly different spatial distributions for populations of several
   commercially important fish species, including walleye pollock (Gadus
   chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and several flatfish
   species, as well as jellyfishes. Population shifts included latitudinal
   displacement as well as variable recruitment success. The large-scale
   distributional shifts reported here for high-biomass species raise
   questions about long-term ecosystem impacts, and highlight the need for
   continued monitoring. They also raise questions about our management
   strategies for these and other species in Alaska's large marine
   ecosystems.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of whole body
   cryotherapy (WBC) on a range of thermoregulatory measures. We also
   sought to examine the influence of sex and body composition. A
   convenience sample of 18 healthy participants (10 males and 8 females)
   (27 +/- 6 yr) volunteered for this study. Temperature (core, tympanic,
   skin and mean body), heart rate, blood pressure, and thermal comfort and
   sensation were recorded pre- and post- (immediately and every 5 min
   until 35 min post) exposure to a single bout of WBC (30 s at-60 degrees
   C, 150 s at 110 degrees C). Anthropometric data (height, weight, body
   surface area, body mass index, fat mass and fat free mass) were also
   recorded. No significant differences in temperature (core, tympanic,
   skin and mean body), heart rate, blood pressure, or thermal comfort /
   sensation were observed between male and females at baseline.
   Immediately post WBC mean body (male:31.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C; female:31.0
   +/- 0.9 degrees C; Delta mean body temperature:0.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C; P
   <= 0.05, d=0.64) and mean skin (male:22.1 +/- 2.2 degrees C; female:19.6
   +/- 2.8 degrees C; Delta mean skin temperature:-2.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C;
   d=0.99, P <= 0.05) temperature was significantly different between
   sexes. Sex differences were also observed in regional skin temperature
   (male thigh, 20.8 1.1 degrees C; female thigh, 16.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C, A
   mean thigh skin temperature:-4.1 degrees C; d=3.72; male calf, 20.5 1.1
   degrees C; female calf, 18.2 1 degrees C, A mean calf skin
   temperature:-2.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C; d=3.61; male arm, 21.7 +/- 1 degrees
   C; female arm, 19 0.4 degrees C, A mean arm skin temperature:-2.7 0.3
   degrees C; d=3.54; P <= 0.05). Mean arterial pressure was significantly
   different over time (P <= 0.001) and between sexes (male 0 mins:94 +/-
   10 mmHg; female 0 mins:85 7 mmHg; male 35 mins:88 7 mmHg; female 35
   mins:80 6 mmHg; P <= 0.05). Combined data set indicated a strong
   negative relationship between skin temperature and body fat percentage
   35 min' post WBC (r=-0.749, P <= 0.001) and for core temperature and
   body mass index in males only (r=0.726, P <= 0.05) immediately after
   WBC. There were no significant differences between sexes in any other
   variables (heart rate, tympanic and perceptual variables). We observed
   sex differences in mean skin and mean body temperature following
   exposure to whole body cryotherapy. In an attempt to optimise treatment,
   these differences should be taken into account if whole body cryotherapy
   is prescribed.

AB A Just-Pope production function is employed to investigate the effects
   of historic weather changes on hard red spring wheat yield variability
   in Manitoba. Field-level data on wheat yield, proportion of wheat seeded
   area, and fertilizer inputs from the Manitoba Agricultural Services
   Corporation were employed to determine how temperature and precipitation
   affect mean wheat yield and production risk, and how projected climate
   scenarios impact yield variability in heterogeneous risk areas of
   Manitoba. Variety richness increases average yield and reduces yield
   variance while varieties protected by plant breeders' rights increase
   yield variance. Phosphorus fertilizer is positively associated with
   average wheat yield while total precipitation is shown to negatively
   affect mean yield and positively impact yield variability. June
   precipitation matters while June and July temperatures negatively affect
   yield. Projected climate change is expected to increase yield
   variability in both the medium (2034-2050) and long term (2079-2095),
   both under low- and high-carbon scenarios with production variance
   effects differing across crop districts. Adaptation strategies may be
   required to mitigate yield risk effects of climate change resulting in
   late seeding decisions from increased spring precipitation.

AB The effects of diet on life-history traits were compared among
   individual webworms reared on an artificial diet or the leaves of two
   host plants in a trivoltine population of Hyphantria clinea collected in
   Kobe, Japan. The lower threshold temperature for development and the
   thermal constant among one generation did not differ largely according
   to the diets. There were two variations in the larval instar numbers,
   those being the six- or seven-instar type. The incidence of the
   seven-instar type fed the artificial diet was significantly lower than
   those fed on the host plants. The pupal weight for the six-instar type
   was significantly heavier for those fed the artificial diet than those
   fed on the host plants. Seasonal host plant effects were detected in
   some developmental traits. The critical photoperiods for diapause
   induction at 20 and 25 degrees C were similar between the host plants,
   and were shorter with the artificial diet than with the host plants. The
   present results suggest that the data for the artificial diet need not
   be modified in the parameters for the developmental rate, but that the
   critical photoperiod for diapause induction needs to be slightly
   lengthened when the data are applied to field insects.

AB The abundance and spatial distribution of mesozooplankton were compared
   in the euhaline region of the polluted Bilbao estuary and the
   unperturbed Urdaibai estuary. The environmental variables measured were
   salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen saturation, chlorophyll a,
   particulate organic matter and Secchi disk depth. Differences in the
   environmental variables and zooplankton between the estuaries and within
   the estuaries were tested statistically. Differences in the patterns of
   mesozooplankton abundance with salinity in each estuary indicated that
   they were affected by pollution in the Bilbao. Total mesozooplankton,
   and several mesozooplankton categories were more abundant in the Bilbao
   at higher salinities but in the Urdaibai at lower salinities. Therefore,
   we deduced that, in the Bilbao, zooplankton abundance was enhanced by
   the moderate pollution at the outer euhaline zone and limited by the
   poorer conditions of the inner zone. The response of the various
   zooplankton categories to the pollution is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB Coral reefs within 10 degrees of the equator generally experience <= 3
   degrees C seasonal variation in water temperature. Ectotherms that have
   evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow
   thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability
   (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The
   impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution
   of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we
   examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on
   their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year
   round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct
   genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6
   degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important
   indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees
   C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes
   varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available
   for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45% in five species and
   three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was
   reduced by 17% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical
   swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode
   predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42% in six species
   spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and
   across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were
   strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy
   habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents
   year round, and >95% of individuals were observed only in habitats where
   the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat
   currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce
   performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera
   within and among coral reef habitats. Ultimately, thermal variability
   across latitudes may progressively cause sublethal changes to species
   performance and lead to a contraction of biogeographical range.

AB Positive sap pressures are produced in the xylem of birch trees in
   boreal conditions during the time between the thawing of the soil and
   bud break. During this period, xylem embolisms accumulated during
   wintertime are refilled with water. The mechanism for xylem sap
   pressurization and its environmental drivers are not well known. We
   measured xylem sap flow, xylem sap pressure, xylem sap osmotic
   concentration, xylem and whole stem diameter changes, and stem and root
   non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, along with meteorological
   conditions at two sites in Finland during and after the sap
   pressurisation period. The diurnal dynamics of xylem sap pressure and
   sap flow during the sap pressurisation period varied, but were more
   often opposite to the diurnal pattern after bud burst, i.e. sap pressure
   increased and sap flow rate mostly decreased when temperature increased.
   Net conversion of soluble sugars to starch in the stem and roots
   occurred during the sap pressurisation period. Xylem sap osmotic
   pressure was small in comparison to total sap pressure, and it did not
   follow changes in environmental conditions or tree water relations.
   Based on these findings, we suggest that xylem sap pressurisation and
   embolism refilling occur gradually over a few weeks through water
   transfer from parenchyma cells to xylem vessels during daytime, and then
   the parenchyma are refilled mostly during nighttime by water uptake from
   soil. Possible drivers for water transfer from parenchyma cells to
   vessels are discussed. Also the functioning of thermal dissipation
   probes in conditions of changing stem water content is discussed.

AB Many birds exhibit considerable phenotypic flexibility in metabolism to
   maintain thermoregulation or to conserve energy. This flexibility
   usually includes seasonal variation in metabolic rate. Seasonal changes
   in physiology and behavior of birds are considered to be a part of their
   adaptive strategy for survival and reproductive success. House Sparrows
   (Passer domesticus) are small passerines from Europe that have been
   successfully introduced to many parts of the world, and thus may be
   expected to exhibit high phenotypic flexibility in metabolic rate. Mass
   specific Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
   were significantly higher in winter compared with summer, although there
   was no significant difference between body mass in summer and winter. A
   similar, narrow thermal neutral zone (25-28 degrees C) was observed in
   both seasons. Winter elevation of metabolic rate in House Sparrows was
   presumably related to metabolic or morphological adjustments to meet the
   extra energy demands of cold winters. Overall, House Sparrows showed
   seasonal metabolic acclimatization similar to other temperate wintering
   passerines. The improved cold tolerance was associated with a
   significant increase in VO2 in winter relative to summer. In addition,
   some summer birds died at 5 degrees C, whereas winter birds did not,
   further showing seasonal variation in cold tolerance. The increase in
   BMR of 120% in winter, compared to summer, is by far the highest
   recorded seasonal change so far in birds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Total soil respiration (R-ToT) and its components fluxes: autotrophic
   respiration (R-A) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H) need to be
   quantified because they are an important process contributing 60-80% of
   all ecosystem respiration.Although R-ToT is influenced by many
   environmental factors, the main controlling factors are soil temperature
   and soil moisture content.The relationship between R-ToT and soil
   temperature is usually described using an exponential function. However,
   a wide variety of soil moisture content-response functions have been
   proposed. This underlines the large variability observed between soil
   and site types and the need for more investigation. Four paired plots
   were established in a beech plantation in south-west Ireland. In each
   pair, one plot was trenched and the other remained undisturbed. Soil
   respiration was measured at weekly or fortnightly intervals throughout
   2010 using an infrared gas analyser. At the same time, soil temperature
   and soil moisture content in the top 5cm were measured manually and also
   logged at 30-min intervals. Simple and multiple nonlinear regression
   analyses were used to examine relationships between soil respiration,
   soil temperature and soil moisture content. Soil respiration showed a
   seasonal trend that was regulated by soil temperature.The multiplicative
   combined models developed support the hypothesis that the effect of soil
   temperature on soil respiration was dependent on changes in soil
   moisture content. Maximum soil respiration occurred when the soil
   moisture content was at field capacity (soil moisture content of 31%)
   and mean annual R-H and R-A were 1,700 and 892g CO2 m(-2) y(-1),
   respectively. Mean RA represented 34% of Rior The inclusion of some soil
   physical properties (soil organic carbon, bulk density and pH) in soil
   respiration models could help to explain the spatial variability of soil
   CO2 efflux at a site level and to improve the annual soil CO2 emissions.

AB Habitability is a widely used word in the geoscience, planetary science,
   and astrobiology literature, but what does it mean? In this review on
   habitability, we define it as the ability of an environment to support

   definition of habitability and a habitable environment. An environment
   either can or cannot sustain a given organism. However, environments
   such as entire planets might be capable of supporting more or less
   species diversity or biomass compared with that of Earth. A clarity in
   understanding habitability can be obtained by defining instantaneous
   habitability as the conditions at any given time in a given environment
   required to sustain the activity of at least one known organism, and
   continuous planetary habitability as the capacity of a planetary body to
   sustain habitable conditions on some areas of its surface or within its
   interior over geological timescales. We also distinguish between surface
   liquid water worlds (such as Earth) that can sustain liquid water on
   their surfaces and interior liquid water worlds, such as icy moons and
   terrestrial-type rocky planets with liquid water only in their
   interiors. This distinction is important since, while the former can
   potentially sustain habitable conditions for oxygenic photosynthesis
   that leads to the rise of atmospheric oxygen and potentially complex
   multicellularity and intelligence over geological timescales, the latter
   are unlikely to. Habitable environments do not need to contain life.
   Although the decoupling of habitability and the presence of life may be
   rare on Earth, it may be important for understanding the habitability of
   other planetary bodies. Key Words:

AB We studied the ability of the Antarctic fish Notothenia neglecta to
   conduct an induced inflammatory process at 0 degrees C. Indian ink was
   injected and a cotton suture thread was implanted into muscle of
   different groups of fish. After 1-2 days of Indian ink injection, the
   ink was diffused in the perimysium and there was hemorrhage and cellular
   infiltrate composed mainly of macrophages A (with few and small
   lysosomes) and neutrophils; after 7-15 days, there were macrophages A
   and some macrophages B (cytoplasm clear, lamellar cytoplasmic system
   forming interdigitations); after 30 days, there was Indian ink in the
   interior of macrophages A. The suture thread process takes place in two
   phases: the first (up to 7 days) with predominance of macrophages A and
   few neutrophils, and the second (15-30 days) with predominance of
   macrophages B. It can be concluded that N. neglecta is responsive to
   irritant stimulus with inflammatory process indicating adaptation to the
   antarctic environment.

AB In Hemilepistus reaumuri (Audouin, 1826), a monogamous desert isopod,
   control of reproduction by external factors is studied in females from a
   Tunisian population. In the wild, females perform only one brood (in
   May). In contrast to isopods submitted to temperate climates (long day
   species), H. reaumuri is unsensitive to photoperiod. Onset of
   reproduction is dependent on temperature: it occurs only when
   temperature is higher than 15 degrees C (between 15 degrees C and 20
   degrees C). Moreover, at 25 degrees C, the lag time of the onset of
   reproduction is shortened by 50% in comparison with the delay obtained
   at 20 degrees C. Whereas an isolated female remains in sexual rest, the
   presence of a male (even separated from the female by a wire netting)
   speeds up vitellogenesis following by moult. The beginning of burrow
   digging is well correlated with the initiation of reproduction (second
   phase of vitellogenesis).

AB Although wild annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is indigenous to
   North America, it has been both inadvertently and intentionally
   introduced into other countries, such as Australia, where it has become
   naturalized. Prior to this research, there were no collections of
   naturalized H. annuus from Australia in the USDA National Plant
   Germplasm System gene bank. The possibility exists that naturalized
   Australian populations may contain distinct traits, such as oil content
   and fatty-acid composition, differing from their North American
   progenitors due to the different environments, diseases, and insect-pest
   complexes. The objective of this study was to collect naturalized H.
   annuus populations from the five states of Australia and to analyze them
   for oil content and fatty-acid composition. Fifty-six populations were
   collected throughout the broad distributional range of this species and
   then analyzed for oil content and fatty-acid composition. The mean oil
   content of the H. annuus populations was 28%, ranging from a low of 19%
   to a high of 31%, similar to populations of this species in its native
   North American habitats. Fatty-acid profiles were also similar for North
   American wild populations, Australian naturalized populations, and
   improved cultivars. Oil concentration of hybrids can be rapidly
   increased to acceptable levels by backcrossing with cultivated
   sunflower. Based on this fact, there should be little concern about the
   relatively low oil content of these naturalized populations when they
   are used as a source of other unique traits for cultivated sunflower
   improvement.

AB Wide-compatibility varieties (WCVs) are a special class of rice
   germplasm that is able to produce fertile hybrids when crossed to both
   indica and japonica subspecies. Previous studies determined 'Dular' and
   02428 as two WCVs and identified a number of QTLs as having large
   effects on fertility of inter-subspecific hybrids. In this study, we
   developed five near-isogenic lines (NILs) for three of the QTLs, f5, f6
   and S5, by backcrossing and marker-assisted selection, using 'Dular' and
   02428 as the donors and 'Zhenshan 97' as the recipient. Three of the
   NILs each carried one introgressed allele, and two NILs each carried two
   introgressed alleles in combinations. The NILs were testcrossed to an
   indica tester 'Nanjing 11' and a japonica tester 'Balilla'. The results
   showed that the f5 allele from 'Dular' (f5-Du) is a neutral allele
   conferring wide compatibility, with a large effect on both pollen and
   spikelet fertility, and the f6 allele from 'Dular' (f6-Du) is a neutral
   allele for spikelet fertility with smaller effect. The S5 allele from
   02428 (S5-08) was confirmed to be a neutral allele for spikelet
   fertility. It is likely that f6 and S5 are the same locus as deduced by
   their genomic locations and effects. The results also showed that even
   in combination, two neutral alleles of different loci were not able to
   produce normal fertility hybrids in typical indica-japonica crosses. The
   implications of the findings in rice breeding programs are discussed.

AB Precipitation and mean temperature trends at monthly, seasonal and

   out if these tendencies differ from those pointed out for this region in
   a previous research for the period 1961-1997 and to establish, based on
   bioclimatic models, possible changes on the potential natural vegetation
   of this territory if these trends do not change in future. Magnitude of
   trends was derived from the slopes of the regression lines while the
   statistical significance was determined by the Mann-Kendall test.
   Magnitude and sign of rainfall and temperature trends over the last four
   decades have been essentially the same than those concerning to the
   period 1961-1997. It can be concluded that if these trends keep in
   future areas with temperate climate could increase in this region. In
   this situation, deciduous forests could extend their distribution
   limits, thus replacing some semi-deciduous and evergreen ones.

AB We investigated body-size inheritance in interspecific sterile hybrids
   by crossing a Drosophila simulans strain with 13 strains of Drosophila
   melanogaster, which were of various origins and chosen for their broad
   range of genetic variation. A highly significant parent-offspring
   correlation was observed, showing that the D. melanogaster genes for
   size are still expressed in a hybrid background. Superimposed on to this
   additive inheritance, the size of hybrids was always less than the
   mid-parent value. This phenomenon, which at first sight might be
   described as dominance or overdominance, is more precisely interpreted
   as a consequence of a hybrid breakdown, that is, a dysfunction of the
   parental genes for size when put to work together. This interpretation
   is enforced by the fact that phenotypic variability was much more
   prevalent in hybrids than in parents. We also analysed body pigmentation
   inheritance in the same crosses and got a very different picture. There
   was no increase in the phenotypic variance of F, hybrids and only a low
   parent-offspring correlation. Apparent overdominance could be observed
   but in opposite directions, with no evidence of hybrid breakdown. Our
   data point to the possibility of analysing a diversity of quantitative
   traits in interspecific hybrids, and indicate that breakdown might be
   restricted to some traits only.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration has been shown to increase rice
   yield but its effect on plant lodging resistance is still under debate.
   In this study, we examined lodging incidence in the field and
   lodging-related traits of two rice cultivarswith contrasting lodging
   susceptibility under ambient and elevated CO2 (ca. 200 mu mol mol(-1)
   above ambient) concentrations by using a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)
   system. Elevated CO2 (E-CO2) increased lodging resistance as shown by
   reduced visual lodging incidence in the field at the late grain filling
   stage in E-CO2 plots. This coincided with enhanced in situ pushing
   resistance of intact plants one week before lodging occurred. The
   positive CO2 effect was more pronounced in the lodging-susceptible
   cultivar LY084. In contrast, the cultivar WYJ23 displayed greater
   pushing resistance in the field, and no lodging occurred at either
   ambient or elevated CO2 conditions through out the cropping season. The
   field observations were consistent with the physicochemical
   characterization of basal internodes of rice plants at the grain filling
   stage. Greater lodging resistance of WYJ23 was mainly attributed to its
   shorter plant height and thicker culm wall of basal internodes. The
   improvement of lodging resistance by E-CO2 for the lodging-susceptible
   cultivar LY084 was mainly related to enhanced culm density, which was
   explained by elevated starch deposition in the stem. Less lodging
   incidence under elevated CO2 contributed to an increase in grain yield
   by 36% for LY084. In conclusion, rice production could benefit from
   elevated CO2 in a changing climate because of an increase in lodging
   resistance as a result of CO2-induced improvements in mechanical
   strength of basal internodes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Tree-ring-width chronology of Betula ermanii was developed at the
   timberline (2,400 m a.s.l.) on Mount Norikura in central Japan, and
   climatic factors affecting the tree-ring width of B. ermanii were
   examined. Three monthly climatic data (mean temperature, insolation
   duration, and sum of precipitation) were used for the analysis. The
   tree-ring width of B. ermanii was (n)egatively correlated with the
   December and January temperatures and with the January precipitation
   prior to the growth. However, why high temperatures and heavy snow in
   winter had negative effects on the growth of B. ermanii is unknown. The
   tree-ring width was positively correlated with Summer temperatures
   during June-August of the current year. The tree-ring width was also
   positively correlated with the insolation duration in July of the
   Current year. fit contrast, the tree-ring width was negatively
   correlated with summer precipitation during July-September Of the
   Current year. However, these negative correlations Of Summer
   precipitation do not seem to be independent of temperature and
   insolation duration, i.e., substantial precipitation reduces the
   insolation duration and temperature. Therefore, it is suggested that
   significant insolation duration and high temperature due to less
   precipitation in si,,er of the current year increase the radial growth
   of B. ermanii at the timberline. The results were also compared with
   those Of Our previous study conducted at the lower altitudinal limit of
   B. ermanii (approximately 1,600 m a.s.l.) on Mount Norikura. This Study
   suggests that the climatic factors that increase the radial growth or B.
   ermanii differ between its Upper and lower altitudinal limits.

AB Insects exposed to low temperature stress can experience chill injury,
   but incorporating fluctuating thermoprofiles increases survival and
   blocks the development of sub-lethal effects. The specific parameters
   required for a protective thermoprofile are poorly understood, because
   most studies test a limited range of thermoprofiles. For example,
   thermoprofiles with a wave profile may perform better than a square
   profile, but these two profiles are rarely compared. In this study, two
   developmental stages of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata, eye-pigmented pupae, and emergence-ready adults, were exposed
   to one of eight thermoprofiles for up to 8 weeks. All the thermoprofiles
   had a base of 6 degrees C and a peak temperature of either 12 degrees C
   or 18 degrees C. The duration at peak temperature varied depending on
   the shape of the thermoprofile, either square or wave form. Two other
   treatments acted as controls, a constant 6 degrees C and a fluctuating
   thermal regime (FTR) with a base temperature of 6 degrees C that was
   interrupted daily by a single, 1-h pulse at 20 degrees C. Compared with
   constant 6 degrees C, all the test thermoprofiles significantly improved
   survival. Compared with the FTR control, the thermoprofiles with a peak
   temperature of 18 degrees C outperformed the 12 degrees C profiles. Bees
   in the eye-pigmented stage exposed to the 18 degrees C profiles
   separated into two groups based on the shape of the profile, with higher
   survival in the square profiles compared with the wave profiles. Bees in
   the emergence-ready stage exposed to 18 degrees C profiles all had
   significantly higher survival than bees in the FTR controls. Counter to
   expectations, the least ecologically relevant thermoprofiles (square)
   had the highest survival rates and blocked the development of sub-lethal
   effects (delayed emergence).

   habitat are alternatively pounded by waves and exposed to thermal
   extremes during low tide periods (Denny and Wethey, 2001). Additionally,
   they, must deal with strong selective pressures related to predation and
   competition for space (Connell, 1961). As a result, the steep physical
   gradient and spatially condensed community has made the rocky intertidal
   zone an ideal "natural laboratory" to study the coupled role of physical
   and biological factors in determining the abundance and distribution of

AB Environmental variability is on the rise in different parts of the
   earth, and the survival of many species depends on how well they cope
   with these fluctuations. Our current understanding of how organisms
   adapt to unpredictably fluctuating environments is almost entirely based
   on studies that investigate fluctuations among different values of a
   single environmental stressor such as temperature or pH. How would
   unpredictability affect adaptation when the environment fluctuates
   between qualitatively very different kinds of stresses? To answer this
   question, we subjected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli to
   selection over similar to 260 generations. The populations faced
   predictable and unpredictable environmental fluctuations across
   qualitatively different selection environments, namely, salt and acidic
   pH. We show that predictability of environmental fluctuations does not
   play a role in determining the extent of adaptation, although the extent
   of ancestral adaptation to the chosen selection environments is of key
   importance.

AB The simulation of biological membranes over length and time scales
   relevant to cellular biology is not currently feasible using
   conventional (fully atomic or molecularly detailed) simulation
   strategies. Given the wide disparity between what is possible on today's
   computers and the problems one might like to study, it seems unlikely
   this situation will change for several decades. An appealing alternative
   to traditional computational approaches is to employ simpler,
   continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity
   theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Although such models
   have seen wide use in analytical descriptions of membrane behavior, the
   extension of these methods to more general situations and numerical
   analysis is just beginning to be explored. This article reviews
   continuum models for membrane behavior with an emphasis on the use of
   such models in computational studies. Two applications are explored to
   demonstrate the utility of this level of coarse-grained modeling.

AB The purpose of this paper was to study the community structure, in terms
   of species composition, abundance and spatial distribution, of fish
   larvae in a wide coastal area of Sicily facing the Southeastern
   Tyrrhenian Sea, extending for 2300 km(2) from Cape Cefalu to the west,
   to Cape Rasocolmo in the east. This study analyses how species are
   assembled in relation to an inshore-offshore gradient and also how
   environmental conditions, determined by surface circulation patterns
   occurring in the Central Mediterranean at the local scale, determine the
   distribution patterns. Samples from 39 stations were collected using a
   60-cm Bongo net during an ichthyoplanktonic survey carried out in June
   2006. In all, 62 taxa, representing 32 families, were identified.
   Cyclothone braueri (59.6%), Engraulis encrasicolus (9.2%) Lampanyctus
   crocodilus (4.3%) and Lampanyctus pusillus (4.1%) were the most abundant
   species. The results showed that the highest abundance value (14830.6
   fish larvae per 10 m(2) sea surface) was observed in the western part of
   the study area. MDS, SIMPER and CCA analyses revealed well defined
   groups of stations and assemblages of larvae in accordance with an
   inshore-offshore gradient. The results of this study could have
   implications for the management of marine resources because the
   investigated area has already been identified as a nursery area for many
   pelagic and coastal fishes and a natural habitat for many species of
   high commercial interest.

AB Laying date is one of the most important determinants of reproductive
   success and recruitment probability in birds. Late breeders usually
   fledge fewer chicks than individuals with earlier breeding dates, and
   fledglings produced late in the season have high mortality rates. Food
   availability and nestling mass have been evoked as the principal
   mechanistic links between laying date and offspring survival. Here we
   suggest that aa another factor may actually account for the difference
   in survival rate between early and late offspring: immunocompetence. We
   predicted that nestlings produced later in the season or in replacement
   clutches should have lower immune responses when challenged with an
   antigen, than early nestlings or nestlings produced in first clutches.
   This hypothesis was tested in a population of magpies (Pica pica), in
   which we experimentally induced breeding failure in a group of nests and
   compared the immune response of nestlings in replacement clutches with
   the immune response of first clutch nestlings. Cellular immune response,
   as measured by wing web swelling (a correlate of T-lymphocyte production
   after injection of phytohaemagglutinin-P), significantly decreased with
   hatching date and was significantly lower in nestlings of replacement
   clutches. Furthermore, coefficients of intraclutch variation in immune
   response were higher in nestlings of replacement clutches. This
   experiment demonstrates an inverse relationship between immune
   responsiveness and breeding date, and reduced recruitment probability of
   late nestlings may-be a direct consequence of their inability to cope
   with parasites.

AB Most animals that possess potent venom display a wide variety of warning
   messages to discourage predators. Tiger snakes are large and highly
   venomous elapids that exhibit these anti-predator behaviours. We
   compared the anti-predator behaviours of two neighbouring and
   genetically indistinguishable populations in Western Australia (Herdsman
   Lake, HL and Carnac Island, CI). CI is free from human, native and feral
   predation. All of these factors represent a continual threat on HL
   situated on the mainland. Neither body size, nor sex influenced
   defensive behaviours. However, we observed a marked inter-population
   difference among adults in the degree to which anti-predator behaviours
   were displayed when snakes were continually aggravated: HL snakes
   exhibited a typical warning signal (flat-neck) and bite, while CI snakes
   remained very docile. In stark contrast, neonates of both populations
   exhibited marked anti-predator behaviours and both populations were
   indistinguishable in terms of the intensity of display. Neonates reared
   in captivity, hence regularly confronted by human predators, became more
   defensive in comparison with neonates exposed to natural conditions on
   CI; similarly several adult CI snakes kept in captivity became more
   defensive. Our results highlight the extreme behavioural plasticity of
   snakes. We also hypothesize that CI snakes may become more placid over
   time as they grow up in an environment free from predation.

AB A method for simulating the growth of branched actin networks against
   obstacles has been developed. The method is based on simple stochastic
   events, including addition or removal of monomers at filament ends,
   capping of filament ends, nucleation of branches from existing
   filaments, and detachment of branches; the network structure for several
   different models of the branching process has also been studied. The
   models differ with regard to their inclusion of effects such as
   preferred branch orientations, filament uncapping at the obstacle, and
   preferential branching at filament ends. The actin ultrastructure near
   the membrane in lamellipodia is reasonably well produced if preferential
   branching in the direction of the obstacle or barbed-end uncapping
   effects are included. Uncapping effects cause the structures to have a
   few very long filaments that are similar to those seen in
   pathogen-induced "actin tails." The dependence of the growth velocity,
   branch spacing, and network density on the rate parameters for the
   various processes is quite different among the branching models. An
   analytic theory of the growth velocity and branch spacing of the network
   is described. Experiments are suggested that could distinguish among
   some of the branching models.

AB Global transcriptome analyses were used to assess the interactive
   effects of short-term stress versus long-term acclimation to high light
   (HL), low temperature (LT) and excitation pressure in Arabidopsis.
   Microarray analyses indicated that exposure to stress resulted in two
   times as many modulated transcripts in both, high-light-treated and
   low-temperature-treated plants, compared to plants that were fully
   acclimated to either one of these conditions. We showed that 10.9 % of
   all transcripts were regulated in the same way by both stress
   conditions, and hence, were categorized as excitation pressure
   regulated, rather than regulated by either high-light or low-temperature
   stress per se. This group of chloroplast redox-sensitive genes included
   various photosynthetic genes as well as genes known to be associated
   with cold acclimation (cbf3, cor15A, cor15B) and gibberellic acid (GA)
   metabolism and signalling (ga2ox1, gai). Chemical inhibition of the
   photosynthetic electron transport by either DCMU or DBMIB indicated that
   although the plastoquinone pool contributes significantly to redox
   regulation of the transcriptome (8.6 %), it appears that PSI represents
   the major source of redox signals (89 %), whereas PSII appears to
   contribute only 3.1 %. A comparison of the gene expression profiles
   between stress and acclimated plants indicated that 10 % of the genes
   induced by a short, 1-h stress were also associated with long-term
   acclimation to high excitation pressure. This included the
   APETALA2/ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE-BINDING PROTEIN family, the MYB domain- and
   MYB-related transcription factor family as well as the GRAS
   transcription factor family important in GA signalling confirming that
   acclimation to stress is a time-nested phenomenon. We suggest that
   acclimation to photosynthetic redox imbalance extends beyond the
   chloroplast and the leaf cell to systemic ROS signalling. This is
   discussed in terms of the control of plant phenotype through regulation
   of the nuclear encoded cbf regulon and GA metabolism.

AB A negative correlation exists between environmental temperature and
   cancer risk based on both epidemiological and statistical analyses.
   Previously, cold stress was reported to be an effective cause of
   tumorigenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that cold temperature
   serves as a potential risk factor in cancer development. Most recently,
   a link was demonstrated between the effects of extreme cold climate on
   cancer incidence, pinpointing its impact on tumour suppressor genes by
   causing mutation. The underlying mechanism behind cold stress and its
   association with tumorigenesis is not well understood. Hence, this
   review intends to shed light on the role of associated factors, genetic
   and/or non-genetic, which are modulated by cold temperature, and
   eventually influence tumorigenic potential. While scrutinizing the
   effect of cold exposure on the body, the expression of certain genes,
   e.g. uncoupled proteins and heat-shock proteins, were elevated.
   Biological chemicals such as norepinephrine, thyroxine, and cholesterol
   were also elevated. Brown adipose tissue, which plays an essential role
   in thermogenesis, displayed enhanced activity upon cold exposure.
   Adaptive measures are utilized by the body to tolerate the cold, and in
   doing so, invites both epigenetic and genetic changes. Unknowingly,
   these adaptive strategies give rise to a lethal outcome i.e., genesis of
   cancer. Concisely, this review attempts to draw a link between cold
   stress, genetic and epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis and aspires to
   ascertain the mechanism behind cold temperature-mediated cancer risk.

AB We experimentally induced different levels of instability affecting the
   development of specific wing regions of Drosophila melanogaster using
   the UAS-GAL4 system. A common index of developmental instability is
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA), that is, random differences between body
   sides of single individuals. We studied the FA in transgenic strains
   carrying random genomic insertions (UAS strains), as well as insertions
   in the regulatory region of genes involved in the organization of wing
   development (GAL4 strains). In addition, the expression of genes that
   increase (dp110 and 3622) or decrease (dPTEN) cell proliferation was
   ectopically induced. Our results are related to different levels of
   perturbation. Through the first kind of perturbation, genome integrity
   was compromised by the insertion of foreign DNA. In all cases, we
   observed a general increase in FA, although it was rarely found
   significant. The second kind of perturbation involved a modification of
   genes controlling wing development through the insertion of a GAL4
   sequence in their promoter region. The third kind involved the ectopic
   expression of genes controlling cell proliferation. Our results show
   that (i) the level of FA is connected with the level of morphological
   perturbation induced, (ii) FA increase was higher in the wing regions
   that were the target of the genetic perturbation, and (iii)
   developmental instability was also observed in regions that were not
   directly addressed by the perturbation. The results were discussed on
   the basis of the running models about Drosophila wing development.

AB Adverse cardiovascular events are known to exhibit 24-h variations with
   a peak incidence in the morning hours and a nonuniform distribution
   during the night. The authors examined whether these 24-h variations
   could be related to circadian or sleep-related changes in heart rate
   (HR) and in HR variability (HRV). To differentiate the effect of
   circadian and sleep-related influences, independent of posture and of
   meal ingestion, seven normal subjects were studied over 24 h, once with
   nocturnal sleep from 2300 to 0700 h and once after a night of sleep
   deprivation followed by 8 h of daytime sleep from 0700 to 1500 h. The
   subjects were submitted to constant conditions (continuous enteral
   nutrition and bed rest). HRV was calculated every 5 min using two
   indexes: the standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and the
   ratio of low-frequency to low-frequency plus high-frequency power. Sleep
   processes exerted a predominant influence on the 24-h profiles of HR and
   HRV, with lowest HRV levels during slow wave sleep, high levels during
   REM sleep and intrasleep awakenings, and abrupt increases in HR at each
   transition from deeper sleep to lighter sleep or awakenings. The
   circadian influence was smaller, except for SDNN, which displayed a
   nocturnal increase of 140% whether the subjects slept or not, This study
   demonstrates that 24-h variations in HR and HRV are little influenced by
   the circadian clock and are mainly sleep-stage dependent. The results
   suggest an important role for exogenous factors in the morning increase
   in cardiovascular events. During sleep, the sudden rises in HR at each
   transition from deeper sleep to lighter sleep or awakenings might
   precipitate the adverse cardiac events.

AB Bergmann's rule is a widely-accepted biogeographic rule stating that
   individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments. While
   there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews
   documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used
   yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the
   strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between
   temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For
   eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10% of
   variation in mass, and for 79% of species the correlation was not
   statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is
   not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic
   variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require
   integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant
   temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that
   global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.

   salinity tolerance of Limia melanonotata, a poeciliid fish that occurs
   in west-central inland waters of Hispaniola. Routine metabolic rate and
   CTMax were measured in fish acclimated to three salinities (0, 30, and
   60 ppt) and temperatures (25degrees, 30degrees, and 35degreesC) for nine
   temperature-salinity combinations. Salinity and temperature did not
   significantly interact in their effect on RMR. For combined salinity
   acclimations, adjusted RMR (ANCOVA) was significantly lower at
   25degreesC than either 30degrees or 35degreesC. For combined temperature
   acclimations, mean RMR was significantly lower at 60 ppt than either 0
   or 30 ppt. Salinity and temperature had a significant interactive effect
   on temperature tolerance. Mean CTMax was significantly higher at
   30degrees than 25degreesC at all salinities, but at 35degreesC was
   significantly higher than at 25degrees or 30degreesC only among fish
   acclimated in fresh water. Fish exposed to a chronic increase in
   salinity experienced most mortality in a salinity range of 70-107 ppt,
   with females exhibiting greater salinity tolerance than males. Limia
   melanonotata approaches the upper extreme in salinity and temperature
   tolerances known for poeciliids. Our results also suggest that L.
   melanonotata may reduce energy expenditures at environmental extremes to
   tolerate harsh conditions for extended periods. Despite its eurythermal
   and euryhaline adaptations, L. melanonotata has a relatively restricted
   inland range in Hispaniola and is unknown from inshore brackish or
   marine habitats. The present distribution of this species and congeners
   may be the result of a combination of factors that include historical
   zoogeography and ecological requirements.

   techniques of the proxy rainfall record of northeastern South Africa
   based on annual carbon isotope (delta C-13) data obtained from baobab
   trees for the period 1600 AD - 2000 AD show clear evidence of the

   were identified above the 95% confidence level include the similar to
   11-year Schwabe cycle, the similar to 22-year Hale cycle as well as the
   80-110-year Gleissberg cycle. A Morlet wavelet analysis of the delta
   C-13 data between 1600 AD and 1700 AD shows the effect of the Maunder

   Significance:
   A spectral analysis of delta C-13 baobab tree ring data for southern
   Africa between 1600 AD and 2000 AD is presented. The results show - for
   the first time - that the delta C-13 time series contains the 11-year

   periodicities. In addition, the influence of the Maunder sunspot minimum
   between similar to 1650 AD and 1715 AD could also be clearly identified
   in the delta C-13 data for the first time. These findings are of
   significant importance to investigations of solar influences on climate

AB Atomic resolution and coarse-grained simulations of
   dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers were analyzed for
   fluctuations perpendicular to the bilayer using a completely
   Fourier-based method. We find that the fluctuation spectrum of motions
   perpendicular to the bilayer can be decomposed into just two parts: 1),
   a pure undulation spectrum proportional to q(-4) that dominates in the
   small-q regime; and 2), a molecular density structure factor
   contribution that dominates in the large-q regime. There is no need for
   a term proportional to q(-2) that has been postulated for protrusion
   fluctuations and that appeared to have been necessary to fit the
   spectrum for intermediate q. We suggest that earlier reports of such a
   term were due to the artifact of binning and smoothing in real space
   before obtaining the Fourier spectrum. The observability of an
   intermediate protrusion regime from the fluctuation spectrum is
   discussed based on measured and calculated material constants.

AB We investigated the heat tolerance of adults of three replicated lines
   of Drosophila melanogaster that have been evolving independently by
   laboratory natural selection for 15 yr at ''nonextreme'' temperatures
   (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, or 28 degrees C). These lines are known to
   have diverged in body size and in the thermal dependence of several
   life-history traits. Here we show that they differ also in tolerance of
   extreme high temperature as well as in induced thermotolerance (''heat
   hardening''). For example, the 28 degrees C flies bad the highest
   probability of surviving a heat shock, whereas the 18 degrees C flies
   generally had the lowest probability. A short heat pretreatment
   increased the heat tolerance of the 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C lines,
   and the threshold temperature necessary to induce thermotolerance was
   lower for the 18 degrees C line than for the 25 degrees C line. However,
   neither heat pretreatment nor acclimation to different temperatures
   influenced heat tolerance of the 28 degrees C line, suggesting the loss
   of capacity for induced thermotolerance and for acclimation. Thus,
   patterns of tolerance of extreme heat, of acclimation, and of induced
   thermotolerance have evolved as correlated responses to natural
   selection at nonextreme temperatures. A genetic analysis of heat
   tolerance of a representative replicate population each from the 18
   degrees C and 28 degrees C lines indicates that chromosomes 1, 2, and 3
   have significant effects on heat tolerance. However, the cytoplasm has
   little influence, contrary to findings in an earlier study of other
   stocks that had been evolving for 7 yr at 14 degrees C versus 25 degrees
   C. Because genes for heat stress proteins (hsps) are concentrated on
   chromosome 3, the potential role of hsps in the heat tolerance and of
   induced thermotolerance in these naturally selected lines is currently
   unclear. In any case, species of Drosophila possess considerable genetic
   variation in thermal sensitivity and thus have the potential to evolve
   rapidly in response to climate change; but predicting that response may
   be difficult.

   10 drilling sites, from 0 degrees to 52 degrees S, have been explored
   for paleoclimate reconstructions. Most of the ice cores reaching the
   bedrock cover the last 20,000 years with seasonal resolution over the
   last few centuries to the last 1000 years for the Quelccaya site. We
   discuss both the potential and the limitations of tropical ice cores as
   climate archives with regard to the collaborative effort to reconstruct
   past climate variations in South America over the last 1000 years. We
   point out the uniqueness of South American ice cores, due to their
   location at high altitude, and also their two main limitations, which
   are related to (i) the interpretation of certain proxies in terms of
   climate and (ii) the relatively poordating when seasonal cycles are no
   longer resolved. In addition, we present an overview of the proxies that
   have been used so far to analyze tropical climate dynamics. Finally we
   discuss records of ENSO, the Little Ice Age and the 20th century decadal
   variability including the anthropogenic period, which are all preserved
   in ice cores. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB China is a rapidly developing country with the largest share of the
   world's population. The extent of human activity, combined with diverse
   climates and landscapes, may allow for greater risk of biological
   invasions. To date, at least 529 invasive species have been identified,
   including 270 species of higher plants, 198 species of animals and 61
   species of microbes, resulting in an estimated annual economic loss of
   US$ 18.9 billion. Evidence to date suggests that different components of
   climate change (i.e. temperature, altered precipitation, extreme weather
   events and rising CO2 concentration) have already influenced the biology
   of invasive species in China. The influence of climate change may
   increase the negative economic or environmental consequences of some
   invasives; however, others may become disadvantaged. Although we are
   still at the earliest stages of understanding the consequences of
   climate change on invasive species biology, China is one of the
   countries that may be affected most dramatically by invasive species.
   Overall, understanding the interactions between climate change and
   invasive species biology is an important scientific challenge, but one
   in which Chinese scientists can make significant contributions. The
   inclusion of the invasive species issue in some of China's ongoing
   projects on global change could begin to address critical research needs
   in this area.

AB Investigations of the responses to acclimation of upper and lower lethal
   limits and limits to activity in insects have focused primarily on
   Drosophila. In the present study, Halmaeusa atriceps (Staphylinidae) is
   examined for thermal tolerance responses to acclimation, and seasonal
   acclimatization. In summer and winter, lower lethal temperatures of
   adults and larvae are approximately -7.6 +/- 0.03 and -11.1 +/- 0.06
   degrees C, respectively. Supercooling points (SCPs) are more variable,
   with winter SCPs of -5.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C in larvae and -6.3 +/- 0.8
   degrees C in adults. The species appears to be chill susceptible in
   summer and moderately freeze tolerant in winter, thus showing seasonal
   acclimatization. Similar changes cannot be induced solely by acclimation
   to low temperatures in the laboratory. Upper lethal temperatures show a
   weaker response to acclimation. There are also significant responses to
   acclimation of critical thermal limits. Critical thermal minima vary
   between -3.6 +/- 0.2 and -0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C in larvae, and from -4.1
   +/- 0.1 to -0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C in adults. By contrast, critical
   thermal maxima vary much less within adults and larvae. These findings
   are in keeping with the general pattern found in insects, although this
   species differs in several respects from others found on Marion Island.

AB Temperature has a profound effect on the species composition and
   physiology of marine phytoplankton, a polyphyletic group of microbes
   responsible for half of global primary production. Here, we ask whether
   and how thermal reaction norms in a key calcifying species, the
   coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, change as a result of 2.5 years of
   experimental evolution to a temperature approximate to 2 degrees C below
   its upper thermal limit. Replicate experimental populations derived from
   a single genotype isolated from Norwegian coastal waters were grown at
   two temperatures for 2.5 years before assessing thermal responses at 6
   temperatures ranging from 15 to 26 degrees C, with pCO(2) (400/1100/2200
   mu atm) as a fully factorial additional factor. The two selection
   temperatures (15 degrees/26.3 degrees C) led to a marked divergence of
   thermal reaction norms. Optimal growth temperatures were 0.7 degrees C
   higher in experimental populations selected at 26.3 degrees C than those
   selected at 15.0 degrees C. An additional negative effect of high pCO(2)
   on maximal growth rate (8% decrease relative to lowest level) was
   observed. Finally, the maximum persistence temperature (T-max) differed
   by 1-3 degrees C between experimental treatments, as a result of an
   interaction between pCO(2) and the temperature selection. Taken
   together, we demonstrate that several attributes of thermal reaction
   norms in phytoplankton may change faster than the predicted progression
   of ocean warming.

AB Reaction norms across seven constant and one fluctuating temperature of
   development were measured for thorax length and several wing size traits
   for up to 10 isofemale lines of each of the cactophilic Drosophila
   species, D. aldrichi and D. buzzatii, originating from the same
   locality. Maximum thorax length was reached at different low to
   intermediate temperatures for the two species, whereas wing length was
   highest at the lowest temperature in both species. Various ratio
   parameters showed pronounced species differences. The reaction norm for
   the wing loading index (wing length/thorax length) decreased
   monotonically with temperature in both species, but was much steeper and
   spanned a wider range in D. aldrichi than in D. buzzatii, suggesting
   either that wing loading is not a good characterization of night
   capacity or, more likely, that night optimization does not occur in the
   same manner in both species. The vein ratio (distal length/proximal
   length of the third vein) increased with temperature in D. buzzatii but
   decreased in D. aldrichi. Wing development in the two species thus is
   very different, with the proximal part of the wing in D. buzzatii more
   closely allied to the thorax than td the distal part. Among line
   variation was significant for all traits in both species, and most
   pronounced for thorax length and the ratio parameters. Coefficients of
   variation were significantly different between the species for all
   traits, with those in D. aldrichi higher than in D. buzzatii. Genetic
   variance in plasticity was significant for all traits in D. buzzatii,
   but only for seven out of 12 in D. aldrichi. Additive genetic variances
   for all traits in both species were significantly larger than zero.
   Genetic correlations between thorax length and several wing length
   parameters, and between these and wing area, were positive and generally
   significant in both species. The genetic correlation between the distal
   and the proximal length of the third vein was not significantly
   different from zero in D. aldrichi, but negative and significant in D.
   buzzatii. Heritabilites varied significantly among temperatures for
   almost all traits in both species. Phenotypic variances were generally
   higher in D. aldrichi than in D. buzzatii, and commonly highest at the
   extreme temperatures in the former species. At the high temperature the
   genetic variances also were usually highest in D. aldrichi. The data
   clearly suggest that the process of thermal adaptation is species
   specific and caution against generalizations based on the study of
   single species.

AB The alpine treeline is commonly regarded as being sensitive to climatic
   warming because regeneration and growth of trees at treeline generally
   are limited by low temperature. The alpine treelines of the Tibetan
   Plateau (TP) occur at the highest elevations (4,900 m above sea level)
   in the Northern Hemisphere. Ongoing climatic warming is expected to
   shift treelines upward. Studies of treeline dynamics at regional and
   local scales, however, have yielded conflicting results, indicating
   either unchanging treeline elevations or upward shifts. To reconcile
   this conflict, we reconstructed in detail a century of treeline
   structure and tree recruitment at sites along a climatic gradient of 4
   degrees C and mean annual rainfall of 650 mm on the eastern TP. Species
   interactions interacted with effects of warming on treeline and could
   outweigh them. Densification of shrubs just above treeline inhibited
   tree establishment, and slowed upward movement of treelines on a time
   scale of decades. Interspecific interactions are major processes
   controlling treeline dynamics that may account for the absence of an
   upward shift at some TP treelines despite continued climatic warming.

   the eclosion rhythm and phase shifts of oviposition rhythm of the high
   altitude (HA) strain of Drosophila ananassae originating from Badrinath
   (5123 m above sea level) in the Himalayas was compared with the low
   altitude (LA) strain from Firozpur (179 m above sea level). Reduced
   photic sensitivity of the HA strain is regarded as the result of natural
   selection, which led to the weakening of the coupling mechanism between
   the circadian pacemaker and light at the high altitude of origin. The
   present study was designed to determine whether or not the photic
   entrainment of the oviposition rhythm of the HA strain of D. ananassae
   is also altered by the high altitude of its origin, and the results are
   compared with those of the LA strain. The effects of light intensity on
   the phase angle difference (psi), degree of rhythmicity (R), the percent
   oviposition in photophase, the threshold light intensity (i.e., the
   intensity at which stable entrainment occurred), and the saturation
   light intensity (i.e., the intensity beyond which the values of 41 or
   amplitude of rhythm remained unaltered) were determined. Entrainment was
   studied in light-dark cycles in which the light intensity of 12 h of
   photophase varied from 1 to 1000 lux, and complete darkness prevailed in
   all scotophases. The oviposition rhythm of the HA strain was arrhythmic
   from 1 to 90 lux, weakly rhythmic at 95 lux, but rhythmic at or above
   100 lux, while that of the LA strain was weakly rhythmic at I lux but
   rhythmic at or above 2 lux. Oviposition of the HA strain occurred mostly
   in the photophase, while that of the LA strain occurred in the
   scotophase; as a result, the oviposition medians of the HA strain were
   around the subjective forenoons while those of the LA strain were around
   the subjective evenings. The percent of oviposition in photophase
   increased from 68 to 98 in the HA strain and from 5 to 33 in the LA
   strain as light intensity increased from 1 to 1000 lux. In the HA
   strain, the psi values were significantly less and values of R and
   percent oviposition in photophase were significantly more than those of
   the 1A strain at each level of light intensity. Threshold and saturation
   intensities for psi were 100 and 700 lux, respectively, for the HA
   strain, but just 2 and 45 lux, respectively, for the LA strain. The
   saturation intensity for R was 650 and 700 lux for the HA and LA
   strains, respectively. These results extend the confirmation that the

AB A major objective for geneticists is to decipher genetic architecture of
   traits associated with agronomic importance. However, a majority of such
   traits are complex, and their genetic dissection has been traditionally
   hampered not only by the number of minor-effect quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) but also by genome-wide interacting loci with little or no
   individual effect. Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) seed isoflavonoids
   display a broad range of variation, even in genetically stabilized lines
   that grow in a fixed environment, because their synthesis and
   accumulation are affected by many biotic and abiotic factors. Due to
   this complexity, isoflavone QTL mapping has often produced conflicting
   results especially with variable growing conditions. Herein, we
   comparatively mapped soybean seed isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and
   glycitein by using several of the most commonly used mapping approaches:
   interval mapping, composite interval mapping, multiple interval mapping
   and a mixed-model based composite interval mapping. In total, 26 QTLs,
   including many novel regions, were found bearing additive main effects
   in a population of RILs derived from the cross between Essex and PI
   437654. Our comparative approach demonstrates that statistical mapping
   methodologies are crucial for QTL discovery in complex traits. Despite a
   previous understanding of the influence of additive QTL on isoflavone
   production, the role of epistasis is not well established. Results
   indicate that epistasis, although largely dependent on the environment,
   is a very important genetic component underlying seed isoflavone
   content, and suggest epistasis as a key factor causing the observed
   phenotypic variability of these traits in diverse environments.

   abundance. The two-way dispersion analysis showed a significant
   influence of the ice period duration and the solar activity expressed in
   Wolf's numbers on the Japanese scallop abundance dynamics. The uneven
   years in the period from 1977 to 1984 were usually productive for M.
   yessoensis and S. swifti spat. After 1985, the even years became more
   productive (there was asynchronicity in the abundance dynamics compared
   with 1977-1984). Such asynchronicity appeared with the advent of the new
   22-year solar cycle, which caused a change in the magnet polarity in
   1986.

AB Climate-driven environmental change is predicted to accelerate over the
   coming decades. Anticipating the ecological consequences requires a
   fundamental understanding of how environmental variables influence key
   habitats and species. Southeastern Australia is a marine climate change
   hotspot, characterised by rapidly increasing sea surface temperatures,
   strengthening currents and increasing storm frequency. To understand
   ecosystem responses to environmental drivers in this region, and to
   anticipate future climate-driven change, we examined the spatial
   distribution and environmental relationships of key marine habitats,
   fish assemblages, and the ecologically important urchin Centrostephanus
   rodgersii along similar to 1000 km of reef off southeastern Australia
   using towed video transects. We also identified potential biological
   indicators of climate-driven changes to rocky reef ecosystems, based on
   ecological importance, ease of measurement, and sensitivity to one or
   more climate-affected environmental drivers. Significant latitudinal
   gradients were identified for biota, with habitats, fish assemblages and
   urchin densities all varying latitudinally with sea surface temperature
   and current strength. Wave energy and distance offshore were identified
   as drivers of biota at local-scales (1001000 m). These results indicate
   that climate-driven changes to various environmental factors will alter
   the composition and distribution of marine biota, at a variety of
   scales. The average thermal niche for fish assemblages varied
   significantly with changing mean sea surface temperature and may be a
   sentinel indicator of climate-driven changes. Coverage of the kelp
   Ecklonia radiata, densities of the urchin C. rodgersii, and coral cover
   were also confirmed as potential valuable biological indicators of
   climate-driven changes. These indicators, and the widespread baseline

AB Low temperature stress is common for rice grown in temperate regions and
   at high elevations in the tropics. The most senstive stage to this
   stress is booting, about 11 days before heading. Japonica cultivars are
   known to be more tolerant than indicas. We constructed a genetic map
   using 191 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a
   temperate japonica, M-202, and a tropical indica, IR50, in order to
   locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring cold tolerance. The map
   with a total length of 1,276.8 cM and an average density of one marker
   every 7.1 cM was developed from 181 loci produced by 175 microsatellite
   markers. Cold tolerance was measured as the degree of spikelet sterility
   of treated plants at a 12 degreesC temperature for 5 days in the growth
   chamber. QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 were identified
   to confer cold tolerance at the booting stage. The QTL contribution to
   the phenotypic variation ranged from 11 to 17%. The two QTLs with the
   highest contribution to variation, designated qCTB2a and qCTB3, were
   derived from the tolerant parent, M-202, each explaining approximately
   17% of the phenotypic variance. Two of the eight QTLs for cold tolerance
   were contributed by IR50.

AB Invasive species threaten biological diversity throughout the world.
   Understanding the dynamics of their spread is critical to mitigating
   this threat. In Australia, efforts are underway to control the invasive
   cane toad (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus). Range models based on their native
   bioclimatic envelope suggest that the cane toad is nearing the end of
   its invasion phase. However, such models assume a conserved niche
   between native and invaded regions and the absence of evolution to novel
   habitats. Here, we develop a dynamically updated statistical model to
   predict the growing extent of cane toad range based on their current
   distribution in Australia. Results demonstrate that Australian cane
   toads may already have the ability to spread across an area that almost
   doubles their current range and that triples projections based on their
   native distribution. Most of the expansion in suitable habitat area has
   occurred in the last decade and in regions characterized by high
   temperatures. Increasing use of extreme habitats may indicate that novel
   ecological conditions have facilitated a broader realized niche or that
   toad populations at the invasion front have evolved greater tolerance to
   extreme abiotic conditions. Rapid evolution to novel habitats combined
   with ecological release from native enemies may explain why some species
   become highly successful global invaders. Predicting species ranges
   following invasion or climate change may often require dynamically
   updated range models that incorporate a broader realization of niches in
   the absence of natural enemies and evolution in response to novel
   habitats.

AB Recent expansion of anoxia has become a global issue and there is
   potential for worsening under global warming. At the same time,
   obtaining proper long-term instrumental oxygen records is difficult,
   thus reducing the possibility of recording long-term changes in oxygen
   shifts that can be related with climate or human influence. Varved lake
   sediments provide the better time frame to study this phenomenon at high
   resolution. We tracked the oxic/anoxic shifts of the varved Lake
   Montcortes since 1500 CE, and tried to recognise anthropogenic and
   climatic influences combining biological and geochemical proxies.
   Four main scenarios emerged: 1) years with abrupt sediment inputs (A);
   2) years with outstanding mixing and oxygenation of the water column
   (B); 3) years with strong stratification, anoxia, intense sulfur
   bacterial activity and increased biomass production (C); 4) years with
   stratification and anoxia, but relatively less biomass production (D).
   In line with current limnologic trends, high supra-annual variability in
   the occurrence of oxygenation events was observed. Interestingly, at
   least 45.3% of the years were mixing years and, like the meromictic
   ones, were mostly clustered into groups of consecutive years, thus
   alternating years of monomixis with years of meromixis. Most years of D
   belong to the period 1500-1820 CE, when human activities were the most
   intense. Most years of A belonged to the climatic unstable period of
   1850-1899 CE. Years of B were irregularly distributed but were best
   represented in the period 1820-1849 CE. Most years of C belonged to the
   20th century. More than 90% of the years with climatic instrumental
   records belonged to B and C. Current climate warming seems to be taking
   control over the oxygenation capacity of the lake, especially since the
   second half of the 20th century. Our results support recent findings
   related to hypoxia spreading at the global scale. (C) 2017 Published by

AB Models of climate change predict that its effects on animal populations
   will not always be negative, but most studies indicate negative
   associations between changes in climate and the phenology of animal
   migration and reproduction. For some populations, however, climate
   change may render particular environments more favourable, with positive
   effects on population growth. We used a 30-year population dataset on
   over 2000 Common Eiders Somateria mollissima at a colony in southwest
   Iceland to examine the response of this species to climate fluctuations.
   Eiders are strongly dependent on suitable climatic conditions for
   successful reproduction and survival. Temperatures in southwest Iceland,
   in both winter and summer, have generally increased over the past 30
   years but have shown considerable fluctuation. We show that females laid
   earlier following mild winters and that year-to-year variation in the
   number of nests was related to the temperature during the breeding
   season 2 years previously. Milder summers could have positive effects on
   breeding success and offspring survival, producing an increase in nest
   numbers 2 years later when most Eiders recruit into the breeding
   population. In this part of their range, Eiders could benefit from a
   general warming of the climate.

AB Lolium perenne (cv. AberDart) was grown at 14 locations along a
   latitudinal gradient across Europe (3768 degrees N) to study the impact
   of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and climate on aboveground growth and
   foliar UV-B absorbing compounds. At each location, plants were grown
   outdoors for 5 weeks in a replicated UV-B filtration experiment
   consisting of open, UV-B transparent (cellulose diacetate) and UV-B
   opaque (polyester) environments. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy
   was used to compare plant metabolite profiles in relation to treatment
   and location. UV radiation and climatic parameters were determined for
   each location from online sources and the data were assessed using a
   combination of anova and multiple regression analyses. Most of the
   variation in growth between the locations was attributable to the
   combination of climatic parameters, with minimum temperature identified
   as an important growth constraint. However, no single environmental
   parameter could consistently account for the variability in plant
   growth. Concentrations of foliar UV-B absorbing compounds showed a
   positive trend with solar UV across the latitudinal gradient; however,
   this relationship was not consistent in all treatments. The most
   striking experimental outcome from this study was the effect of presence
   or absence of filtration frames on UV-absorbing compounds. Overall, the
   study demonstrates the value of an European approach in studying the
   impacts of natural UV across a large latitudinal gradient. We have shown
   the feasibility of coordinated UV filtration at multiple sites but have
   also highlighted the need for open controls and careful interpretation
   of plant responses.

AB In contrast to numerous studies showing breeding seasonality for animals
   living in temperate zones, few have addressed the effect of annual
   environmental changes on hormones and behavior related to reproduction
   for animals living in tropical and equatorial regions. In order to
   expand information on other primates living near the equator, we used 13
   adult common marmosets, eight males and five females living under
   natural climatic conditions in a colony located in North-Eastern Brazil.
   Blood samples were collected monthly from July 2002 to June 2004.
   Cortisol assays were performed by ELISA. Cortisol levels varied
   according to environmental temperature and rainfall but were not
   significantly affected by photoperiod. After separating out these
   environmental effects through an analysis of covariance for repeated
   measurements, a marginal significant difference in cortisol levels
   according to the seasons of the year was detected. A significant
   difference in cortisol levels between females and males was also
   observed. The results suggest that annual variation in cortisol in
   common marmosets is influenced by temperature and rainfall and might be
   associated with the mating season.

AB We estimated respiratory fluxes in a treeline-associated Pinus
   canariensis forest in Tenerife, Canary Islands, an ecotone with strong
   seasonal changes in soil water availability. CO2 efflux rates from the
   foliage, above ground woody tissue and the soil were measured by chamber
   techniques. Site-specific models obtained from these chamber
   measurements were then combined with half-hourly measurements of canopy,
   stem and soil temperature as well as with soil water potential, leaf
   area and stem sapwood volume data for scaling up component-specific CO2
   efflux to ecosystem respiration (R (ECO)). Integrated over an entire
   year R (ECO) was 550 g C m(-2) ground surface area (average of 2008 and
   2009) and comprised the following component fluxes: 57 % from the soil,
   10 % from above ground woody tissue and 33 % from the foliage. Between
   year differences in R (ECO) and its components were < 3 %. R (ECO)
   varied markedly throughout an entire year generally following the
   seasonal trends in temperature during most of the year. During the dry
   summer, however, R (ECO) was significantly reduced due to limited soil
   water availability in the rooting horizon. Thus, in treeline-associated
   forests under predicted scenarios of increasing aridity in Mediterranean
   regions, it is likely that there will be a shift in the contribution of
   CO2 efflux from the soil (R (S)), the foliage (R (F)) and above ground
   woody tissue (R (W)) to R (ECO) from predominately below ground to
   increasingly above ground. Such changes should be taken into account for
   predicting the response of treeline forests to a changing climate at
   their upper distribution limit.

AB Anolis sagrei, a Cuba and Bahama native lizard, is a successful invader
   in Florida and adjacent areas. Herein, we focus on conservatism in its
   climate niche axes and possible congruencies with its natural history
   properties. The not mutually exclusive hypotheses of the present study
   explaining its northern range limit are: (1) climatic conditions within
   species' native and invasive ranges are identical; (2) the species is
   pre-adapted to novel conditions as a result of historical climate
   variations; and (3) only some niche axes limit the species' invasive
   distribution and the observed pattern is explained by an interplay
   between the potential niche within its native range and life-history.
   Species distribution models for native and invasive distributions were
   built on ten bioclimatic variables. Using Schoener's niche overlap
   index, the degree of niche conservatism among variables was identified.
   Significances of hypothesis (1) were tested using null-model approaches.
   Possible climatic pre-adaptations were evaluated by comparing its actual
   tolerance within its invasive range with that of the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM) within its native range (hypothesis 2). Results of (1) and
   (2) are discussed in relation to natural history, approaching hypothesis
   3. We detect varying overlaps in niche axes, indicating that natural
   history properties are associated with conservative niche axes. Climatic
   comparisons with LGM of native and current conditions of invasive range
   suggest that pre-adaptations are unlikely. Possible shifts in the
   fundamental niche of the species may have been facilitated by enhanced
   genetic diversity in northern invasive populations. (C) 2011 The Linnean

AB Annual census data spanning seventy-five years document mortality and
   regeneration in a population of saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) in
   the Cactus Forest of the Rincon Mountain District of Saguaro National
   Park near Tucson, AZ. On 6 four-hectare plots, each saguaro was censused
   and a methodical search for new saguaros was conducted annually each
   year from 1942 through 2016, with the exception of 1955. Regeneration
   has been episodic with 828 plants established from 1959 through 1993
   compared with 34 plants established between 1942 and 1958 and only three
   plants established after 1993. The years preceding 1959 and following
   1993, include some of the driest decades in centuries in southern
   Arizona. While woodcutting and cattle grazing are believed to be among
   the causes of decades of failed regeneration prior to 1958, neither of
   these factors contributed to the failed regeneration following 1993. The
   height structure of the population from 1942 to 2016 shifted
   dramatically from a population dominated by large saguaros (>5.4 m tall)
   in the first three decades of the study to a population dominated by
   small saguaros (<1.8 m tall) in the most recent two decades. Mortality
   is shown to be strongly age dependent. In the year following the 2011
   catastrophic freeze, 21 of 59 plants older than 80 years died compared
   with zero deaths in 270 plants between the ages of 29 and 80 years.
   Saguaros under 40 years old, growing under small shrubs or in the open,
   have a lower probability of survival than better protected saguaros.
   Long-term population monitoring is essential to understanding the
   complex impacts of human and environmental factors on the population
   dynamics of long-lived species.

   capacity of skeletal muscle in winter to compensate for thermodynamic
   effects on metabolism. However, whether this compensation facilitates
   locomotor performance at low temperature is unknown. Therefore, our aim
   was to determine if thermal acclimation of metabolic enzymes in muscle
   benefits locomotion. Eastern newts from southern Ohio were acclimated to
   cold (5 degrees C, 10:14 L:D) or warm (25 degrees C, 14:10 L:D)
   conditions for 12 weeks. Following acclimation, we measured the
   locomotor performance (burst speed and time until exhaustion) and the
   activities of metabolic enzymes in skeletal muscle at 5-30 degrees C.
   Creatine kinase (CK) activity in skeletal muscle was higher in cold
   compared to warm-acclimated newts, and cold-acclimated newts had a
   higher burst speed at low temperature compared to warm-acclimated newts.
   At low temperature, time until exhaustion was higher in cold compared to
   warm-acclimated newts, but the activities of citrate synthase (CS) and
   cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in muscle were lower in cold compared to
   warm-acclimated newts. Together, these results demonstrate that eastern
   newts compensate for the effects of low temperature on locomotor
   performance. Whereas thermal compensation of CK activity is correlated
   with burst locomotion at low temperature, aerobic enzymes in skeletal
   muscle (CS and CCO) are not linked to compensation of sustained
   locomotion. J. Exp. Zool. 323A: 52-59, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

AB To obtain insights into the coupling between community composition,
   diversity and community function, bacterioplankton assemblages from the
   Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea) were exposed to increasing
   environmental stress throughout 2 wk in continuous seawater cultures to
   construct communities differing in composition and diversity. The
   assemblages were exposed to (1) decreased temperature, (2) decreased
   temperature and phosphate addition or (3) decreased temperature,
   phosphate addition and lowered oxygen level. Bacterial and viral
   abundances as well as bacterial community composition stabilized during
   the second week of the experiment. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed dramatic
   reductions in bacterial diversity in all treatments and major
   compositional differences relative to the inoculum. Nevertheless, no
   differences in the ability to exploit dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   were found for the acquired communities relative to the inoculum,
   indicating that the bacterial communities were functionally redundant.
   We speculate that oscillations in exploitation of the DOC pool in situ
   are mainly governed by factors limiting the overall bacterial growth,
   rather than perturbations affecting only subsets of the microbial biota.

AB Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound
   implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems
   that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and
   individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much
   climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution
   and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has
   revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean
   will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean
   chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the
   performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which
   drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences
   for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few
   'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes.
   Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic
   variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate
   climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine
   systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the
   existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research
   include identifying key demographic transitions that influence
   population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts
   of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to
   evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will
   change and living systems will respond.

   (Macoma) balthica dynamics in 4 distant (>100 km) areas of the Dutch
   Wadden Sea are described and compared, including annual recruitment,
   total abundance, age composition (recruits/adults) and adult survival.
   The aim was to determine to what extent long-term changes in L. balthica
   population attributes were synchronous in populations throughout the
   Dutch Wadden Sea and to identify possible underlying causes. At all 4
   sites studied, changes in annual recruitment (n m(-2) of spat-sized
   animals in summer) was synchronous with long-term declining trends and
   peaks and lows occurring in the same years at all sites. Adult survival
   was high for the first 15 to 20 yr, but irregular after 1990 with low
   values for periods of varying length. In contrast to the strongly
   synchronized recruitment, the low-survival periods were not synchronous
   over the Wadden Sea. Adult density and total biomass varied in parallel
   over most sites and were low throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea (less than
   a quarter of the earlier long-term average) from 2005 onwards. The
   factors suggested to underlie these changes in abundance were (1)
   negative effects of climate warming on recruitment, which includes
   higher abundance of predators on young bottom stages, and (2) an unknown
   cause of enhanced adult mortality, possibly disease. Synchronization in
   recruitment, adult density and total biomass of L. balthica populations
   throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea indicates that they are part of a Wadden
   Sea-wide metapopulation.

AB Biogeographic partitioning systems provide an important framework under
   which ocean management practices can be designed and implemented.
   Sea Surface Temperature (SST) provides important insights into the
   features and processes governing biogeography and the natural boundaries
   that separate regions (fronts). In this paper, a new methodology is
   suggested to segment the ocean at a subset of an Eastern Boundary
   Current system (Western Iberian Peninsula).
   To this end, a dense time series of daily MODIS data (Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a concentration, 2003-2014) was
   analyzed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The resulting dissimilarity
   matrix was then clustered using UPGMA to generate a set of dynamic
   regions. To determine whether the boundaries separating regions
   coincided with areas of maximum frontal activity, a matching time series
   was produced for the study area.
   The methodology successfully delivered a set of nested regions,
   explained by known oceanographic features and separated by natural
   boundaries collocated with frontal activity maxima (ANOVA, p < 0.01).
   The frontal activity, which was also found to be spatially organized
   (Moran's I > 0.82 and z-score > 6.95, for a p < 0.01) was thus
   correlated with the dissimilarity patterns of SST. Together, they offer
   a new perspective into the biogeographic constraints influencing an
   important ecosystem.
   SST-based regions were more informative (k= 4) but both the
   Chlorophyll-a and the multivariate (SST and Chlorophyll-a) alternatives
   reproduced the coastal/oceanic dichotomy of established systems in a
   dynamic way. The method was also applied to yearly subsets, which
   generally matched the regions delineated with the full time series while
   depicting inter-annual variability.
   The DTW and the frontal activity maps contributed to the definition of a
   scalable and ecologically-meaningful system, which can be adopted for
   the monitoring of marine areas using different (annual to decadal) time
   scales and easily accessible datasets.

AB Seed dormancy determines the timing of seed germination and may be
   released by dry storage, also referred to as after-ripening. Studies on
   dormancy-release mechanisms are often hampered by the long
   after-ripening requirements of seeds. After-ripening is thought to be
   mainly caused by oxidative processes during seed dry storage. These
   processes are also the main cause of seed ageing. Increasing partial
   oxygen pressure through the elevated partial pressure of oxygen (EPPO)
   system has been shown to mimic and accelerate dry seed ageing. In this
   study, we investigated whether the EPPO system may also release primary
   seed dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana. EPPO mimics dry after-ripening at
   the genetic level, as quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis after EPPO
   treatment identified the DELAY OF GERMINATION loci DOG1, DOG2, and DOG6
   that were first described in a study using dry after-ripening to release
   seed dormancy. QTL analysis also showed that dormancy release by cold
   stratification (another common method to break seed dormancy) partly
   overlaps with release by after-ripening and EPPO treatment. We conclude
   that EPPO is an appropriate method to mimic and accelerate dormancy
   release and, as such, may have applications in both research and
   industry.

AB Temporal variation in the soil CO2 emission from the worlds largest

   were carried out from three different parts of the mangrove forest, i.e.
   (1) deep forest (with limited tidal influence), (2) rooted (with
   pneumatophores, medium tree density and tidally active), and (3)
   un-rooted region (tidal flat). Subsequently, the role of soil salinity,
   temperature and the enzyme activities (Urease, beta-D glucosidase and
   Dehydrogenase activity) in regulating the microbial mineralization
   processes were also studied to understand their contribution to the soil
   CO2 emission. Irrespective of the sampling locations, the highest and
   lowest CO2 efflux was recorded during month from October to January and
   from June to September, respectively. Among the three different regions,
   the highest and the lowest CO2 emission was recorded from the deep
   forest (8.34 +/- 1.04 mmol C m(-2) h(-1)) and un-rooted soil (0.81 +/-
   0.07 mmol C m(-2) h(-1)), respectively. Soil CO2 emission did not show
   any significant response to salinity. However, soil temperature and
   available enzyme activities showed significant control over soil CO2
   emission. The results indicated that the microbial community in this
   tidally active zone is well adapted within a large salinity range. Among
   the soil enzymes, ss-D glucosidase activity showed the highest
   contribution, in regulating the soil CO2 emissions, in all the studied
   locations.

AB Several hundred Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) were collected from
   selected spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast in March 2002. Four
   areas or regions that represent a wide range of environmental conditions
   were chosen for our breeding experiments: Porsangerfjord, Tystjord,
   Helgeland, and Oygarden. Cod were transported to Oygarden near Bergen,
   individually tagged, and kept in sea cages. In both 2003 and 2004, a
   total of 40 family groups (adult pairs) representing the four regions
   were monitored for their spawning performance in separate tanks. During
   the spawning period, the quantity and diameter of eggs were recorded.
   During 2003, the time of peak spawning differed among groups. It was
   evident that the broodstock from the Oygarden region spawned about one
   month earlier than the broodstock collected from the Helgeland region.
   This also occurred in 2004, two years after the cod were collected,
   suggesting that the difference has a genetic component. Differences in
   life history parameters between cod populations, such as spawning cycles
   as described here, could be adaptive and under genetic control. This
   must be taken into consideration when assessing precautionary means of
   overcoming the problem with escapees from future cod mariculture. (c)

AB Since the transition from terrestrial to marine environments poses
   strong osmoregulatory and energetic challenges, temporal and spatial
   fluctuations in oceanic salinity might influence salt and water balance
   (and hence, body condition) in marine tetrapods. We assessed the effects
   of salinity on three species of sea snakes studied by mark-recapture in
   coral-reef habitats in the Neo-Caledonian Lagoon. These three species
   include one fully aquatic hydrophiine (Emydocephalus annulatus), one
   primarily aquatic laticaudine (Laticauda laticaudata), and one
   frequently terrestrial laticaudine (Laticauda saintgironsi). We explored
   how oceanic salinity affected the snakes' body condition across various
   temporal and spatial scales relevant to each species' ecology, using
   linear mixed models and multimodel inference. Mean annual salinity
   exerted a consistent and negative effect on the body condition of all
   three snake species. The most terrestrial taxon (L. saintgironsi) was
   sensitive to salinity over a short temporal scale, corresponding to the
   duration of a typical marine foraging trip for this species. In
   contrast, links between oceanic salinity and body condition in the fully
   aquatic E. annulatus and the highly aquatic L. laticaudata were
   strongest at a long-term (annual) scale. The sophisticated
   salt-excreting systems of sea snakes allow them to exploit marine
   environments, but do not completely overcome the osmoregulatory
   challenges posed by oceanic conditions. Future studies could usefully
   explore such effects in other secondarily marine taxa such as seabirds,
   turtles, and marine mammals.

AB Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic cytoskeletal elements involved in
   numerous cellular processes. Although they are highly rigid polymers
   with a persistence length of 1-8 mm, they may exhibit a curved shape at
   a scale of few micrometers within cells, depending on their biological
   functions. However, how MT flexural rigidity in cells is regulated
   remains poorly understood. Here we ask whether MT-associated proteins
   (MAPs) could locally control the mechanical properties of MTs. We show
   that two major cross-linkers of the conserved MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 family
   drastically decrease MT rigidity. Their MT-binding domain mediates this
   effect. Remarkably, the softening effect of MAP65 observed on single MTs
   is maintained when MTs are cross-linked. By reconstituting physical
   collisions between growing MTs/MT bundles, we further show that the
   decrease in MT stiffness induced by MAP65 proteins is responsible for
   the sharp bending deformations observed in cells when they coalign at a
   steep angle to create bundles. Taken together, these data provide new
   insights into how MAP65, by modifying MT mechanical properties, may
   regulate the formation of complex MT arrays.

AB Bacterial carbon demand, an important component of ecosystem dynamics in
   polar waters and sea ice, is a function of both bacterial production
   (BP) and respiration (BR). BP has been found to be generally higher in
   sea ice than underlying waters, but rates of BR and bacterial growth
   efficiency (BGE) are poorly characterized in sea ice. Using melted ice
   core incubations, community respiration (CR), BP, and bacterial
   abundance (BA) were studied in sea ice and at the ice-water interface
   (IWI) in the Western Canadian Arctic during the spring and summer 2008.
   CR was converted to BR empirically. BP increased over the season and was
   on average 22 times higher in sea ice as compared with the IWI. Rates in
   ice samples were highly variable ranging from 0.2 to 18.3 mu g C l(-1)
   d(-1). BR was also higher in ice and on average similar to 10 times
   higher than BP but was less variable ranging from 2.39 to 22.5 mu g C
   l(-1) d(-1). Given the high variability in BP and the relatively more
   stable rates of BR, BP was the main driver of estimated BGE (r (2) =
   0.97, P < 0.0001). We conclude that microbial respiration can consume a
   significant proportion of primary production in sea ice and may play an
   important role in biogenic CO2 fluxes between the sea ice and
   atmosphere.

AB Many infectious diseases have seasonal trends and exhibit variable
   periods of peak seasonality. Understanding the population dynamics due
   to seasonal changes becomes very important for predicting and
   controlling disease transmission risks. In order to investigate the
   impact of time-dependent delays on disease control, we propose an SEIRS
   epidemic model with a periodic latent period. We introduce the basic
   reproduction ratio R-0 for this model and establish a threshold type
   result on its global dynamics in terms of R-0. More precisely, we show
   that the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive if R-0<
   1; while the system admits a positive periodic solution and the disease
   is uniformly persistent if R-0 > 1. Numerical simulations are also
   carried out to illustrate the analytic results. In addition, we find
   that the use of the temporal average of the periodic delay may
   underestimate or overestimate the real value of R-0.

AB 1. The mean durations of development in the pupae of Drosophila
   melanogaster (Meigen) and their survival were measured at combinations
   of six constant temperatures (15, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5 and 30 degrees C)
   and up to 11 levels of relative humidity. The thermal survival range for
   the pupae is between 15 and 30 degrees C, and the humidity viable range
   is between 60 and 100% RH.
   2. The percentage water loss of the pupae was measured at six constant
   temperatures and four levels of relative humidity; There was a rapid
   increase in the percentage of water lost during the first 24 h exposure
   at all tested conditions. However, pupae reared at 100% RH at each
   constant temperature, sustained the lowest water loss. The percentage
   water loss increased as temperature increased, as humidity decreased and
   also with time.
   3. The duration of larval development studied at six constant
   temperatures (15, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5 and 30 degrees C) was inversely
   related to temperature. A wide range of alternating temperature regimes
   had a small, though statistically significant, accelerative effect on
   larval developmental time. Thus, the present results may be used as a
   basis for modelling development under changing temperatures, with the
   assumption that the developmental rate is nearly identical to that from
   a series of constant temperatures. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by

AB Soil respiration (R (s)) is an important component of the carbon cycle
   in terrestrial ecosystems, and changes in soil respiration with land
   cover alteration can have important implications for regional carbon
   balances. In southeastern China (Xiashu Experimental Forest, Jiangsu
   Province), we used an automated LI-8100 soil CO2 flux system to quantify
   diurnal variation of soil respiration in a secondary oak forest and a
   pine plantation. We found that soil respiration in the pine plantation
   was significantly higher than that in the secondary oak forest. There
   were similar patterns of soil respiration throughout the day in both the
   secondary oak forest and the pine plantation during our 7-month study
   (March-September 2005). The maximum of R (s) occurred between 4:00 pm
   and 7:00 pm. The diurnal variations of R (s) were usually out of phase
   with soil surface (0.5 cm) temperature (T (g)). However, annual
   variation in R (s) correlated with surface soil temperature. Soil
   respiration reached to a maximum in June, and decreased thereafter. The
   Q(10) of R (s) in the secondary oak forest was significantly higher than
   that in the pine plantation. The higher Q(10) value in the secondary oak
   forest implied that it might release more CO2 than the pine plantation
   under a global-warming scenario. Our results indicated that land-use
   change from secondary forest to plantation may cause a significant
   increase in CO2 emission, and reduce the temperature sensitivity of soil
   respiration in southeastern China.

AB Regional coastal conditions have a strong influence on juvenile salmon
   survival during their critical first months in the marine environment.
   Salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) survival has been thought to be favored
   within the high latitude downwelling domain if water column stabilities
   increase, whereas stability may have the opposite effect in
   upwelling-dominated lower latitudes. In this study, the relationships
   between water column stabilities during early marine residence of pink
   salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in both the upwelling and downwelling
   domains of the northeast Pacific Ocean and marine survival rates for
   hatchery stocks ranging from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to
   Kodiak Island, Alaska, were explored. Contrary to expectation, there was
   no clear difference in the effect of stability on marine survival rates
   in the downwelling and upwelling domains. In both domains, marine
   survival rates increased for pink salmon stocks that experienced
   below-average stability on the inner shelf during early marine
   residence. Stability effects from the outer shelf showed no consistent
   relationship to marine survival within the northeast Pacific.

AB The influence of several meteorological parameters on acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI) incidences with immediately and/or delayed effects has
   been widely reported. It remains unknown whether the individual AMI
   subtypes reveal similar patterns. To date, generally seasonal variation
   in ST elevation MI (STEMI) has been investigated. However, these
   approaches couldn't detect the effects of changes in multiple
   meteorological variables on STEMI incidence within a specific season.
   Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore immediate, delayed and
   cumulative effects of average daily temperature, atmospheric pressure
   and humidity on nation-wide STEMI hospital admissions. We linked daily
   hospitals' STEMI admission data with meteorological stations' data
   according to the patient's permanent residence. Subsequently, a
   multivariate analysis based on a main effect generalised linear model,
   assuming a log-link function with a Poisson distribution, was conducted.
   With the help of lags, we were able to analyse delayed effects, while
   the cumulative effects of specific meteorological variables were
   analysed utilising time windows. As a result, we confirmed immediate and
   delayed negative effect of low temperature and low relative humidity for
   all observed lags as well as cumulative average effects of low
   temperature and low relative humidity for all observed time windows.
   However, no delayed, single-day effect for atmospheric pressure was
   detected. Nevertheless, the cumulative average effect was confirmed in
   all time windows suggesting that prolonged low pressure influences the
   incidence of STEMI. A novelty of our approach is the comparative
   examination of immediate, delayed and cumulative effect of specific
   meteorological variables on the incidence of STEMI. This approach
   enables us to gain a new insight into the phenomenon studied.

AB The Tagus pro-delta (Portuguese Margin) and the Skagerrak (NE of the
   North Sea) are two marine systems controlled by atmospheric changes,
   which at present are mainly determined by fluctuations of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). On the basis of diatom records from marine
   sediment cores, environmental changes (primary productivity and
   salinity) are reconstructed for the last 2000 years for both regions.
   These sites are investigated focusing on the regional response to
   changing NAO forcing.
   Both studied sites are characterized by sedimentation rates in the order
   of 0.12 cm/year and 0.47 cm/year for the most recent deposits off the
   Tagus pro-delta, allowing high-resolution palcocearrographic
   reconstructions (8.3 and 2.1 years represented per sample). The last
   2000 years are a period covering in Europe the historical climatic
   periods known as the Dark Ages (DA), the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and
   the Little Ice Age (LIA). In the Skagerrak, the cold periods of the DA
   and LIA are marked by diatom dissolution stages, whereas at the Tagus
   pro-delta, the DA were associated with increased diatom production and
   possible upwelling and the onset of the LIA corresponded to enhanced
   flow of the Tagus River. During the MWP, better diatom preservation in
   the Skagerrak, related to stronger advection of salty Atlantic waters,
   is paralleled by dominant upwelling conditions at the Tagus pro-delta.
   The two most intense upwelling periods at the Tagus pro-delta, at
   similar to AD 600 and similar to AD 900, correspond to a dissolution
   stage and a slight change in salinity in the Skagerrak, respectively.
   Although the comparison of the two study sites suggests a common forcing
   such as the NAO, the different inferred behaviors for each main climatic
   period in each region demonstrate that the NAO by its own is not
   sufficient to explain the climatic variability at a regional scale. (c)

AB Giant clams are found in a mutualistic association with Symbiodiniaceae
   dinoflagellates. While clams are economically important for fisheries,
   Symbiodiniaceae are responsible for most of the primary production in
   coral reefs. This review addresses key issues regarding the giant
   clam-Symbiodiniaceae holobiont: diversity and distribution; functional
   traits; evolution and coevolution; and consequences of climate change.
   Findings show that holobiont distribution is partitioned by host species
   and geography. So far, giant clams have been reported in association
   with only 30 Symbiodiniaceae phylotypes, all within genera Symbiodinium,
   Cladocopium and Durusdinium. Species and functional diversities are
   highest in the Coral Triangle. The association evolved in the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition; there is evidence for coevolution,
   including host organs developed for housing symbionts, change in host
   habitat and multiple symbiont phylotypes found exclusively in giant
   clams. Clam bleaching events have been recorded throughout the
   Indo-Pacific. These clams may be particularly vulnerable, as they rarely
   associate with stress-tolerant symbionts and are heavily targeted by
   fishing. The Great Barrier Reef is particularly at risk, as clams in
   that area do not associate with thermally tolerant,
   low-irradiance-adapted and opportunistic symbiont phylotypes. Further
   reduction in giant clam populations may serve as an important indicator
   of the increasing decline of coral reef biodiversity.

AB The simplest model for a neutrophil in its ''passive'' state views the
   cell as consisting of a liquid-like cytoplasmic region surrounded by a
   membrane. The cell surface is in a state of isotropic contraction, which
   causes the cell to assume a spherical shape. This contraction is
   characterized by the cortical tension. The cortical tension shows a weak
   area dilation dependence, and it determines the elastic properties of
   the cell for small curvature deformations. At high curvature
   deformations in small pipets (with internal radii less than 1 mu m), the
   measured critical suction pressure for cell flow into the pipet is
   larger than its estimate from the law of Laplace. A model is proposed
   where the region consisting of the cytoplasm membrane and the underlying
   cortex (having a finite thickness) is introduced at the cell surface.
   The mechanical properties of this region are characterized by the
   apparent cortical tension (defined as a free contraction energy per unit
   area) and the apparent bending modulus (introduced as a bending free
   energy per unit area) of its middle plane. The model predicts that for
   small curvature deformations (in pipets having radii larger than 1.2 mu
   m) the role of the cortical thickness and the resistance for bending of
   the membrane-cortex complex is negligible. For high curvature
   deformations, they lead to elevated suction pressures above the values
   predicted from the law of Laplace. The existence of elevated suction
   pressures for pipets with radii from 1 mu m down to 0.24 mu m is found
   experimentally. The measured excess suction pressures cannot be
   explained only by the modified law of Laplace (for a cortex with finite
   thickness and negligible bending resistance), because it predicts
   unacceptable high cortical thicknesses (from 0.3 to 0.7 mu m). It is
   concluded that the membrane-cortex complex has an apparent bending
   modulus from 1 x 10(-18) to 2 x 10(-18) J for a cortex with a thickness
   from 0.1 mu m down to values much smaller than the radius of the
   smallest pipet (0.24 mu m) used in this study.

AB Recent theory suggests that global warming may be catastrophic for
   tropical ectotherms. Although most studies addressing temperature
   effects in ectotherms utilize constant temperatures, Jensen's inequality
   and thermal stress considerations predict that this approach will
   underestimate warming effects on species experiencing daily temperature
   fluctuations in nature. Here, we tested this prediction in a neotropical
   pseudoscorpion. Nymphs were reared in control and high-temperature
   treatments under a constant daily temperature regime, and results
   compared to a companion fluctuating-temperature study. At constant
   temperature, pseudoscorpions outperformed their fluctuating-temperature
   counterparts. Individuals were larger, developed faster, and males
   produced more sperm, and females more embryos. The greatest impact of
   temperature regime involved short-term, adult exposure, with constant
   temperature mitigating high-temperature effects on reproductive traits.
   Our findings demonstrate the importance of realistic temperature regimes
   in climate warming studies, and suggest that exploitation of
   microhabitats that dampen temperature oscillations may be critical in
   avoiding extinction as tropical climates warm.

AB To forecast the responses of species to future climate change, an
   understanding of the ability of species to adapt to long-term shifts in
   temperature is crucial. We present a review on evolutionary adaptation
   and phenotypic plasticity of temperature-related traits in terrestrial
   invertebrates. The evidence for adaptive evolution in melanization is
   good, but we caution that genetic determination needs to be tested in
   each individual species, and complex genetic correlations may exist. For
   phenological traits allochronic data sets provide powerful means to
   track climate-induced changes; however, rarely are responses
   deconstructed into evolutionary and plastic responses. Laboratory
   studies suggest climate change responses in these traits will be driven
   by both. For stress resistance, the evidence for shifts in traits is
   poor. Studies leaning heavily on Drosophila have demonstrated potential
   limits to evolutionary responses in desiccation and heat resistance.
   Quantifying the capacity for these species to respond plastically and
   extending this work to other taxa will be an important next step. We
   also note that, although not strictly speaking a species trait, the
   response of endosymbionts to heat stress requires further study.
   Finally, while clearly genetic, and possibly adaptive, the anonymous
   nature of latitudinal shifts in clines of genetic markers in Drosophila
   prevents further interpretation.

AB We examined the effect of elevation on litter-size variation in

   Mexico. Female snout-vent length (SVL) decreased with increasing
   elevation, and absolute litter size based on embryos also tended to
   decrease with increasing elevation. However, after controlling for
   variation in female body size, we found that litter sizes tended to be
   relatively larger at higher elevation. Elevation therefore appears to
   influence litter size in these lizards; however relatively little of the
   variation is explained by elevation; thus, other factors are likely
   making substantial contributions to the observed litter-size variation.
   The S. grammicus complex appears to be a good model system for examining

AB Morphological and physiological considerations suggest that sprinting
   ability and endurance capacity put conflicting demands on the design of
   an animal's locomotor apparatus and therefore cannot he maximized
   simultaneously. To test this hypothesis, we correlated size-corrected
   maximal sprint speed and stamina of 12 species of lacertid lizards.
   Phylogenetically independent contrasts of sprint speed and stamina
   showed a significant negative relationship, giving support to the idea
   of an evolutionary trade-off between the two performance measures. To
   test the hypothesis that the trade-off is mediated by a conflict in
   morphological requirements, we correlated both performance traits with
   snout-vent length, size-corrected estimates of body mass and limb
   length, and relative hindlimb length (the residuals of the relationship
   between hind- and forelimb length). Fast-running species had hindlimbs
   that were long compared to their forelimbs. None of the other size or
   shape variables showed a significant relationship with speed or
   endurance. We conclude that the evolution of sprint capacity may be
   constrained by the need for endurance capacity and vice versa, but the
   design conflict underlying this trade-off has yet to he identified.

AB Latitudinal clines are considered a powerful means of investigating
   evolutionary responses to climatic selection in nature. However, most
   clinal studies of climatic adaptation in Drosophila have involved
   species that contain cosmopolitan inversion polymorphisms that show
   clinal patterns themselves, making it difficult to determine whether the
   traits or inversions are under selection. Further, although climatic
   selection is unlikely to act on only one life stage in metamorphic
   organisms, a few studies have examined clinal patterns across life
   stages. Finally, clinal patterns of heat tolerance may also depend on
   the assay used. To unravel these potentially confounding effects on
   clinal patterns of thermal tolerance, we examined adult and larval heat
   tolerance traits in populations of Drosophila simulans from eastern
   Australia using static and dynamic (ramping 0.06 similar to degrees C
   similar to min-1) assays. We also used microsatellites markers to
   clarify whether demographic factors or selection are responsible for
   population differentiation along clines. Significant cubic clinal
   patterns were observed for adult static basal, hardened and dynamic heat
   knockdown time and static basal heat survival in larvae. In contrast,
   static, hardened larval heat survival increased linearly with latitude
   whereas no clinal association was found for larval ramping survival.
   Significant associations between adult and larval traits and climatic
   variables, and low population differentiation at microsatellite loci,
   suggest a role for climatic selection, rather than demographic
   processes, in generating these clinal patterns. Our results suggest that
   adaptation to thermal stress may be species and life-stage specific,
   complicating our efforts to understand the evolutionary responses to
   selection for increasing thermotolerance.

AB Objective: Several experimental studies reported evidence of a negative
   energy balance at higher temperatures. However, corresponding weight
   loss has not been noted in clinical practice. This study investigated
   the geographical association between outdoor temperature and body weight
   in Japanese adolescents and children.
   Methods: An ecological analysis was conducted using prefecture-level
   data on the mean body weight of Japanese adolescents and children over a
   25-year period and Japanese mesh (regional) climatic data on the mean
   annual temperature, mean daily maximum temperature in August, and mean
   daily minimum temperature in January were also analyzed.
   Results: Correlation analysis uncovered a stronger association between
   weight and the mean daily maximum temperature in August than with other
   climatic variables. Moreover, multiple regression analysis indicated
   that height and the mean daily maximum temperature in August were
   statistically significant predictors of weight. This suggests that
   geographical differences in weight in Japanese adolescents and children
   can be explained by the complementary relationship between
   height-associated weight gain and weight loss caused by summer heat.
   Conclusions: Summer temperatures may reduce the proportion of children
   who are overweight and contribute to geographical differences in body
   weight in Japanese adolescents and children. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

AB To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts
   under climate change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate
   or rely on adaptation through plastic or evolutionary means. Studies
   suggest that some ectotherms have a limited potential to change their
   upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but research has mostly
   focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here we use
   replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested
   half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities
   and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both
   laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign,
   and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results
   demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic
   variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic
   variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures
   when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward
   lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed
   under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the
   field setting. Overall the results suggest that ectotherms that already
   experience temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limits
   have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures by
   evolutionary means.

AB The tropics are characterized by a variety of atmospheric and oceanic
   systems dominated by multiscale interaction processes. This is Part I of
   a two-part review study on climate and climate variability of the
   Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Here, the mean fields of incoming short
   wave radiation, surface energy fluxes, sea surface temperature, sea
   level pressure, salinity, wind patterns at 10m height, wind stress curl,
   precipitation, and evaporation are analyzed and synthetized using
   available data including that from the last decade. Given the strong
   interaction between the ETP and Caribbean Sea-Atlantic Ocean, mean field
   discussions are presented for two different domains, a relatively large
   domain from 24 degrees S - 36 degrees N and between 129 degrees W -17
   degrees W, and a smaller domain embedding only the Caribbean Sea and the
   easternmost part of the ETP. Most results on the climate of these two
   regions can be used as the base line for climate change studies.
   Interannual variability of tropical cyclones is also investigated over
   the domain of the latter two basins in the smaller domain. The study is
   complemented with a short review of some low frequency modes, such as,
   El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the
   Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation. Such low-frequency modes are known
   to modulate regional systems, including tropical cyclone frequency. Rev.

AB Komodo dragons from hatchlings ( approximate to 0.1 kg) to adults ( <=
   80 kg) express the full magnitude of varanid species size distributions.
   We found that all size groups of dragons regulated a similar preferred
   body temperature by exploiting a heterogeneous thermal environment
   within savanna, forest and mangrove habitats. All dragons studied,
   regardless of size, were able to regulate a daytime active body
   temperature within the range 34-35.6 degrees C for 5.1-5.6 h/day. The
   index of effectiveness of thermoregulation (a numerical rating of
   thermoregulatory activity) was not different among size groups of
   dragons. However, the index of closeness of thermoregulation, which
   rates the variability of body temperature, suggests a greater precision
   for regulating a preferred body temperature for medium compared to small
   and large dragons. Reference copper cylinders simulating small, medium
   and large Komodo dragons heated and cooled at the same rate, whereas
   actual dragons of all size groups heated faster than they cooled. Larger
   dragons heated and cooled more slowly than smaller ones. The mean
   operative environmental temperatures of copper cylinders representing
   medium sized dragons were 42.5, 32.0 and 29.4 degrees C for savannah,
   forest and mangrove habitats, respectively. The index for average
   thermal quality of a habitat as measured by the absolute difference
   between operative environmental temperature and the dragon's thermal
   range suggests the forest habitat offers the highest thermal quality to
   dragons and the savannah the lowest. The percent of total daytime that
   the operative environmental temperature was within the central 50% of
   the body temperatures selected by dragons in a thermal gradient
   (Phillips, 1984) was 45%, 15%, and 9% for forest, mangrove and savannah,
   respectively. Forest habitat offers the most suitable thermal
   environment and provides the greatest number of hours with conditions
   falling within the dragon's thermal activity zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Grape berry internal oxygen concentration is dependent upon lenticels on
   the pedicel, and cell death in the mesocarp is correlated to hypoxia
   during ripening.Mesocarp cell death (CD) during ripening is common in
   berries of seeded Vitis vinifera L. wine cultivars. We examined if
   hypoxia within berries is linked to CD. The internal oxygen
   concentration ([O-2]) across the mesocarp was measured in berries from
   Chardonnay and Shiraz, both seeded, and Ruby Seedless, using an oxygen
   micro-sensor. Steep [O-2] gradients were observed across the skin and
   [O-2] decreased toward the middle of the mesocarp. As ripening
   progressed, the minimum [O-2] approached zero in the seeded cultivars
   and correlated to the profile of CD across the mesocarp. Seed
   respiration declined during ripening, from a large proportion of total
   berry respiration early to negligible at later stages. [O-2] increased
   towards the central axis corresponding to the presence of air spaces
   visualized using X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT). These air spaces
   connect to the pedicel where lenticels are located that are critical for
   berry O-2 uptake as a function of temperature, and when blocked caused
   hypoxia in Chardonnay berries, ethanol accumulation, and CD. The
   implications of hypoxia in grape berries are discussed in terms of its
   role in CD, ripening, and berry water relations.

AB The phenotypic effects of genetic and environmental manipulations have
   been rarely investigated simultaneously. In addition to phenotypic
   plasticity, their effect on the amount and directions of genetic and
   phenotypic variation is of particular evolutionary importance because
   these constitute the material for natural selection. Here, we used
   heterozygous insertional mutations of 16 genes involved in the formation
   of the Drosophila wing. The flies were raised at two developmental
   temperatures (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Landmark-based geometric
   morphometrics was used to analyze the variation of the wing size and
   shape at different hierarchical levels: among genotypes and
   temperatures; among individuals within group; and fluctuating asymmetry
   (FA). Our results show that (1) the phenotypic effects of the mutations
   depend on temperature; (2) reciprocally, most mutations affect wing
   plasticity; (3) both temperature and mutations modify the levels of FA
   and of among individuals variation within lines. Remarkably, the
   patterns of shape FA seem unaffected by temperature whereas those
   associated with individual variation are systematically altered. By
   modifying the direction of available phenotypic variation, temperature
   might thus directly affect the potential for further evolution. It
   suggests as well that the developmental processes responsible for
   developmental stability and environmental canalization might be
   partially distinct.

AB Macroalgae drive the biodiversity and functioning of many shallow
   benthic ecosystems. Besides their key role in coastal ecosystems, they
   are rich sources of a wide variety of unique molecules with high impact
   in food science, pharmaceutical industry and public health. Carotenoids
   and chlorophylls present in three kelp species-Laminaria ochroleuca,
   Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides-were determined by
   high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array
   detector. The effect of different harvesting times, depths and growth
   conditions (wild vs. aquaculture) on pigment qualitative and
   quantitative profiles was assessed. Stipes, blades and whole macroalgae
   were studied. In spite of the considerable variability observed amongst
   all samples, fucoxanthin was evidently the main carotenoid. Overall, the
   relative contents of carotenoids were significantly higher than those of
   chlorophylls. In addition, the cultivation of macroalgae in an
   integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system appears to increase pigment
   levels. Altogether, the results demonstrate the complexity of the
   influence of species-specific and environmental factors on pigment
   composition and reinforce that macroalgae cultivation systems may
   provide an interesting approach to optimize the production of some
   valuable metabolites.

AB While the ecological effects of climate change have been widely
   observed, most efforts to document these impacts in terrestrial systems
   have concentrated on the impacts of temperature. We used tree swallow
   (Tachycineta bicolor) nest observations from two widely separated sites
   in central Alaska to examine the aspects of climate affecting breeding
   phenology at the northern extent of this species' range. We found that
   two measures of breeding phenology, annual lay and hatch dates, are more
   strongly predicted by windiness and precipitation than by temperature.
   At our longest-monitored site, breeding phenology has advanced at nearly
   twice the rate seen in more southern populations, and these changes
   correspond to long-term declines in windiness. Overall, adverse spring
   climate conditions known to negatively impact foraging success of
   swallows (wet, windy weather) appear to influence breeding phenology
   more than variation in temperature. Separate analyses show that short
   windy periods significantly delay initiation of individual clutches
   within years. While past reviews have emphasized that increasing
   variability in climate conditions may create physiological and
   ecological challenges for natural populations, we find that long-term
   reductions in inclement weather corresponded to earlier reproduction in
   one of our study populations. To better predict climate change impacts,
   ecologists need to more carefully test effects of multiple climate
   variables, including some, like windiness, that may be of paramount
   importance to some species, but have rarely been considered as strong
   drivers of ecological responses to climate alteration.

AB We tested whether snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) trees growing in

   response functions of leaf respiration (R) and fluorescence (Fo).
   Measurements were made on pot-grown saplings and field-grown trees
   (growing between 1380 and 2110m a.s.l.). Using a continuous,
   high-resolution protocol, we quantified T response curves of R and Fo -
   these data were used to identify an algorithm for modelling R-T curves
   at subcritical T's and establish variations in heat tolerance. For the
   latter, we quantified Tmax [T where R is maximal] and Tcrit [T where Fo
   rises rapidly]. Tmax ranged from 51 to 57 degrees C, varying with season
   (e.g. winter>summer). Tcrit ranged from 41 to 49 degrees C in summer and
   from 58 to 63 degrees C in winter. Thus, surprisingly, leaf energy
   metabolism was more heat-tolerant in trees experiencing ice-encasement
   in winter than warmer conditions in summer. A polynomial model fitted to
   log-transformed R data provided the best description of the
   T-sensitivity of R (between 10 and 45 degrees C); using these model
   fits, we found that the negative slope of the Q10-T relationship was
   greater in winter than in summer. Collectively, our results (1)
   highlight high-T limits of energy metabolism in E.pauciflora and (2)
   provide a framework for improving representation of T-responses of leaf
   R in predictive models.

AB A marker's dark triplet state is of great importance in fluorescence
   microscopy: It serves as a means to switch off fluorescent markers and
   is thus the enabling element for several super-resolution methods. On
   the other hand, intersystem-crossing to the electronic dark triplet
   state strongly reduces the fluorescence yield in conventional
   fluorescence microscopy. The ability to determine the kinetic parameters
   of transitions into the triplet state is thus of great importance and
   because fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be applied
   without disturbing the system under study, it is one of the preferred
   methods to do so. However, conventional FCS observations of triplet
   dynamics suffer from bias due to the spatially inhomogeneous irradiance
   profile of the excitation laser. Herein, we present a novel method to
   correct this bias and verify it by analyzing both Monte Carlo simulated
   and experimental data of the organic dye Rhodamine 110 in aqueous
   solution for both continuous-wave and pulsed excitation. Importantly,
   our approach can be readily generalized to most other FCS experiments
   that determine intensity dependent kinetic parameters. (C) 2014 Wiley

AB Temperature variation throughout a species range can be extensive and
   exert divergent spatiotemporal patterns of selection. The estimation of
   phenotypic differences of populations along environmental gradients
   provides information regarding population-level responses to changing
   environments and evolutionary lability in climate-relevant traits.
   However, few studies have found physiological differentiation across
   environmental gradients attributable to behavioural thermoregulation
   buffering physiological evolution. Here, we compared thermal sensitivity
   of physiological performance among three populations of the ornate tree
   lizard (Urosaurus ornatus) along a 1100 m elevational gradient in
   southeastern Arizona across years in order to determine whether spatial
   differences in thermal environments are capable of driving local
   physiological differentiation. Lizards exhibited significant
   population-level differences in thermal physiology. The thermal traits
   of lizards at low elevations included warmer body temperatures and
   higher preferred and critical thermal temperatures. In contrast, lizards
   at higher elevations had cooler body temperatures and lower preferred
   and critical thermal temperatures. Populations also exhibited
   differences in the optimal temperature for performance and thermal
   performance breadth. The direction of population variation was
   consistent across years. Environmental gradients can provide model
   systems for studying the evolution of thermal physiology, and our study
   is one of the first to suggest that population differentiation in
   thermal physiology could be more prominent than previously thought.

AB Aims
   Riparian ecosystems play an important role in overall ecosystem
   function, including the global carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems,
   at both landscape and global scales. Yet few studies have reported in
   situ measurements of CO2 in riparian areas where flooding is a unique
   disturbance to carbon cycling.
   Methods
   At multiple locations across riparian zones (RZ) with different water
   submergences in Xiangxi Bay (XXB), we studied seasonal variations of CO2
   exchange between this Cynodon-dominated community and the atmosphere for
   2 years by using static chambers.
   Important Findings
   We found that the seasonal changes in CO2 fluxes were apparent and
   dependent on the biophysical environment. In the beginning of spring,
   low gross primary productivity (GPP) in lightly flooded zones (LFZ)
   resulted in a positive net ecosystem exchange (NEE), indicating a net
   CO2 source. With the increase in temperature, more species and
   vegetation abundance appeared, and the increased GPP turned the LFZ from
   a net CO2 source into a sink. This transition seemed predominantly
   controlled by the physiological growth of vegetation. The mean NEEs, REs
   and the light-use efficiency (alpha) of the vegetation at HFZ and MFZ
   were significantly higher than those at LFZ and UFZ. Yet the
   coefficients of variation (CV) of NEE and RE at MFZ and HFZ were lower
   than those at LFZ and UFZ. Submergence promoted the emission and uptake
   of CO2 to the atmosphere. Elongated submergence reduced the number of
   species and lowered the spatial variability of the RZ, further lowering
   the variation of the CO2 exchange.

   abundance and range of the native green macroalga Caulerpa filiformis
   have increased over recent decades, apparently associated with sediment
   disturbance. We used field measurements to test hypotheses about
   morphological variability in C. filiformis in relation to local- and
   large-scale environmental variation in water depth, sediment cover and
   latitude. Using a lab experiment, we tested hypotheses about survival
   and morphological change under different sedimentation regimes. In the
   field, C. filiformis fronds were more elongated and less branched when a
   sediment veneer is present and when water depth increased (i.e. reduced
   light). At larger spatial scales, frond length and width decreased with
   increased latitude, but latitude was less important in explaining the
   variation C. filiformis' length than were depth or sedimentation. Our
   lab experiment showed a high tolerance to sedimentation, aided by
   increased investment in vertical growth. This study shows that rapid
   morphological plasticity is a likely key attribute of the spreading
   native macroalga C. filiformis. We argue that having a broad
   environmental tolerance is key to define a species success under
   environmental change.

AB Subtle differences in the pattern of arrangement of types of vertebrae
   and associated median skeletal structures between a benthic and limnetic
   species pair of threespine stickleback from Paxton Lake, British
   Columbia, are typical of those found throughout the range of the
   Gasterosteus aculeatus species complex. We established laboratory
   colonies from just three individuals of each species, and studied the
   effect of three generations of inbreeding on axial morphology. There was
   sufficient divergence in the location of individual elements between
   families to regenerate close to the entire range of axial diversity seen
   in threespine sticklebacks worldwide. Analysis of the patterns of
   variance and covariance between the axial locations of elements provides
   evidence for the action of both meristic and homeotic processes in the
   generation of morphological divergence within each species. Hybrid
   sticklebacks produced by the cross of limnetic and benthic parents tend
   to have intermediate morphologies, with dominance of either parental
   type evident for some elements. Effects of temperature and salinity were
   found to be small in direct comparison with between-family effects, and
   varied according to genetic background. These results demonstrate that
   considerable genetic variation for axial morphology is maintained in
   natural populations of threespine stickleback, and that differences
   between populations may be brought about rapidly by changes in frequency
   of alleles that have coordinated effects along the body axis.

AB Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth & Jones) (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) adults
   were active from May through October during 2002-2006 in southern
   Alberta, Canada. Adults were first captured in May, and populations
   peaked in early June, late July, and late August. The first population
   peak occurred when mean weekly temperatures exceeded 16 degrees C,
   resulting in a variable amount of time for spring emergence. This
   asynchrony in spring emergence accounted for much of the annual
   variation in timing of subsequent population peaks. Peaks were separated
   by an average of 6-7 wk. C. sonorenvis seems to have one overwintering
   generation and two generations during the summer. Abundance was
   correlated among sites located up to 90 km apart. Abundance at a
   rangeland site increased more rapidly with mean weekly temperatures than
   at feedlot sites. The proportion female ranged from 0.68 to 0.83 but
   showed no consistent differences between rangeland and feedlot sites.
   The proportion female declined with distance from a developmental area
   at the rangeland site. Proportion parous was similar among rangeland and
   feedlot sites, and it also declined with distance from a developmental
   area at the rangeland site. The proportion parous increased early in the
   season, fluctuated throughout the mid-season, and increased with cooler
   temperatures in the fall. The proportion parous tended to increase when
   temperatures decreased. Estimates of adult daily survival were generally
   >0.8. Survival declined with temperature, was lowest in midsummer, and
   increased during the fall.

AB High-alpine ecosystems are commonly assumed to be particularly
   endangered by climate warming. Recent research, however, suggests that
   the heterogeneous topography of alpine landscapes provide microclimatic
   niches for alpine plants (i.e. soil temperatures that support the
   establishment and reproduction of species). Whether the microclimatic
   heterogeneity also affects diversity or species interactions on higher
   trophic levels remains unknown. Here we show that variation in mean
   seasonal soil temperature within an alpine pasture is within the same
   range as in plots differing in nearly 500 m in elevation. This
   pronounced heterogeneity of soil temperature among plots affected the
   spatial distribution of flowering plant species in our study area with a
   higher plant richness and cover in warmer plots. This increased plant
   productivity in warmer plots positively affected richness of flower
   visitor taxa as well as interaction frequency. Additionally,
   flower-visitor networks were more generalized in plots with higher plant
   cover. These results suggest that soil temperature directly affects
   plant diversity and productivity and indirectly affects network
   stability. The strong effect of heterogeneous soil temperature on plant
   communities and their interaction partners may also mitigate climate
   warming impacts by enabling plants to track their suitable temperature
   niches within a confined area.

AB Early detection of Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosley) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
   on lettuce is of primary importance for its effective control.
   Temperature thresholds for development of this pest were estimated using
   developmental rates [r(T)] at different constant temperatures (8, 12,
   16, 20 24, 26, and 28 degrees C). Observed developmental rates data and
   temperature were fitted to two linear (Campbell and Muniz and Gil) and a
   nonlinear (Lactin) models. Lower temperature threshold estimated by the
   Campbell model was 3.6 degrees C for apterous, 4.1 degrees C for alates,
   and 3.1 degrees C for both aphid adult morphs together. Similar values
   of the lower temperature threshold were obtained with the Muniz and Gil
   model, for apterous (4.0 degrees C), alates (4.2 degrees C), and both
   adult morphs together (3.7 degrees C) of N. ribisnigri. Thermal
   requirements of N. ribisnigri to complete development were estimated by
   Campbell and Muniz and Gil models for apterous in 125 and 129 DD and for
   both adult morphs together in 143 and 139 DD, respectively. For complete
   development from birth to adulthood, the alate morph needed 15-18 DD
   more than the apterous morph. The lower temperature threshold determined
   by the Lactin model was 5.3 degrees C for alates, 2.3 degrees C for
   apterous, and 1.9 degrees C for both adult morphs together. The optimal
   and upper temperature thresholds were 25.2 and 33.6 degrees C,
   respectively, for the alate morph, 27 and 35.9 degrees C, respectively,
   for the apterous morph, and 26.1 and 35.3 degrees C, respectively, for
   the two adult morphs together. The Campbell model provided the best fit
   to the observed developmental rates data of N. ribisnigri. This
   information could be incorporated in forecasting models of this pest.

AB High shore intertidal ectotherms must withstand temperatures which are
   already close, at or beyond their upper physiological thermal tolerance.
   Their behaviour can provide a relief under heat stress, and increase
   their survival through thermoregulation. Here, we used infrared imaging
   to reveal the thermoregulatory behavioural strategies used by the snail
   Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) on different microhabitats of a high shore
   boulder field in Finistere (western France) in summer. On our study
   site, substrate temperature is frequently greater than L. saxatilis
   upper physiological thermal limits, especially on sun exposed
   microhabitats. To maintain body temperatures within their thermal
   tolerance window, withdrawn snails adopted a flat posture, or elevated
   their shells and kept appended to the rock on the outer lip of their
   aperture with dried mucous (standing posture). These thermal regulatory
   behaviours lowered snail body temperatures on average by 1-2 degrees C.
   Aggregation behaviour had no thermoregulatory effect on L. saxatilis in
   the present study. The occupation of biogenic microhabitats (barnacles)
   was associated with a 1 degrees C decrease in body temperatures.
   Barnacles and micro habitats that experienced low sun exposure, low
   thermal fluctuations and low thermal maxima, could buffer the heat
   extremes encountered at high shore level especially on sun exposed
   microhabitats.

AB Data series for bud burst, beginning of flowering and petal fall for 20
   species of deciduous trees and conifers at four sites in different
   regions of southern Norway have been analysed and related to temperature
   series. On average, the spring phenophases occurred 7 days earlier
   during the period 1971-2005. The most significant linear trends were
   observed for the earliest phases. The trends in this period were
   compared with trends in other periods, the longest one starting in 1927.
   Those starting in cold decades and ending in 2005 were in most instances
   statistically significant, whereas hardly any significant trend appeared
   for series starting in warm decades. This fact showed that the results
   of trend studies are very sensitive to the choice of starting year.
   There were significant decadal variations in 40% of the series. The
   dates of occurrence of the phenophases, varying from the first days of
   May to the first days of June, correlated with seasonal temperature
   series, in most cases strongest to mean temperatures for the seasons
   March-May and April-May. The North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) for
   January and February appeared to have some predictive power for the date
   of occurrence of the recorded phases. The basis for this may be that the
   oscillations described by the index are of importance for the fulfilment
   of physiological chilling requirements needed to break bud dormancy. The
   same genotypes of the trees were grown in region West Norway and in
   Central Norwegian region; during the period 1965-2005 the trends towards
   earlier bud burst were more pronounced and steeper at the western site.

AB We propose a new methodology to identify intra-annual density
   fluctuations in latewood using cell features and relative radial
   position within the latewood of pine trees growing on Corsica, France.
   Climatic forcing of latewood wood anatomical anomalies was analyzed.
   We analyzed latewood anatomical features from Corsican pine (Pinus nigra
   ssp. laricio) of high-elevation sites in Corsica (France) derived from
   digital images of the wood surface. Latewood of each ring during the
   period 1950-2008 was partitioned into ten equal parts P1-P10. Mean
   values of the cell parameters cell lumen area (CLA), radial cell width
   (RCW), radial cell wall thickness (CWT), and modeled latewood density
   (MLD) were calculated for P1-P10. The cellular profiles for each cell
   parameter were subjected to principal component analyses. It was
   possible to quantify macroscopically visible variations of wood anatomy
   like intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) by latewood profiles of
   different cell parameters. A combination of cell parameter
   characteristics including their relative radial position within latewood
   provides a quantification of the cell anatomical variations in an IADF.
   Individual cell parameter chronologies and principal components of cell
   parameter profiles were correlated with climate data to determine the
   climatic forcing on latewood formation. Average cell parameter profiles
   and deviations from the long-term means are able to describe "normal"
   and "anomalous" environmental conditions during latewood formation. Cell
   feature anomalies throughout the latewood during individual years allow
   the reconstruction of past weather conditions with a high temporal
   resolution.

   cryostimulation exposure are not completely known. Thus the aim of this
   study was to evaluate objectively and noninvasively autonomic and
   thermal reactions observed after short exposure to very low
   temperatures. We examined 25 healthy men with mean age 30.1 +/- 3.7
   years and comparable anthropomorphical characteristic. Each subject was
   exposed to cryotherapeutic temperatures in a cryogenic chamber for 3 min
   (approx. -120 degrees C). The cardiovascular and autonomic parameters
   were measured noninvasively with Task Force (R) Monitor. The changes in
   core body temperature were determined with the Vital Sense (R)
   telemetric measurement system. Results show that 3 min to
   cryotherapeutic temperatures causes significant changes in autonomic
   balance which are induced by peripheral and central blood volume
   changes. Cryostimulation also induced changes in core body temperature,
   maximum drop of core temperature was observed 50-60 min after the
   stimulation. Autonomic and thermal reactions to cryostimulation were
   observed up to 6 h after the exposure and were not harmful for examined

AB The genetic structure of 13 populations of the amphiatlantic sea urchin
   Arbacia lixula, as well as temporal genetic changes in three of these
   localities, were assessed using ten hypervariable microsatellite loci.
   This thermophilous sea urchin is an important engineer species
   triggering the formation of barren grounds through its grazing activity.
   Its abundance seems to be increasing in most parts of the Mediterranean,
   probably favoured by warming conditions. Significant genetic
   differentiation was found both spatially and temporally. The main break
   corresponded to the separation of western Atlantic populations from
   those in eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. A less marked, but
   significant differentiation was also found between Macaronesia (eastern
   Atlantic) and the Mediterranean. In the latter area, a signal of
   differentiation between the transitional area (Alboran Sea) and the rest
   of the Mediterranean was detected. However, no genetic structure is
   found within the Mediterranean (excluding Alboran) across the
   Siculo-Tunisian Strait, resulting from either enough gene flow to
   homogenize distance areas or/and a recent evolutionary history marked by
   demographic expansion in this basin. Genetic temporal variation at the
   Alboran Sea is as important as spatial variation, suggesting that
   temporal changes in hydrological features can affect the genetic
   composition of the populations. A picture of genetic homogeneity in the
   Mediterranean emerges, implying that the potential expansion of this
   keystone species will not be limited by intraspecific genetic features
   and/or potential impact of postulated barriers to gene flow in the
   region.

AB Weather extremes have harmful impacts on communities around Lake
   Victoria, where thousands of fishermen die every year because of intense
   night-time thunderstorms. Yet how these thunderstorms will evolve in a
   future warmer climate is still unknown. Here we show that Lake Victoria
   is projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation
   intensification by using new satellite-based observations, a
   high-resolution climate projection for the African Great Lakes and
   coarser-scale ensemble projections. Land precipitation on the previous
   day exerts a control on night-time occurrence of extremes on the lake by
   enhancing atmospheric convergence (74%) and moisture availability (26%).
   The future increase in extremes over Lake Victoria is about twice as
   large relative to surrounding land under a high-emission scenario, as
   only over-lake moisture advection is high enough to sustain
   Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. Our results highlight a major hazard
   associated with climate change over East Africa and underline the need
   for high-resolution projections to assess local climate change.

   measured in 4-year-old Populus tremula L. trees exposed to drought
   stress and different regimes of light exclusion of woody tissues. Under
   well-watered conditions, local P-wt decreased E-A up to 30%. Axial CO2
   diffusion (D-ax) induced by distant P-wt caused an additional decrease
   in E-A of up to 25% and limited xylem [CO2] build-up. Under drought
   stress, absolute decreases in E-A driven by P-wt remained stable,
   denoting that P-wt was not affected by drought. At the end of the dry
   period, when transpiration was low, local P-wt and D-ax offset 20% and
   10% of stem respiration on a daily basis, respectively. These results
   highlight (a) the importance of P-wt for an adequate interpretation of
   E-A measurements and (b) homeostatic P-wt along a drought stress
   gradient, which might play a crucial role to fuel stem metabolism when
   leaf carbon uptake and phloem transport are limited.

AB The study of thermal behavior of fishes provides useful data to enable
   predictions of the effect of climatic change on populations so as to
   ensure good management of fisheries. The Pacific sardine has a complex
   population dynamics; three subpopulation have been proposed (cold,
   temperate and warm).
   We exposed Sardinops sagax caeruleus (temperate sub-population) to two
   different thermal cycles, which were chosen to be consistent with the
   temperatures reported in two distant places Cedros Island (CIc: 18-23
   degrees C) and San Pedro (SPc: 13-18 degrees C).
   The thermal behavior of the SPc and CIc sardines was affected by
   acclimation treatment: the interval of thermal preference was 17.1-19.9
   and 16.0-18.8 degrees C, while the lethal temperatures interval (LT50)
   was 7.7-25.6 and 6.9-24.3 degrees C, and the critical limits CTMax and
   CTMin were 7.1-32.2 and 5.5-30.4 degrees C, respectively.
   The results of thermal behavior showed that sardines of the temperate
   subpopulation are more tolerant to cold; this might suggest that they
   would be more able to survive in California and Oregon than in Baja
   California Sur and the Gulf of California. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB High temperatures can negatively impact the performance and survival of
   organisms, particularly ectotherms. While an organism's response to high
   temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its
   response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of
   past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta
   larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations
   during development affected gene expression both independently and in
   conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene
   expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a
   genetically related field population that have been separated for >300
   generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted
   larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both
   single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could
   decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large
   differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two
   populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific
   transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed
   genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae.
   Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on
   long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat
   elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing
   conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat
   stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the
   particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased
   knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of
   organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the
   development of more accurate thermal performance models.

AB The summer of 2003 was the warmest summer in Europe since the 16th
   century. Its consequences on the fauna of a transitional ecosystem were
   studied through biodiversity, functional and ecological indicators, from
   summer 2002 to winter 2005. The heatwave caused considerable changes in
   the benthic community structure and relative composition, persisting in
   2005. Animal assemblages switched from mollusc- to annelida-dominated.
   Biodiversity and functional indicators captured changes in community
   structure and composition, proving to be powerful tools to detect
   responses related to global warming. Ecological indicators rendered a
   monotonic response oscillating between bad and poor ecological status
   across the study period. The resilience of mollusc biocoenosis resulted
   limited with respect to other taxa, posing concerns about their
   conservation if, as predicted, the frequency of summers as hot as that
   of 2003 will progressively increase to become the norm at the end of

   ml-1 in winter, 1.66 x 10(6) cells ml-1 in June and 1.60 x 10(6) cells
   ml-1 in August. Thymidine incorporation rates were 0.17, 5.0 and 7.8
   pmol l-1 h-1 respectively (all depths included). Mean cell volumes were
   within the ranges 0.026 to 0.090 mum3 in winter, 0.029 to 0.129 mum3 in
   June and 0.018 to 0.051 mum3 in August. The shortest turnover time was
   ca 1 mo in winter and ca 5 d in June and August. Bacterial numbers and
   thymidine incorporation rate showed a positive correlation to
   temperature. Thymidine incorporation rate (growth) and temperature did
   not correlate with mean cell volume. The results indicated that part of
   the bacterioplankton production in the Bothnian Bay was supported by
   allochthonous sources. In addition, the bacterial cell volumes in August
   were probably controlled by predators. However, it is suggested that in
   the Gulf of Bothnia the available resources control bacterioplankton.

AB The effects of seed transfer and climate change on the width and basal
   area of tree rings were studied in 21 provenances of jack pine (Pinus
   banksiana Lamb.) grown in a common-garden plantation in Petawawa,
   Ontario, Canada. Seed-source origin significantly influenced both mean
   tree-ring width and mean annual basal area increment over a 25-year
   growth period (1975-1999). Temperature and precipitation transfer
   functions were developed to predict width and basal area of tree rings
   of the jack pine populations. The best predictors of growth were the
   transfer distances of mean annual maximum daily temperature and annual
   precipitation between the plantation site and the seed origins. Radial
   growth of the jack pine populations was mainly related to temperature at
   seed origin and, to a lesser degree, to precipitation at seed origin.
   Extension of the transfer functions to three sets of independent data
   revealed significant correlations between estimated and predicted mean
   radial growth characteristics. Seed sources of jack pine originating
   from warmer and drier climates than that of the plantation site in
   Petawawa had slightly higher mean ring widths and basal areas than the
   local populations. The application of different climate change scenarios
   derived from general circulation models to the developed transfer
   functions indicated that radial growth of jack pine may decline only if
   significant climate changes occur, which might not happen before the mid
   21st century. Both a higher radial growth of southern seed sources and a
   potential negative effect of a significant temperature increase and
   precipitation decrease in future suggest restricting the northward
   transfer of southern seed sources to less than 1 degrees latitude.
   However, provenance specific differences in survivorship, frost- and
   disease-resistance, and cone serotiny should also be taken into
   consideration. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae) are said to
   have strong dispersal tendencies. Gene flow among these populations is
   estimated to be the theoretical equivalent of no more than one or two
   reproducing flies per generation, thereby raising the hypothesis of
   local regimes of natural selection. Flies were sampled from four
   environmentally diverse locations in Kenya to determine whether
   populations are homogeneous in desiccation tolerance and cuticular
   lipids. Cuticular hydrocarbon fractions known to act as sex pheromones
   do not differ among populations, thereby eliminating sexual selection as
   an isolating mechanism. Cuticular lipid quantities vary among
   populations and are not correlated with prevailing temperatures,
   humidities, and normalized density vegetation indices. Females
   demonstrate a stronger correlation than males between cuticular lipid
   mass and body weight. Desiccation rates also vary among populations, but
   are not correlated with the amounts of cuticular lipid. Chemical
   analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons by gas chromatography-mass
   spectroscopy shows that one of the four populations has more 11,15- and
   11,21-dimethyl-31 hydrocarbon on females. These results are discussed in
   the context of population differences and estimates of gene flow.

AB In high-latitude marine environments, primary producers and their
   consumers show seasonal peaks of abundance in response to annual light
   cycle, water column stability and nutrient availability. Predatory
   species have adapted to this pattern by synchronising life-history
   events such as reproduction with prey availability. However, changing
   temperatures may pose unprecedented challenges by decoupling the
   predator-prey interactions. Here we build a predator-prey model
   accounting for the full life-cycle of fish and zooplankton including
   their phenology. The model assumes that fish production is bottom-up
   controlled by zooplankton prey abundance and match or mismatch between
   predator and prey phenology, and is parameterised based on empirical
   findings of how climate influences phenology and prey abundance. With
   this model, we project possible climate-warming effects on
   match-mismatch dynamics in Arcto-boreal and temperate biomes. We find a
   strong dependence on synchrony with zooplankton prey in the Arcto-boreal
   fish population, pointing towards a possible pronounced population
   decline with warming because of frequent desynchronization with its
   zooplankton prey. In contrast, the temperate fish population appears
   better able to track changes in prey timing and hence avoid strong
   population decline. These results underline that climate change may
   enhance the risks of predator-prey seasonal asynchrony and fish
   population declines at higher latitudes.

   paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), while the temperate species were
   eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr ex. Marsh var. deltoides)
   and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Assessments were conducted on
   seedlings grown from seed sources collected near southern and northern
   range boundaries, respectively. Nighttime rates of leaf dark respiration
   (R-d) at common temperatures, as well as R-d's short-term temperature
   sensitivity (energy of activation, E-o), were assessed for all species
   and gardens twice during a growing season. Little evidence of R-d
   thermal acclimation was observed, despite a 12 degrees C range in
   average air temperature across gardens. Instead, R-d variation at warm
   temperatures was linked most closely with prior leaf photosynthetic
   performance, while R-d variation at cooler temperatures was most
   strongly related to leaf nitrogen concentration. Moreover, E-o
   differences across species and gardens appeared to stem from the
   somewhat independent limitations on warm versus cool R-d. Based on this
   construct, an empirical model relying on R-d estimates from leaf
   photosynthesis and nitrogen concentration explained 55% of the observed
   E-o variation.

   questions about this declining group of vertebrates. Accurate data on
   clutch sizes are required for assessments of geographic variation in
   this life-history trait and an understanding of environmental (e.g.,
   climate change) and genetic impacts on demography among populations. We
   quantified the number of eggs in 469 clutches for 21 of the 27 species
   of anurans that occur in Virginia. Clutch sizes ranged from 116 in
   Pseudacris ocularis to 16,536 in Anaxyrus terrestris. Maximum clutch
   sizes for 11 species exceeded the maximum number reported in the
   literature. Relationships of clutch size to maternal body size were not
   significant for seven species (Gastrophryne carolinensis, Hyla cinerea,
   Hyla femoralis, Hyla squirella, Pseudacris brimleyi, Pseudacris
   crucifer, Pseudacris feriarum), possibly because of small sample sizes,
   but correlations for Anaxyrus americanus, A. terrestris, and Lithobates
   sylvaticus were significantly positive. Maternal body size explained 41%
   to 73% of the variation in clutch size in these latter three species
   with positive correlations. Demographic data from several locations
   within the ranges of widespread North American anurans would allow
   assessment of sources of environmentally and genetically induced
   geographic variation in life-history traits, including clutch size.
   Studies of anuran natural life histories are urgently needed despite the
   fact that such studies are not in vogue or supported by most academic
   institutions and funding agencies.

AB Although actin-based motility drives cell crawling and intracellular
   locomotion of organelles and certain pathogens, the underlying mechanism
   of force generation remains a mystery. Recent experiments demonstrated
   that Listeria exhibit episodes of 5.4-nm stepwise motion corresponding
   to the periodicity of the actin filament subunits, and extremely small
   positional fluctuations during the intermittent pauses [S. C. Kuo and J.
   L. McGrath. 2000. Nature. 407:1026-1029]. These findings suggest that
   motile bacteria remain firmly bound to actin filament ends as they
   elongate, a behavior that appears to rule out previous models for
   actin-based motility. We propose and analyze a new mechanochemical model
   (called the "Lock, Load & Fire" mechanism) for force generation by means
   of affinity-modulated, clamped-filament elongation. During the locking
   step, the filament's terminal ATP-containing subunit binds tightly to a
   clamp situated on the surface of a motile object; in the loading step,
   actin-ATP monomer(s) bind to the filament end, an event that triggers
   the firing step, wherein ATP hydrolysis on the clamped subunit
   attenuates the filament's affinity for the clamp. This last step
   initiates translocation of the new ATP-containing terminus to the clamp,
   whereupon another cycle begins anew. This model explains how
   surface-tethered filaments can grow while exerting flexural or tensile
   force on the motile surface. Moreover, stochastic simulations of the
   model reproduce the signature motions of Listeria. This elongation
   motor, which we term actoclampin, exploits actin's intrinsic ATPase
   activity to provide a simple, high-fidelity enzymatic reaction cycle for
   force production that does not require elongating filaments to
   dissociate from the motile surface. This mechanism may operate whenever
   actin polymerization is called upon to generate the forces that drive
   cell crawling or intracellular organelle motility.

AB The aim of this paper was to develop a structural mechanics (SM) model
   for the microtubules (MTs) in cells. The technique enables one to study
   the configuration effect on the mechanical properties of MTs and enjoys
   greatly improved computational efficiency as compared with molecular
   dynamics simulations. The SM model shows that the Young's modulus has
   nearly a constant value around 0.83GPa, whereas the shear modulus, two
   orders of magnitude lower, varies considerably with the protofilament
   number N and helix-start number S. The dependence of the bending
   stiffness and persistence length on the MT length and protofilament
   number N is also examined and explained based on the continuum mechanics
   theories. Specifically, the SM model is found to be in good agreement
   with available simulation and experiment results, showing its robustness
   in studying the static deformation of MTs and the potential for
   characterizing the buckling and vibration of MTs as well as the
   mechanical behaviour of intermediate and actin filaments.

AB Alpine forest population dynamics are sensitive to climate change.
   Response patterns are complex, and it is still unclear as to whether or
   not population dynamics are species-dependent. In this study, population
   dynamic patterns for alpine timberline Qilian juniper and Qinghai spruce
   tree species in the mid Qilian Mountains were determined from
   approximately 1500 C.E. by applying dendrochronological methods. The
   results showed that these tree species have different forest population
   dynamics. The Qinghai spruce recruitment rate was clearly higher than
   that of Qilian juniper. Furthermore, the temporal population dynamic
   patterns of Qinghai spruce samples taken at different sites were
   consistent whereas those of the Qilian juniper samples were not. Qinghai
   spruce population dynamics were primarily affected by temperature, with
   positive correlations between temperature and recruitment. By contrast,
   with the exception of a positive to negative shift in the relationship
   between temperature and Qilian juniper population dynamics, Qilian
   juniper recruitment significantly decreased when its density reached a
   relatively high level. Moreover, a shift in the temperature-recruitment
   relationship and a decrease in recruitment occurred simultaneously,
   indicating that Qilian juniper population dynamics were affected by both
   temperature and density. Species to species differences were also
   observed when compared with previous studies within the mid Qilian
   Mountains, confirming the existence of species-dependent population
   dynamic patterns. Forest recruitment dynamic patterns and tree
   recruitment-climate relationships may help to provide clues for future
   studies on forest management, conservation and utilization.

AB Although the impacts of climate change and invasive species are
   typically studied in isolation, they likely interact to reduce the
   viability of plant and animal populations. Indeed, invasive species, by
   definition, have succeeded in areas outside of their native range and
   may therefore have higher adaptive capacity relative to native species.
   Nevertheless, the genetic architecture of the thermal niche, which sets
   a limit to the potential for populations to evolve rapidly under climate
   change, has never been measured in an invasive species in its introduced
   range. Here, we estimate the genetic architecture of thermal performance
   in the harlequin beetle (Harmonia axyridis), a Central Asian species
   that has invaded four continents. We measured thermal performance curves
   in more than 400 third-generation offspring from a paternal half-sib
   breeding experiment and analyzed the genetic variance-covariance matrix.
   We show that while the critical thermal limits in this species have an
   additive genetic basis, most components of the thermal performance curve
   have low heritability. Moreover, we found evidence that genetic
   correlations may constrain the evolution of beetles under climate
   change. Our results suggest that some invasive species may have limited
   evolutionary capacity under climate change, despite their initial
   success in colonizing novel environments.

AB Koinobiont parasitoid insects, which maintain intimate and long-term
   relationships with their arthropod hosts, constitute an association of
   ectothermic organisms that is particularly sensitive to temperature
   variations. Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily
   fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature
   range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid
   interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several
   developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina
   boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of
   16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16
   degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C
   constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C,
   which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we
   showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a
   fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A
   fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of
   the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the
   ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we
   demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into
   diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant
   temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant
   temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the
   need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes
   that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is
   particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which
   constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on
   interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant phenology is expected to be sensitive to climate warming. In
   boreal trees, spring flush is primarily temperature driven, whereas
   height growth cessation and autumn leaf senescence are predominantly
   controlled by photoperiod. Cuttings of 525 genotypes from the full range
   of balsam poplar were planted into two common gardens (Vancouver and
   Indian Head, Canada) at similar latitudes, but with differing winter
   temperatures and growing seasons. There was clinal variation in spring
   and, particularly, summer and fall phenology. Bud flush and, despite
   milder climate, bud set and leaf drop were earlier at Vancouver than at
   Indian Head by 44, 28 and 7 d, respectively. Although newly flushed
   growth is insensitive to photoperiod, many genotypes at both sites
   became competent before the summer solstice. At Vancouver, high-latitude
   genotypes set dormant terminal buds in mid-spring. Most other genotypes
   grew until midsummer or set bud temporarily and then experienced a
   second flush. In both gardens and in a growth chamber experiment,
   earlier bud set was associated with reduced height growth and higher
   root/shoot ratios. Shoots attained competency similar to 5 weeks after
   flushing, which would normally prevent dormancy induction before the
   solstice, but may be insufficient if spring advances by more than a few
   weeks.

AB Aims
   Drought affected by atmosphere-ocean cycle is a dominant factor
   influencing tree radial growth of sandy Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris
   var. mongolica) and regional vegetation dynamics in Hulunbuir, China.
   However, historical droughts and its correlations with tree radial
   growth and atmosphere-ocean cycle in this area have been little tested.
   Methods
   We developed tree-ring chronologies of Mongolian pine from Hulunbuir,
   Inner Mongolia, China and analyzed the correlations between tree-ring
   width index, the normalized difference vegetation index and Palmer
   drought severity index (PDSI), then developed a linear model to
   reconstruct the drought variability from 1829 to 2009. Long-term trends
   and its linkages with atmosphere-ocean cycle were performed by the power
   spectral, wavelet and teleconnection analysis.
   Important Findings
   The local moisture variations affected largely the regional vegetation
   dynamics and tree-ring growth of Mongolia pine in the forestgrassland
   transition. Using tree-ring width chronology of Mongolian pine, the
   reconstruction explains 49.2% of PDSI variance during their common data
   period (1951-2005). The reconstruction gives a broad-scale regional
   representation of PDSI in the Hulunbuir area, with drought occurrences
   in the 1850s, 1900s, 1920s, mid-1930s and at the turn of the 21st
   century. Comparisons with other treering drought reconstructions and
   historical records reveal some common drought periods and drying trends
   in recent decades at the northern margin zones of the East Asian summer
   monsoon (EASM). The drying trends in these zones occurred earlier than
   weakening of the EASM. A REDFIT spectral analysis shows significant
   peaks at 7.2, 3.9, 2.7-2.8, 2.4 and 2.2 years with a 0.05 significance
   level, and 36.9, 18.1 and 5.0 years with 0.1 significance level. Wavelet
   analysis also shows similar cycles. Drought variations in the study area
   significantly correlated with sea surface temperatures in the western
   tropical Pacific Ocean and middle and northern Indian Ocean, and the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. This
   suggests a possible linkage with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the
   EASM and the Westerlies.

AB Resource availability constrains energy allocations to competing
   functions such as growth and reproduction, and thus influences animal
   life-histories and population dynamics. Leatherback turtles Dermochelys
   coriacea are critically endangered and exhibit physiological and
   life-history traits unique among marine reptiles. In addition,
   leatherback nesting populations in the North Atlantic (NA) are, on
   average, larger, produce more eggs, exhibit shorter remigration
   intervals (RIs, time between nesting seasons), and generally demonstrate
   more stable population trends than Eastern Pacific (EP) nesting
   leatherback populations. In order to compare energy requirements of
   inter-basin leatherback populations, we estimated costs associated with
   reproduction to calculate the energy budgets of leatherback populations
   from the EP and the NA. Our estimations illustrate that in contrast to
   reported trends in RIs of these populations (EP = 3.7 yr; NA = 2 yr), NA
   leatherbacks should require RIs between 1.5 to 4 times longer than their
   EP counterparts to accumulate sufficient energy to return to their
   nesting beaches for an entire reproductive season. These results
   indicate that resource limitation might lengthen RIs for EP leatherbacks
   compared to NA leatherbacks, thus decreasing the EP population's
   reproductive success and increasing its exposure to risk of
   fisheries-related mortality. We hypothesize that stochastic resource
   availability related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is
   exacerbating the effects of high incidental fisheries mortality,
   resulting in plummeting EP leatherback populations. Therefore,
   management strategies for fisheries should allow little, if any,
   mortality of Pacific leatherbacks if there is to be any reasonable hope
   for recovery of this population.

AB Fish have a remarkable amount of variation in their swimming
   performance, from within species differences to diversity among major
   taxonomic groups. Fish swimming is a complex, integrative phenotype and
   has the ability to plastically respond to a myriad of environmental
   changes. The plasticity of fish swimming has been observed on
   whole-organismal traits such as burst speed or critical swimming speed,
   as well as underlying phenotypes such as muscle fiber types, kinematics,
   cardiovascular system, and neuronal processes. Whether the plastic
   responses of fish swimming are beneficial seems to depend on the
   environmental variable that is changing. For example, because of the
   effects of temperature on biochemical processes, alterations of fish
   swimming in response to temperature do not seem to be beneficial. In
   contrast, changes in fish swimming in response to variation in flow may
   benefit the fish to maintain position in the water column. In this
   paper, we examine how this plasticity in fish swimming might evolve,
   focusing on environmental variables that have received the most
   attention: temperature, habitat, dissolved oxygen, and carbon dioxide
   variation. Using examples from previous research, we highlight many of
   the ways fish swimming can plastically respond to environmental
   variation and discuss potential avenues of future research aimed at
   understanding how plasticity of fish swimming might evolve. We consider
   the direct and indirect effects of environmental variation on swimming
   performance, including changes in swimming kinematics and suborganismal
   traits thought to predict swimming performance. We also discuss the role
   of the evolution of plasticity in shaping macroevolutionary patterns of
   diversity in fish swimming.

AB Countergradient variation in norms of reaction can dampen the direct
   effects of environmental influences on phenotypic traits, allowing
   phenotypic similarity among populations despite exposure to different
   environmental conditions. Such norms of reaction may occur at any phase
   of the life-history (e.g. growth rates during both embryonic and
   postembryonic stages may influence geographical variation in adult body
   size). We collected gravid female lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) from
   northern (Indiana), central (Mississippi), and southern (Florida)
   populations, spanning almost the full latitudinal range of the species.
   Adult females from the southern population were smaller. Intrinsic
   growth rates of hatchlings were higher for the central population than
   for the other two populations. This pattern does not parallel the
   countergradient variation previously found in embryonic developmental
   rates among these populations. Earlier hatching enhanced survival rates
   of juveniles to a similar degree among populations, although juvenile
   survival rates in the field generally increase with latitude in this
   species. Our data reveal geographical variation in the ways in which
   intrinsic developmental/growth rates and survival shift during ontogeny,
   and suggest that latitudinal patterns in adult body size (such as
   Bergmann's rule) can result from both faster growth, and longer periods
   of growth. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of

AB We studied five reproductive attributes (fruit production and volume,
   seed content and weight, and seed germination) of different populations
   of Campanula species occurring along the elevation gradient of Mt
   Olympos, the highest mountain of Greece (2917 m), in order to examine
   whether and how they change with elevation, and if there are trade-offs
   among them. We also studied flower and fruit (reproductive) losses and
   population features in order to estimate whether there might be a threat
   to the survival of Campanula species on Mt Olympos. The genus is
   represented by nine species, ranging from cosmopolitan to steno-endemic.
   All species were found non-autogamous, and hence they depend on
   pollinators for their sexual reproduction. At the genus level, there is
   a trade-off between seed content per fruit and seed weight. At the
   species level, this is manifested only for C. glomerata, which produces
   the heaviest seeds, far exceeding all other species, and for C.
   spatulata, represented on Mt Olympos by two elevation distinct
   subspecies. Changes of the reproductive attributes are not continuous
   all along the elevation gradient at the genus level nor are they
   monotonic at the species level. Nevertheless, upland Campanula
   populations (>= 1500 m) produce fewer fruits per individual, containing
   fewer but heavier seeds than lowland populations. This indicates a
   transition from 'r' to 'K' strategies, from low to high elevations,
   respectively. The patterns of change of reproductive attributes indicate
   prevalence of phylogenetic over environmental constraints. Laboratory
   tests showed that for many populations germinability is high at 15
   degrees C, but there are both inter- and intraspecific differences
   regarding temperature optima. Ecotypic variation among populations of
   the same species at different elevations was evident; populations from
   higher elevations had lower optima and vice versa. Reproductive losses,
   ranging from zero to over 90%, occurred mainly at the stage of fruit
   maturation; grazing by sheep and goats was the usual cause. Though such
   losses might affect the short-lived species (the annual C. sparsa and
   the biennial C. lingulata), which depend entirely on fruit maturation
   and seed dispersal for their reproduction, there does not seem to be a
   serious threat to the survival of Campanula species on the mountain.

AB Increases in the frequency, severity and duration of temperature
   extremes are anticipated in the near future. Although recent work
   suggests that changes in temperature variation will have
   disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean,
   much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of
   mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine-grained climate
   projections (2050-2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic
   invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple
   model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone
   differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation,
   and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show
   increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of
   mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with
   temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work
   highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to
   incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and
   projecting performance.

   this study fills a gap in our understanding of this part of southern
   Chile. The aim of this study was to reconstruct the environmental and
   climatic history of the last 1000 years of Lake Pastahue through a
   multi-proxy sediment core analysis. The 1-m-long core was subsampled
   every centimeter for the organic matter, magnetic susceptibility,
   grain-size distribution, and biological indicator (pollen, chironomids)
   analyses. The age model was constructed from Pb-210, Cs-137, and C-14
   activity. Pollen results revealed a North Patagonian forest composition
   represented by Nothofagus, Weinmannia, Drimys, Tepualia, Myrtaceae,
   Poaceae, and Pteridophyta. The abundance of Rumex and Pinus in the most
   recent part of the pollen assemblage reflects a clear anthropogenic
   impact. The sedimentological parameters and chironomid assemblage show
   similar variations, which highlight changes in the trophic state of the
   lake. The changes observed in all proxies suggest the influence of
   climate events such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA) and Little
   Ice Age' (LIA). The variations observed since the beginning of the 20th
   century could be the result of the combined effect of anthropogenic
   activities and the increase in temperature recorded in south-central
   Chile and Patagonia.

AB Although a large number of recent ecological studies have focused on
   freshwater bacterioplankton populations, knowledge of the primary
   factors influencing bacterial communities in urban rivers is limited.
   Bacterial community structure in three rivers located in Shanghai city
   was studied over a 1-year period using denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE). Subsurface samples were collected every 2 months
   from two study sites in each river. Water was characterized when
   biological samples were collected by measuring temperature, pH, chloride
   ion, total dissolved solids (TDS), total N and total P. complex DGGE
   band patterns indicated high bacterial diversity in the rivers. Analysis
   of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that variation of the bacterial
   communities was higher between rivers than it was between samples from
   the same river. When evaluated using principal component analysis,
   samples collected during warmer months from any particular river tended
   to group together while cold-season samples generally clustered,
   suggesting significant seasonal impacts. Redundancy analysis was used to
   identify relationships between environmental factors and bacterial
   community composition in each individual river. Temperature, TDS, pH, TP
   and salt concentration were all identified as being related to bacterial
   community structure, with temperature being the most influential

   community composition was different in the three different rivers. Even
   though the rivers were located in heavily disturbed urban ecosystems,
   temperature was the major driver of bacterial community composition,

AB Natural nests of egg-laying birds and reptiles exhibit substantial
   thermal variation, at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Rates and
   trajectories of embryonic development are highly sensitive to
   temperature, favouring an ability of embryos to respond adaptively (i.e.
   match their developmental biology to local thermal regimes). Spatially,
   thermal variation can be significant within a single nest (top to
   bottom), among adjacent nests (as a function of shading, nest depth
   etc.), across populations that inhabit areas with different weather
   conditions, and across species that differ in climates occupied and/or
   nest characteristics. Thermal regimes also vary temporally, in ways that
   generate differences among nests within a single population (e.g. due to
   seasonal timing of laying), among populations and across species.
   Anthropogenic activities (e.g. habitat clearing, climate change) add to
   this spatial and temporal diversity in thermal regimes. We review
   published literature on embryonic adaptations to spatio-temporal
   heterogeneity in nest temperatures. Although relatively few taxa have
   been studied in detail, and proximate mechanisms remain unclear, our
   review identifies many cases in which natural selection appears to have
   fine-tuned embryogenesis to match local thermal regimes. Developmental
   rates have been reported to differ between uppermost versus lower eggs
   within a single nest, between eggs laid early versus late in the season,
   and between populations from cooler versus warmer climates. We identify
   gaps in our understanding of thermal adaptations of early (embryonic)
   phases of the life history, and suggest fruitful opportunities for
   future research.

AB This article documents the development of a precisely dated and
   well-replicated long regional tree-ring width dating chronology for
   Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom.) from the northeastern
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It involves specimens from 22 archeological
   sites, 24 living tree sites, and 5 standing snags sites in the eastern
   and northeastern Qaidam Basin, northwestern China. The specimens were
   cross-dated successfully among different groups of samples and among
   different sites. Based on a total of 1438 series from 713 trees, the
   chronology covers 3585 years and is the longest chronology by far in
   China. Comparisons with chronologies of the same tree species about 200
   kin apart suggest that this chronology can serve for dating purposes in
   a region larger than the study area. This study demonstrates the great
   potential of Qilian juniper for dendrochronological research.

AB A strong relationship between appearance dates and temperature has been
   demonstrated over two decades for most British butterflies. Given this
   relationship over time, this paper tests whether comparable spatial
   trends in timing are also apparent. A major survey of British
   butterflies is used to calculate mean sighting dates of adults across
   the country, and these are compared with geographic patterns in
   temperature. With the use of regression techniques, we calculated
   latitudinal (south-north) and longitudinal (east-west) gradients in
   sighting date and temperature. The majority of butterflies appear later
   in the east of Britain where temperatures are lower during summer, but
   not the rest of the year. Most butterflies are also seen later in the
   cooler north of the country, by upto 3-4 days/100 km. However, no
   geographical relationship between temperature and timing of appearance
   was detected for over a third of the species analysed, suggesting their
   populations may be adapted to their local climates. We suggest possible
   mechanisms for this and discuss the implications of such adaptation for
   the ability of butterfly species to respond to rapid climate warming.

AB Reptiles are important model systems for examining the effect of
   temperature during development on the phenotype of individuals after
   hatching or birth. To assess whether squamate embryos exhibit adaptive
   variation in thermal biology, we derived three parameters: an index of
   developmental rate (DRI), the upper thermal limit for successful
   incubation, and the lower thermal limit for development for 28 species
   of lizard and 12 species of snake. The associations between
   developmental parameters and climatic and life-history variables were
   examined using both conventional statistics and phylogenetically
   controlled analyses. Residual DRI (i.e. DRI corrected for stage at
   oviposition and hatchling mass) was strongly associated with
   phylogenetic relationship. By contrast, the upper limit for development
   was negatively related to the amount of precipitation during the warmest
   quarter of the year, and the lower thermal limit for development was
   positively related to temperature during the warmest quarter of the year
   and the activity body temperatures of adults. These latter observations
   indicate that embryonic thermal physiology is adapted to large-scale
   environmental patterns, and that global climate change will impact
   embryonic development directly through impacts on nest temperature per
   se, as well as indirectly through impacts on the ability of gravid
   females to select suitable nest sites. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of

AB Knowledge of the long-term frequency and intensity of drought events in
   an area is crucial since drought has adverse effects on natural
   ecosystems, food security, economy, society, and civilization. We
   developed a 405 year long (1611-2015C.E.) tree-ring chronology of Pinus
   wallichiana (Blue pine) from the Dolpo area of the trans-Himalayan
   region in Nepal to reconstruct drought variability in this remote
   region. Correlation analysis revealed significant positive relationships
   with February-August precipitation, but negative correlations with
   temperature. High positive correlations with the self-calibrated Palmer
   drought severity index (scPDSI) confirmed that moisture availability
   during the early growing season and full growing season is the primary
   limiting factor for Blue pine tree growth in the trans-Himalayan region.
   We used a linear regression model between our tree-ring record and
   regional climate data to reconstruct a 319-year long (1697-2015C.E.)
   February-August scPDSI series. This reconstruction accounts for 39.4% of
   the total variance in actual sePDSI over the calibration period
   (1957-2015C.E.). The reconstruction showed that the area was under
   slightly dry conditions for most of the reconstructed period, with below
   normal scPDSI values. An extreme drought was observed in the year 1707.
   Also, the years 1705, 1706, 1784, 1786, 1809, 1810, 1813, 1821, 1849,
   1858, 1861, 1909, 1967, 2006, and 2009 experienced severe drought
   conditions. Consecutive years with moderate drought were 1702-1706,
   1783-1789, 1796-1798, 1812-1814, 1816-1827, 1846-1848, 1856-1864,
   1873-1877, 1879-1882, 1899-1901, 1908-1911, and 1967-1968. Three
   historic mega-drought events that occurred in Asia were also captured in
   our reconstruction: Strange Parallels drought (1756-1768), the East
   India drought (1790-1796), and the late Victorian Great Drought
   (1876-1878). Very few wet years (1776-1979, 1989, 1991, and 2003) were
   observed during the reconstruction period. Power spectrum analysis
   revealed drought variability at frequencies of 2.0-2.5, 3.0, 12.0, and
   128 years, suggesting that drought in the region might be linked to
   broad-scale atmospheric oceanic variabilities such as the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal
   Oscillation (AMO). The results not only improve our understanding on
   regional drought variability, but are also helpful to make decisions on
   adaptation measures for protecting the marginal communities of the
   trans-Himalayan region from the anticipated adverse impacts of future
   droughts.

AB Temperature has a major influence on the rate of embryonic development
   in ectothermic organisms. While incubation experiments unambiguously
   show that constant high temperature accelerates development and shortens
   embryonic life, studies on the effect of fluctuating temperatures have
   generated contradictory results. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) occur at
   latitudes and altitudes that are unusually cool for an oviparous
   reptile. In these cool climates females typically lay their eggs in
   heat-generating anthropogenic microhabitats that provide either a highly
   fluctuating (compost piles) or a relatively constant (manure heaps)
   thermal nesting environment. A laboratory experiment with fluctuating
   and constant incubation temperatures mimicking those recorded in such
   nests in the field showed that this nest-site dichotomy influences the
   development of the embryos, and the morphology and locomotor performance
   of the hatchlings. The incubation period increased at fluctuating
   temperatures and the fact that the rate of embryonic development showed
   a decelerating pattern with temperature suggests that periods of low
   temperature had a relatively larger influence on average development
   than periods of high temperature. Our study demonstrates how a dichotomy
   in the nesting environments available to female grass snakes in cool
   climates can affect variation in the duration of the incubation period
   and offspring phenotypes in ways that may have consequences for fitness.

AB Unlike birds and mammals, in many reptiles the temperature experienced
   by a developing embryo deter mines its gonadal sex. To understand how
   temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) evolves, we must first
   determine the nature of genetic variation for sex ratio. Here, we
   analyze among-family variation for sex ratio in three TSD species: the
   American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis), the common snapping
   turtle (Chelydra serpentina), and the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta).
   Significant family effects and significant temperature effects were
   detected in all three species. In addition, family-by-temperature
   interactions were evident in the alligator and the snapping turtle, but
   not in the painted turtle. Overall, the among-family variation detected
   in this study indicates potential for sex-ratio evolution in at least
   three reptiles with TSD. Consequently, climate change scenarios that are
   posited on the presumption that sex-ratio evolution in TSD reptiles is
   genetically constrained may require reevaluation.

AB Wolbachia can profoundly influence the survival, reproduction, and
   defenses of insect hosts. These interactions could potentially be
   harnessed for managing pests or insect-transmitted diseases. Diaphorina
   citri Kuwayama is a phloem-feeding pest capable of transmitting the
   putative causal agent of citrus greening, Candidatus Liberibacter
   asiaticus (CLas). Like many insects, D. citri is also infected with
   Wolbachia (wDi). Recent studies indicate that the relative abundance of
   wDi could be associated with the abundance of CLas, and that wDi may
   contribute to regulating expression of phage lytic cycle genes in CLas,
   suggesting the need for better understanding of wDi biology in general.
   This study investigated the genetic diversity of wDi among D. citri in
   populations spanning eleven countries and two U.S. territories. Six
   Wolbachia genes, wsp, coxA, fbpA, ftsZ, gatB, and hcpA, were sequenced
   and compared across samples. Two prevalent wDi strains were identified
   across the samples, and screening of clone libraries revealed possible
   coinfection of wDi strains in specific populations. D. citri
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (mtCOI) were more
   divergent between D. citri populations that were infected with different
   wDi strains or had different infection statuses (single infection vs.
   coinfection). While we could not eliminate the possibility that maternal
   transmission may contribute to such patterns, it is also possible that
   wDi may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in their host. These findings
   should contribute to the understanding of wDi population ecology, which
   may facilitate manipulation of this endosymbiont for management of
   citrus greening disease worldwide.

   (1.2-animals/m(2)) and biomass (4.4-9.4 g/m(2)) of T. sarmaticus at the
   sites where there was no, or minimal, exploitation of animals were not
   significantly different (P < 0.001). However, the largest animals (up to
   110 mm shell length) were found at the unexploited site, an offshore
   island. The lowest density (0.2 animals/m(2)) and biomass (0.4 g/m(2))
   of T. sarmaticus was recorded at the site where the exploitation of this
   gastropod was intense. In addition, no animals of a legally exploitable
   size (> 70 mm shell length) were found. It is suggested that intense
   over-exploitation is threatening the population at this site.

AB Monitoring permafrost and active layer is essential for prognostic
   research of future climate scenarios. Although biotic factors have a
   prominent role in active layer behavior, apart from vegetation effects,
   their influence remains little investigated. It is generally assumed
   that frozen ground exerts influence on nesting fauna, whereas, on the
   other hand, land colonization by birds, such as penguins can also
   interfere with the soil thermal regime. However, to our knowledge, no
   studies report on permafrost and active layer regime changes under
   penguin activity. We present a comparative study of two adjacent sites
   located in Hope Bay, one representing an active penguin rookery -S1, and
   another, an adjacent abandoned site currently vegetated-S2. Soil
   temperature and water content, and air temperature were monitored hourly
   from 2009 to 2011. Current penguin activity and the resulting deposition
   of guano during spring and summer in S1 is an important factor for
   explaining the higher number of thaw degree days due to direct physical
   impact and chemical reactions caused by rapid guano decomposition. In
   the vegetated S2 site, the snow pack listed longer, showing the highest
   mean minimum temperature and larger thermal insulation, as well as
   larger FDD than those found in the bare soil of the active rookery (S1),
   and lower n-F, due to greater thermal insulation. Penguins played a
   significant role in changing the active layer depth and thermal regime,
   and represent a neglected actor on the ground thermal regime in
   Antarctic terrestrial environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Major conifer species with a widespread geographic distribution are
   growing under diverse climatic conditions. For such species, populations
   in regions with low resource availability, where producing additional
   cones is costly, presumably have more individuals that produce larger,
   highly viable cones with a higher resource-use efficiency. Geographic
   variations in cone characteristics (cone and seed size, seed production
   and productivity per cone) were examined for 28 Pinus densiflora natural
   populations (628 trees) across the species' distribution in Japan. The
   degree of phenotypic differentiation across populations (P-ST) varied
   among the ten characteristics investigated. The average P-ST value
   (0.139) was higher than the previously reported neutral genetic
   variation of the species (F-ST = 0.013). The more northeastern
   populations produced cones of larger size (in length, width and mass),
   had higher seed production (number of filled seeds, seed mass per cone)
   and had higher seed productivity (indicators for seed production per
   cone development cost). A generalized linear mixed model showed that
   geographic variation in cone size and seed productivity per cone of
   populations was correlated negatively with annual solar radiation and
   mean temperature. The larger cone size and higher seed productivity per
   cone observed in northeastern populations support the hypothesis of
   higher resource-use efficiency, and could result from a genetic or
   plastic response under lower temperature and less radiation.

   dispersal-related traits (wing: abdomen length ratio and aspect ratio).
   This result suggests that proximity to range margin alone does not
   account for variations in damselfly morphology, but that the rate of
   range expansion may also be important in determining variation.

   migration (DVM) of Crangon septemspinosa Say, 1818 on and around Georges
   Bank, Northwest Atlantic, between 1995 and 1999. Both juveniles and
   adults were found to undergo DVM, being distributed within the lower
   water column (and perhaps on or in the bottom) during the day, and
   distributed throughout the water column at night, with higher abundances
   seen in all depth strata at night. Differences in vertical distribution
   were also found based on location and chlorophyll concentration for
   juveniles, but no effects were seen of season, salinity, temperature,
   lunar periodicity, year, or copepod prey for either juveniles or adults.
   Variation in vertical distribution and DVM were only moderately well
   explained (50% of the total variance) by the above factors, suggesting
   that some other factor(s) not measured by us (e.g., predation) were
   potentially also controlling the vertical distribution and diel
   migration of C. septemspinosa on Georges Bank.

AB Norway spruce has experienced unprecedented forest declines in recent
   decades, leading to extensive salvage logging. Currently, because of the
   conversion of conifer forests into more natural mixed forests in Central
   Europe, spruce has begun to be replaced, mainly by European beech. The
   frequently discussed changing climate has a crucial effect on the
   vitality of both species. To improve our understanding of spruce and
   beech responses to climate change, including more frequent temperature
   and drought extremes, we investigated the impact of temporal climate
   variability on the growth of these species along an elevation gradient.
   In total, 79 spruce and 90 beech trees were used to build species
   specific tree-ring width chronologies representing the altitudinal range
   in which both species grow (450, 650, 800, and 950 m as) under the
   conditions of the Czech Republic. The climate growth relationship
   indicates strong dependence of spruce and beech tree-ring growth on
   spring temperature (Mar-May) at all sites and summer (Jun-Aug) water
   availability at lower altitudes. Significant temporal shifts in the
   climate growth relationships of both species indicate an increasing
   negative effect of summer temperature and positive effect of water
   availability in summer. The increasing drought and temperature
   sensitivity of both species suggest a significant impact of the
   predicted climate change on such forest ecosystems. Discussion
   emphasizes the current importance of adaptive forest management
   strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxygen consumption by eggs of European pond turtle was determined at two
   constant incubation temperatures of 25 and 28 degrees C during the
   second half of embryogenesis. During development at both temperatures,
   the rate of oxygen consumption initially increased to remain constant
   during the last quarter of embryogenesis. The difference between the
   rates of oxygen consumption at these temperatures decreased during the
   studied period. The coefficient Q(10) for the rate of oxygen consumption
   decreased from 9 to 1.7. At an incubation temperature of 28 degrees C,
   the changes in the rate of oxygen consumption in response to a
   short-term temperature decrease to 25 degrees C or increase to 30
   degrees C depended on the developmental stage and were most pronounced
   at the beginning of the studied period. During late embryonic and first
   2.5 months of postembryonic development, the rate of oxygen consumption
   did not significantly differ after such temperature changes. The
   regulatory mechanisms formed during embryonic development are proposed
   to maintain the level of oxygen consumption during temperature changes.

AB Long-term changes in coral cover for the Caribbean and the
   Pacific/Southeast Asia regions (PSEA) have proven extremely useful in
   assessing the main drivers, magnitude and timescales of change. The one
   major coral reef region where such assessments have not been made is the
   Indian Ocean (IO). Here, we compiled coral cover survey data from across
   the IO into a database of similar to 2,000 surveys from 366 coral reef
   sites collected between 1977 and 2005. The compilation shows that the
   1998 mass coral bleaching event was the single most important and
   widespread factor influencing the change in coral cover across the
   region. The trend in coral cover followed a step-type function driven by
   the 1998 period, which differs from findings in the Caribbean and the
   PSEA regions where declines have been more continuous and mostly began
   in the 1980s. Significant regional variation was observed, with most
   heterogeneity occurring during and after 1998. There was a significant
   relationship between cover and longitude for all periods, but the
   relationship became stronger in the period immediately after 1998.
   Before 1998, highest coral cover was observed in the central IO region,
   while this changed to the eastern region after 1998. Coral cover and
   latitude displayed a significant U-shaped relationship immediately after
   1998, due to a large decrease in cover in the northern-central regions.
   Post-1998 coral cover was directly correlated to the impact of the
   disturbance; areas with the lowest mortality having the highest cover
   with India-Sri Lanka being an outlier due to its exceptionally high
   recovery. In 1998, reefs within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were more
   heavily impacted than unmanaged reefs, losing significantly greater
   total cover. MPA recovery was greater such that no differences were
   observed by 2001-2005. This study indicates that the regional patterns
   in coral cover distribution in the IO are driven mainly by episodic and
   acute environmental stress.

AB Most organisms experience thermal variability in their environment;
   however, our understanding of how organisms cope with this variation is
   under-developed. For example, in organisms with temperature-dependent
   sex determination (TSD), an inability to predict sex ratios under
   fluctuating incubation temperatures in the field hinders predictions of
   how species with TSD will fare in a changing climate. To better
   understand how sex determination is affected by thermal variation, we
   incubated Trachemys scripta eggs using a "heat wave" design, where
   embryos experienced a male-producing temperature of 25 +/- 3 degrees C
   for the majority of development and varying durations at a
   female-producing temperature of 29.5 +/- 3 degrees C during the window
   of development when sex is determined. We compared the sex ratios from
   these incubation conditions with a previous data set that utilized a
   similar heat wave design, but instead incubated eggs at a male-producing
   temperature of 27 +/- 3 degrees C but utilized the same female-producing
   temperature of 29.5 +/- 3 degrees C. We compared the sex ratio reaction
   norms produced from these two incubation conditions and found that,
   despite differences in average temperatures, both conditions produced
   50:50 sex ratios after similar to 8days of exposure to female-producing
   conditions. This emphasizes that sex can be determined in just a few
   days at female-producing conditions and that sex determination is
   relatively unaffected by temperatures outside of this short window.
   Further, these data demonstrate the reduced accuracy of the constant
   temperature equivalent model (the leading method of predicting sex
   ratios) under thermally variable temperatures. Conceptualizing sex
   determination as the number of days spent incubating at female-producing
   conditions rather than an aggregate statistic is supported by the
   mechanistic underpinnings of TSD, helps to improve sex ratio estimation
   methods, and has important consequences for predicting how species with
   TSD will fare in a changing climate.

AB Drosophila ananassae has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane
   localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this
   desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response
   to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we
   investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying
   environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed
   change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of D. ananassae in five
   mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000-2010). We document
   invasion of D. ananassae to montane localities and increase in frequency
   of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light)
   remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult
   acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various
   environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist
   for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased
   after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while
   tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance
   of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no
   influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a
   possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation
   of D. ananassae to montane localities. Future experiments should be
   carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of
   low versus high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is
   assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of D.
   ananassae.

AB Heterosis is defined as the increased vigour of hybrids in comparison to

   thaliana generated by reciprocally crossing either C24 or Col with six
   other parental accessions (Can, Co, Cvi, Ler, Rsch, Te) that differ
   widely in their freezing tolerance. The crosses differed in the degree
   of heterosis for freezing tolerance, both in the non-acclimated state
   and after a 14 d cold acclimation period. Crosses with C24 showed more
   heterosis than crosses with Col, and heterosis was stronger in
   acclimated than in non-acclimated plants. Leaf content of soluble sugars
   and proline showed more deviation from mid-parent values in crosses
   involving C24 than in those involving Col, and deviations were larger in
   acclimated than in non-acclimated plants. There were significant
   correlations between the content of different sugars and leaf freezing
   tolerance, as well as between heterosis effects in freezing tolerance
   and sugar content. Flavonoid content and composition varied between
   accessions, and between non-acclimated and acclimated plants. In the
   crosses, large deviations from the mid-parent values in the contents of
   different flavonols occurred, and there were strikingly strong
   correlations between both flavonol content and freezing tolerance, and
   between heterosis effects in freezing tolerance and flavonol content.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the supposed influence of pedal
   rate on the diurnal fluctuation of the time to exhaustion from
   high-intensity exercise. Eleven male cyclists performed three tests at
   06: 00 h and three at 18: 00 h at a free pedal rate (FPR) and two
   imposed pedal rates (80% and 120% of the FPR). They performed the tests
   until exhaustion using a power output corresponding to 95% maximal power
   (P-max). Time to exhaustion, rectal temperature, oxygen consumption
   (VO2), M. quadriceps, vastus medialis, M. biceps femoris
   electromyographic Root Mean Square activity rise (RMS slope), and blood
   lactate concentration were measured. The mean time to exhaustion
   recorded at 18: 00 h (270.6 +/- 104.8 sec) was greater than at 06: 00 h
   (233.9 +/- 84.9 sec). The time to exhaustion was significantly greater
   when the pedal rate was imposed at 80% versus 120% FPR. The blood
   lactate concentration and absolute core temperature at the point of
   exhaustion were significantly higher during tests done at 18: 00 h.
   There was no diurnal variation in core temperature increase, VO2, and
   RMS slope. The time-of-day effect for every variable did not depend on
   pedal rate. Diurnal variations in maximal aerobic endurance cannot be
   explained by a change in aerobic metabolism or in muscular fatigue. The
   origin of the diurnal variation in the time to exhaustion is likely to
   lie in greater participation in anaerobic metabolism. Also, the
   influence of temperature on neuromuscular functioning as an explanation
   for the diurnal variation in performance cannot be excluded in this
   study. The hypothesis on the basis of which pedal rate would influence
   diurnal variations in time to exhaustion in cycling was not validated by
   this research.

   Suborganellar examination indicated that there are two forms of the
   chlpsHsp, a 25-Ku and a 22-Ku form. Protease treatment of isolated
   subchloroplast fractions (thylakoid grana vs, stroma) demonstrated that
   the 22-Ku chlpsHsp form is found in the thylakoid lumen.
   Co-immunoprecipitation of the chlpsHsp using a concentration of Triton
   X-100 below its critical micelle concentration showed that this protein
   associates with proteins of Photosystem II. Coimmunoprecipitation of the
   chlpsHsp using a concentration of Triton X-100 significantly above its
   critical micelle concentration showed that this protein specifically
   interacts with proteins of the thermolabile Oxygen Evolving Complex of
   Photosystem II. The chlpsHsp does not reactivate heat-denatured
   Photosystem II, bur instead protects this complex from damage during

   in local and climate variables were correlated with 48 years of albacore
   troll catch per unit effort (CPUE) in 1 degrees latitude/longitude
   cells, using threshold Generalized Additive Mixed Models (tGAMMs). Model
   terms were included to account for non-stationary and spatially variable
   effects of the intervening covariates on albacore CPUE. Results indicate
   that SST had a positive and spatially variable effect on albacore CPUE,
   with increasingly positive effects to the North, while PDO had an
   overall negative effect. Although albacore CPUE increased with SST both
   before and after a threshold year of 1986, such effect geographically
   shifted north after 1986. This is the first study to demonstrate the
   non-stationary spatial dynamics of albacore tuna, linked with a major
   shift of the North Pacific. Results imply that if ocean temperatures
   continue to increase, US west coast fisher communities reliant on
   commercial albacore fisheries are likely to be negatively affected in
   the southern areas but positively affected in the northern areas, where
   current albacore landings are highest.

AB El Nino and La Nina climatic oscillations have dramatic effects on

   marine birds, El Nino phenomenon drastically increases their mortality
   and reduces their reproductive success. In terrestrial ecosystems, the
   lack of long-term longitudinal data limits our understanding of the
   impact of El Nino and La Nina on bird populations and communities. We
   analyzed changes in abundance of frugivorous (large, medium, and small)
   and nectarivorous birds on three tropical forest types (lowland,
   premontane and montane) during El Nino, La Nina and neutral years using
   data from 16 Christmas' Bird Counts in Costa Rica. Abundance of large
   and medium size frugivores increased during La Nina events, and the
   abundance of nectarivores during El Nino in the lowland forest, but
   neither of these events affected the abundance of small frugivores. In
   the montane forest, abundance of all four bird groups increased during
   El Nino, but decreased during La Nina events. Abundance of large, and
   small frugivores increased in the premontane forest during La Nina
   events, but other bird groups were not affected by La Nina. The
   abundance of small frugivores also increased during El Nino. We
   hypothesize that changes in abundance of frugivores and nectarivores
   during La Nina and El Nino events is probably correlated with
   fluctuations in food resources as it has been reported for other
   terrestrial tropical ecosystems.

AB Resequencing in resistant cultivar 'Nure' and structural comparison with
   the same region of susceptible 'Morex' was performed in order to gain a
   better insight into barley Frost-resistance-H2 locus. Accurate
   annotation showed copy number variation (CNV) in the proximal part of
   the locus. In 'Nure', two exact copies of the HvCBF4-HvCBF2A region and
   one of the HvCBF4-HvCBF2B segment were observed, while in 'Morex' the
   corresponding region harboured a single HvCBF4-HvCBF2A (22 kb) segment.
   Abundance and diversity of repetitive element classes, gene function
   gain/losses, regulatory motifs and SNPs in gene sequences were
   identified. An expression study of key HvCBFs with/without CNV on
   selected genotypes contrasting for frost resistance and estimated
   HvCBF4-HvCBF2B copy number (2-10 copies) was also performed. Under light
   stimulus at warm temperature (23 degrees C), CNV of HvCBF2A and HvCBF4
   correlated with their expression levels and reported frost resistance of
   genotypes; moreover, expression levels of HvCBF2A and HvCBF14 were
   strongly correlated (r = 0.908, p < 0.01). On the other hand, frost
   resistance correlated to HvCBF14 expression (r = 0.871, p < 0.01) only
   after cold induction (6 degrees C) in the dark. A complex interplay of
   HvCBFs expression levels under different light/temperature stimuli is
   discussed in light of CNV and presence/number of regulatory elements
   that integrate different signal transduction pathways.

AB We investigated the spatio-temporal and environmental factors that
   affect the distribution and abundance of wintering anchovy and
   quantifies the influences of these factors. Generalized additive models
   (GAMs) were developed to examine the variation in species distribution
   and abundance with a set of spatiotemporal and oceanographic factors,
   using data collected by bottom trawl surveys and remote sensing in the
   central and southern Yellow Sea during 2000-2011. The final model
   accounted for 28.21% and 41.03% of the variance in anchovy distribution
   and abundance, respectively. The results of a two-step GAM showed that
   hour, longitude, latitude, temperature gradient (TGR), and chlorophyll a
   (Chl-a) concentration best explained the anchovy distribution
   (presence/absence) and that a model including year, longitude, latitude,
   depth, sea surface temperature (SST), and TGR best described anchovy
   abundance (given presence). Longitude and latitude were the most
   important factors affecting both distribution and abundance, but the
   area of high abundance tended to be east and south of the area where
   anchovy were most likely to be present. Hour had a significant effect on
   distribution, but year was more important for anchovy abundance,
   indicating that the anchovy catch ratio varied across the day but
   abundance had an apparent interannual variation. With respect to
   environmental factors, TGR and Chl-a concentration had effects on
   distribution, while depth, SST, and TGR affected abundance. Changes in
   SST between two successive years or between any year and the 2000-2011
   mean were not associated with changes in anchovy distribution or
   abundance. This finding indicated that short- and long-term water
   temperature changes during 2000-2011 were not of sufficient magnitude to
   give rise to variation in wintering anchovy distribution or abundance in
   the study area. The results of this study have important implications
   for fisheries management.

AB Information on the biodiversity of high altitude lakes in the Stelvio
   National Park was scarce and fragmentary, in most cases limited to a few
   studies on a single biological issue. To fill this gap, a
   multidisciplinary research program was established in 2011 to
   investigate macroinvertebrates, diatoms, and water chemistry in 8 high
   altitude lakes within the boundaries of the Park (Rhaetian Alps, Eastern
   Alps). The results of this study were compared with data on biological
   assemblages and chemical parameters of Alpine lakes in the
   Pennine-Lepontine Alps (Western Alps), to evaluate the role of local
   drivers with respect to regional ones. This comparison was possible
   thanks to the adoption of standardized sampling methodologies developed
   since the '90s by the National Research Council-Water Research Institute
   (Verbania), in collaboration with several European Research centers.
   Despite located in a restricted geographical area, the lakes of the
   Stelvio National Park showed a high variability of chemical composition,
   and of sensitivity to acidification, lower than that of the
   Pennine-Lepontine Alpine lakes. Macroinvertebrate and diatom taxa were
   ubiquitous and frequent along the Alps, and mainly represented by
   cold-stenothermal species. Richness, Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou
   indices applied to phyto- and zoobenthos highlighted significantly lower
   values in Stelvio National Park lakes than in those of the
   Pennine-Lepontine Alps for macroinvertebrates, while no significant
   differences were found for diatoms. Two groups of lakes were identified
   by Cluster Analysis, mainly on the basis of major ion concentrations.
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that the macroinvertebrate
   assemblage of the lakes studied is driven mainly by altitude and lake
   surface, and, to a lesser extent, by nutrient content. On the contrary,
   pH and acid-related variables played a secondary role for diatoms, while
   nutrients and, more in general, ionic content had significant effects on
   their species composition. Overall, the results of this first
   investigation showed that the high elevation of these lakes affects
   their macroinvertebrate assemblages, while their diatom communities are
   comparable throughout the Alps.

AB Tree-ring analyses from semi-arid to arid regions in western Himalaya
   show immense potential for developing millennia long climate records.
   Millennium and longer ring-width chronologies of Himalayan pencil
   juniper (Juniperus polycarpos), Himalayan pencil cedar (Cedrus deodara)
   and Chilgoza pine (Pinus gerardiana) have been developed from different
   sites in western Himalaya. Studies conducted so far on various conifer
   species indicate strong precipitation signatures in ring-width
   measurement series. The paucity of weather records from stations close
   to tree-ring sampling sites poses difficulty in calibrating tree-ring
   data against climate data especially precipitation for its strong
   spatial variability in mountain regions. However, for the existence of
   strong coherence in temperature, even in data from distant stations,
   more robust temperature reconstructions representing regional and
   hemispheric signatures have been developed. Tree-ring records from the
   region indicate multi-century warm and cool anomalies consistent with
   the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age anomalies.
   Significant relationships noted between mean premonsoon temperature over
   the western Himalaya and ENSO features endorse utility of climate
   records from western Himalayan region in understanding long-term climate
   variability and attribution of anthropogenic impact.

AB Significant changes in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton
   were observed along Line P in the northeast subarctic Pacific as a
   result of a rapid warming of surface waters in 2014-2015. This feature,
   labeled "the blob," reached similar to 4 degrees C above normal and
   restricted winter ocean-surface nutrient renewal due to increased
   stratification. As a result, surface nutrients were the lowest observed
   and nitrate depletion in summer extended farther offshore than in the
   last three decades. Within this nitrate-depleted region, there was
   unusually low phytoplankton biomass and a dramatic increase in the
   dominance of cyanobacteria, including Prochlorococcus, which had not
   been previously observed in this region. Farther offshore, in the
   iron-limited region, phytoplankton biomass and the abundance of
   haptophytes and chlorophytes increased during "the blob." By 2016,
   surface nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations were still low, but at
   most of the stations, phytoplankton composition was similar to that
   observed before the warming occurred, except for an increase in diatoms
   farther offshore. These changes at the base of the food web could have
   ecosystem-wide implications.

AB Time series of sea-surface temperature (SST), thermally mixed layer
   depth, and the SST warming rate in spring at the time of larval
   emergence were correlated with indices of northern shrimp Pandalus
   borealis recruitment (cohort abundance and larval survival index)
   between 1994 and 2003 in the northwest Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. The
   recruitment index and larval survival index were negatively correlated
   to daily mean SST at the time of larval emergence. The recruitment index
   and larval survival index were positively correlated with the SST
   warming rate and with the mixed layer depth at the time of larval
   emergence. Overall, the analysis reveals that larval emergence during a
   period of weak density stratification and low SST in the spring, but
   followed by relatively high warming rates of the upper layer of the
   water column, is favourable for larval survival. We suggest that the
   observed relationships support the hypothesis that oceanographic
   conditions in the upper layer of the water column, which initiate and
   sustain high levels of biological production at the time of larval
   emergence and early development, are favourable for northern shrimp
   recruitment success. Thus, interannual variability in northern shrimp
   recruitment in the northwest Gulf of St. Lawrence may be explained by
   Cushing's match/mismatch hypothesis.

AB The effects of climate change on the northern limit of the trivoltine
   area were clarified in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury)
   (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). The Takaoka and Kanazawa populations used in
   the present study occur in locations to the north of Fukui (36.07
   degrees N), where H. cunea has recently shifted from a bivoltine to a
   predominantly trivoltine life cycle. The life-history traits of these
   populations were investigated and compared to those in the Fukui
   population. The lower threshold temperature for development and the
   thermal constant for one generation were 11.3 degrees C and 674.5
   degrees d in the Takaoka population, and 11.2 degrees C and 680.7
   degrees d in the Kanazawa population. The critical photoperiod for
   diapause induction at 25 degrees C was 14 h 34 min in the Takaoka
   population and 14 h 28 min in the Kanazawa population. These critical
   photoperiods at 25 degrees C were longer by 24 min and 18 min than the
   Fukui population, respectively. These results, together with climate
   data, suggest that the Takaoka population maintains a bivoltine life
   cycle, and a small part of the Kanazawa population has three generations
   per year, a predominantly bivoltine life cycle. Thus, the present
   northern limit of the trivoltine area lies around Fukui in districts
   along the Japan Sea.

AB Temperature is one of the primary environmental variables limiting
   organismal performance, fitness, and species distributions. Yet,
   understanding temperature effects requires thorough exploration of
   thermal constraints and organismal responses that can translate to
   fitness and non-lethal long-term consequences under both constant and
   changing thermal regimes. We examined the thermal ecology of the fiddler
   crab Uca panacea, including critical thermal limits, thermal sensitivity
   of locomotion, operative environmental temperatures, preferred body
   temperatures, and acclimation ability. Operative environmental
   temperatures frequently reached the critical thermal maximum (41.8 +/-
   0.8 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.), especially in unvegetated
   microhabitats, indicating the need for behavioral thermoregulation to
   maintain diurnal activity patterns. Preferred body temperatures
   (21.1-28.6 degrees C) were substantially below the thermal optimum
   (30-40 degrees C), although further research is needed to determine the
   driver of this mismatch. Critical thermal limits shifted 2-4 degrees C
   in response to exposure to low (20 degrees C) or high (35 degrees C)
   temperatures, with full acclimation occurring in approximately 9 d. This
   capacity for rapid acclimation, combined with the capacity for
   behavioral thermoregulation, is a strong candidate mechanism that
   explains the broad habitat use and could help explain the successful
   pantropical distribution of fiddler crabs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   ranged in length from 24 to 70 mm TL and in age from 41 to 99 days. Mean
   hatching times varied by 7 weeks among years, ranging from June to
   August. Mean annual growth rates ranged from 0.52 to 0.62 mm per day
   among years, and were significantly different (p=0.0018). Hatching
   occurred significantly later when water temperatures were colder,
   indicating that spawning was delayed during years of cold water
   temperatures and extensive ice cover. However, over the 6 years there
   was no general relationship between growth rates and ambient water
   temperatures experienced by larvae and pelagic juveniles. For example,
   lower growth rates in 1994 and 1996 were associated with high ambient
   water temperatures. Length of pelagic juvenile cod on common dates in
   the autumn varied among years, and was primarily a function of age, not
   growth rate. The largest year-class (1994) coincided with the earliest
   spawning, low growth rates, a large size at settlement, and seasonally
   warm water temperatures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas inhabits the intertidal zone and
   shows tolerance to various stress conditions such as hypoxia and heat
   shock. However, little is known about the cellular mechanism of
   responses to these stresses. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)
   regulates the transcription of several genes, including heat shock
   proteins (HSPs). In this study, we cloned HSF1 from the oyster and
   investigated its response to air-exposure. The cDNA of oyster Hsf1
   contains 2,931 bp, of which 1,389 bp encode a protein of 463 amino acid
   residues. Moreover, we found that the oyster has seven novel
   alternatively spliced isoforms, Hsf1b-h, consisting of insertion A with
   48 bp, insertion B with 42 bp and/or insertion C with 42 bp. We
   determined the sequences of oyster genomic DNA containing Hsf1
   insertions A, B and C. The results indicated that eight isoforms of Hsf1
   are generated from a single Hsf1 gene by alternative splicing without
   frameshifting. Real-time PCR analysis showed that Hsf1a is expressed
   constitutively, and the expression of Hsf1b-h and Hsp70 mRNA is induced
   by air exposure and/or hypoxia. In addition, we found that 11 putative
   hypoxia response elements, which are hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)
   binding sequences, are located in the Hsf1 promoter region. These data
   suggest that the oyster has an HIF-HSF pathway in which HSPs are induced
   in an HIF-dependent manner, and that it also has a novel mechanism of
   alternative splicing of Hsf1 in response to hypoxia. J. Exp. Zool.

AB Advancing the field of fish ecology requires a shift in focus from
   describing patterns in species occurrences to understanding the
   mechanisms that regulate distributions and abundances across broad
   scales. For stream fish ecology, this includes understanding
   environmental mechanisms that regulate stream fish demographic
   properties at the scale of stream networks or riverscapes. Despite the
   fact that Banded Sculpin Cottus carolinae occupy a diversity of habitats
   and stream sizes across the southeastern United States, relatively
   little is known about the demography of this species. We assessed annual
   demographic properties (reproduction, growth, and survival) of C.
   carolinae collected monthly from four sites distributed longitudinally
   along the Roaring River riverscape in Tennessee to simultaneously
   describe life history attributes of the species and address
   riverscape-scale variation in population dynamics. Cottus carolinae
   lived for a maximum of four years, local populations were dominated by
   age-0 and age-1 individuals, reproduction began after one year, spawning
   occurred during December and January, and mean ova number was 398. A
   life history tradeoff between growth (robustness) and survival was
   evident at one site where water temperature and flow were least
   variable, otherwise life history attributes were consistent across the
   riverscape despite longitudinal changes in abiotic variables. Our work
   illustrates the potential for muted population responses to a strong
   hydrologic gradient in stream size and highlights the stability inherent
   with fish life history adaptations to natural environmental regimes
   across broad spatial scales.

AB Potential climatic changes of the near future have important
   characteristics that differentiate them from the largest magnitude and
   most rapid of climatic changes of the Quaternary. These potential
   climatic changes are thus a cause for considerable concern in terms of
   their possible impacts upon biodiversity.
   Birds, in common with other terrestrial organisms, are expected to
   exhibit one of two general responses to climatic change: they may adapt
   to the changed conditions without shifting location, or they may show a
   spatial response, adjusting their geographical distribution in response
   to the changing climate. The Quaternary geological record provides
   examples of organisms that responded to the climatic fluctuations of
   that period in each of these ways, but also indicates that the two are
   not alternative responses but components of the same overall
   predominantly spatial response. Species unable to achieve a sufficient
   response by either or both of these mechanisms will be at risk of
   extinction; the Quaternary record documents examples of such
   extinctions.
   Relationships between the geographical distributions of birds and
   present climate have been modelled for species breeding in both Europe
   and Africa. The resulting models have very high goodness-of-fit and
   provide a basis for assessing the potential impacts of anthropogenic
   climatic changes upon avian species richness in the two continents.
   Simulations made for a range of general circulation model projections of
   late 21st century climate lead to the conclusion that the impacts upon
   birds are likely to be substantial. The boundaries of many species'
   potential geographical distributions are likely to be shifted >= 1000
   km. There is likely to be a general decline in avian species richness,
   with the mean extent of species' potential geographical distributions
   likely to decrease. Species with restricted distributions and
   specialized species of particular biomes are likely to suffer the
   greatest impacts. Migrant species are likely to suffer especially large
   impacts as climatic change alters both their breeding and wintering
   areas, as well as critical stopover sites, and also potentially
   increases the distances they must migrate seasonally.
   Without implementation of new conservation measures, these impacts will
   be severe and are likely to be exacerbated by land-use change and
   associated habitat fragmentation. Unless strenuous efforts are made to
   address the root causes of anthropogenic climatic change, much current
   effort to conserve biodiversity will be in vain.

AB Knowledge of relationships between environmental variables and
   biological processes can greatly improve fisheries assessment and
   management in commercially important species. We analyzed the effects of
   environmental factors (climatic indices and water temperature) on the
   stock characteristics (total population number, number of pre-recruits
   and number of legal males) of the red king crab (Paralithodes
   camtschaticus), an introduced species in the Barents Sea. Stock trends
   in red king crab appear to be related to decadal climate shifts.
   Abundances were negatively related to the North Atlantic Oscillation
   index (NAO) in August and positively related to water temperature in
   late wintereearly summer. Total and commercial stock abundance were
   negatively correlated with the lag-1 Arctic Oscillation index (AO) in
   August and the lag-2 winter NAO index. The total number of P.
   camtschaticus was most strongly associated with water temperature in
   spring and summer and NAO/AO indices in April and May. Lagged NAO
   indices in February and August (9 or 10 yr) had a positive relationship
   to the commercial stock of P. camtschaticus. These findings suggest that
   temperature conditions of current and previous year affect natural
   mortality of larvae and juvenile red king crabs. Warmer temperature
   conditions lead to increased biomass of red king crab food items.
   Negative correlations between climatic indices and the red king crab
   stocks may be associated with predator pressure on juvenile red king
   crabs or higher mortality because of predator or parasite pressure and
   diseases. The associations between stock indices and environmental
   variables could help better predict recruitment patterns of P.
   camtschaticus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic improvements in heat tolerance of wheat provide a potential
   adaptation response to long-term warming trends, and may also boost
   yields in wheat-growing areas already subject to heat stress. Yet there
   have been few assessments of recent progress in breeding wheat for hot
   environments. Here, data from 25 years of wheat trials in 76 countries
   from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are
   used to empirically model the response of wheat to environmental
   variation and assess the genetic gains over time in different
   environments and for different breeding strategies. Wheat yields
   exhibited the most sensitivity to warming during the grain-filling
   stage, typically the hottest part of the season. Sites with high vapour
   pressure deficit (VPD) exhibited a less negative response to
   temperatures during this period, probably associated with increased
   transpirational cooling. Genetic improvements were assessed by using the
   empirical model to correct observed yield growth for changes in
   environmental conditions and management over time. These
   'climate-corrected' yield trends showed that most of the genetic gains
   in the high-yield-potential Elite Spring Wheat Yield Trial (ESWYT) were
   made at cooler temperatures, close to the physiological optimum, with no
   evidence for genetic gains at the hottest temperatures. In contrast, the
   Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trial (SAWYT), a lower-yielding nursery targeted
   at maintaining yields under stressed conditions, showed the strongest
   genetic gains at the hottest temperatures. These results imply that
   targeted breeding efforts help us to ensure progress in building heat
   tolerance, and that intensified (and possibly new) approaches are needed
   to improve the yield potential of wheat in hot environments in order to
   maintain global food security in a warmer climate.

AB Data obtained from long-term sediment trap experiments in the Indian
   Ocean in conjunction with satellite observations illustrate the
   influence of primary production and the ballast effect on organic carbon
   flux into the deep sea. They suggest that primary production is the main
   control on the spatial variability of organic carbon fluxes at most of
   our study sites in the Indian Ocean, except at sites influenced by river
   discharges. At these sites the spatial variability of organic carbon
   flux is influenced by lithogenic matter content. To quantify the impact
   of lithogenic matter on the organic carbon flux, the densities of the
   main ballast minerals, their flux rates and seawater properties were
   used to calculate sinking speeds of material intercepted by sediment
   traps. Sinking speeds in combination with satellite-derived export
   production rates allowed us to compute organic carbon fluxes. Flux
   calculations imply that lithogenic matter ballast increases organic
   carbon fluxes at all sampling sites in the Indian Ocean by enhancing
   sinking speeds and reducing the time of organic matter respiration in
   the water column. We calculated that lithogenic matter content in
   aggregates and pellets enhances organic carbon flux rates on average by
   45% and by up to 62% at trap locations in the river-influenced regions
   of the Indian Ocean. Such a strong lithogenic matter ballast effect
   explains the fact that organic carbon fluxes are higher in the
   low-productive southern Java Sea compared to the high-productive western
   Arabian Sea. It also implies that land use changes and the associated
   enhanced transport of lithogenic matter from land into the ocean may
   significantly affect the CO2 uptake of the organic carbon pump in the
   receiving ocean areas.

AB Changes in biomass production and partitioning, together with morphology
   and growth of three white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cultivars after

   study. The cultivars used were Grasslands Huia (H. New Zealand),
   AberHerald (AH. bred in UK from material of Swiss origin) and Sandra (S,
   Sweden), sub-populations of these (survival populations), and a wild
   ecotype from the Uppsala area. The sub-populations Here collected after
   2 (with the exception of S) and 4 years of winter stress, respectively,
   at Uppsala (59 degrees 49' N, 17 degrees 39' E). In the controlled
   environment study the photoperiod was 12 h and there were two
   temperature regimes, namely 23/18 and 12/9 degrees C (day/night),
   respectively. The experimental plants were cloned from eight different
   plants of each population. There were few interactions between
   populations and temperature regimes. Biomass production was lowest in
   the Swedish populations and in the surviving populations of the other
   cultivars collected after 4 years of exposure to winter stress. However,
   biomass partitioning, with the exception of allocation to branches,
   remained unaffected. Morphology differed significantly between
   cultivars, but, with the exception of internode length, was unaffected
   by exposure to winter stress. Internode length, was significantly
   reduced in surviving populations of both H and AH after exposure to four
   winters, when its value was similar to that of the Swedish populations.
   The reduced internode length was a result of a greater reduction in the
   stolen extension rate than in the leaf appearance rate of survival
   populations compared with the original populations. It is hypothesised
   that reduced internode length would hale implications for the carbon
   economy of the plant.

AB Objectives The nasal turbinates directly influence the overall size,
   shape, and surface area of the nasal passages, and thus contribute to
   intranasal heat and moisture exchange. However, unlike the encapsulating
   walls of the nasal cavity, ecogeographic variation in nasal turbinate
   morphology among humans has not yet been established. Here we
   investigate variation in inferior nasal turbinate morphology in two
   populations from climatically extreme environments. Materials and
   methods Twenty-three linear measurements of the inferior turbinate,
   nasal cavity walls, and airway passages were collected from CT scans of
   indigenous modern human crania from Equatorial Africa (n = 35) and the
   Arctic Circle (n = 35). MANOVA and ANCOVA were employed to test for
   predicted regional and sex differences in morphology between the
   samples. Results Significant morphological differences were identified
   between the two regional samples, with no evidence of significant sexual
   dimorphism or region-sex interaction effect. Individuals from the Arctic
   Circle possessed superoinferiorly and mediolaterally larger inferior
   turbinates compared to Equatorial Africans. In conjunction with the
   surrounding nasal cavity walls, these differences in turbinate
   morphology produced airway dimensions that were both consistent with
   functional expectations and more regionally distinct than either
   skeletal component independently. Conclusion This study documents the
   existence of ecogeographic variation in human nasal turbinate morphology
   reflecting climate-mediated evolutionary demands on intranasal heat and
   moisture exchange. Humans adapted to cold-dry environments exhibit
   turbinate morphologies that enhance contact between respired air and
   nasal mucosa to facilitate respiratory air conditioning. Conversely,
   humans adapted to hot-humid environments exhibit turbinate morphologies
   that minimize air-to-mucosa contact, likely to minimize airflow
   resistance and/or facilitate expiratory heat-shedding.

AB Fish stocks vary in abundance. The causes behind the fluctuations may be
   difficult to determine, especially ones caused by natural fluctuations,
   but long-term data series may provide indications of the mechanisms.
   Assessments show that the recruitment to the Norwegian spring-spawning
   herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae) has remained low since 2004, a year
   which produced the last really rich year-class. Long time-series of
   estimated recruitment and mean winter temperature in the ocean showed a
   significant positive correlation for the period 1921-2004. Here, we show
   that this positive correlation did not continue from 2005 onwards as the
   winter temperature increased to high levels while herring recruitment
   decreased and has remained low. The density of zooplankton in the drift
   route of the herring larvae dropped significantly after 2004, and their
   centre of gravity shifted northwards. There may currently be heavy
   predation on the larvae by Atlanic mackerel (Scomber scombrus,
   Scombridae), and top-down regulation is suggested to hamper successful
   recruitment. Our analysis indicates that the presence of food and
   overlap with high food concentrations are likely important regulators of
   survival in herring larvae. The findings may be important for future
   management and planning of fisheries of this stock because recruitment
   failure may continue if temperature remains high and food abundance
   remains low.

AB Assessing the chance of survival of any species is a great challenge in
   conservation biology. In this chapter, we analyse the vulnerability of
   the grey bush cricket Platycleis albopunctata in habitats of different
   food availability under current and increased temperature conditions
   applying an individual-based model. Our simulations show that
   populations in warmer habitats with a higher food limitation have a much
   lower extinction risk than those living in habitats that are less
   food-limited and colder. An increase in mortalities of life stages
   severely increases the risk of population extinction, whereas a shift in
   the termination of egg diapause towards the beginning of the year caused
   by warmer winters has no significant effect on survival. Thus, P
   albopunctata may benefit from increasing future temperatures if neither
   life stage mortalities will increase as the result of simultaneously
   affected abiotic habitat conditions (due to precipitation and
   temperature) and/or species interactions nor changes in abiotic
   conditions will cause a shortage of food. We demonstrate that simulation
   models are a suitable tool to understand processes influencing
   population survival of temperature-dependent species under current and
   future habitat conditions. They are in particular beneficial in
   conserving relict species that are naturally restricted to patchy and
   scarce habitats.

AB AimTo investigate the effect of climatic, historical and spatial
   variables on species richness patterns in freshwater fish.
   LocationNorth America and Europe.
   MethodsRegional species lists were used to document the spatial richness
   patterns. Three realms, Europe and Pacific and Atlantic North America,
   were identified. The numbers of species, by habitat, migration and
   distributional range categories, were calculated and the contributions
   of regional mean and seasonal temperature and rainfall, historical
   (realm, glaciation), and spatial (area, elevational range) variables to
   predicting richness were assessed using boosted regression trees,
   model-averaging and spatially explicit models.
   ResultsThe latitudinal temperature gradient is stronger than that for
   rainfall in the Atlantic realm whereas the rainfall gradient in Europe
   is independent of the temperature gradient. Species richness is more
   strongly correlated with temperature than rainfall, and the effects are
   stronger in the Atlantic realm than in Europe. The influence of
   environmental variables differs between habitat specialist and
   generalist species. Climate, particularly maximum monthly temperature,
   is the best predictor of richness in rivers whereas climate variables
   are less important than historical/spatial variables for diadromous
   species.
   Main conclusionsFreshwater fish richness differences between realms
   follow differences in spatial climatic trends. The contributions of
   climatic, historical and spatial predictor variables vary with ecology:
   temperature is a better predictor than rainfall in river-dwellers. The
   richness gradient is driven more by physiological than by energetic
   constraints on species. The importance of history is probably
   underestimated because of correlations with climate variables.

   used for species with longevity greater than an annual life cycle. The
   GUM was solved for the Pacific sardine (Sardinops caerulus) from the
   Gulf of California, Mexico. New features added to the original GUM were
   (a) the use of estimates of the mean annual fecundity, (b) the ability
   to incorporate observed data for specific interval of durations for
   developmental stages to calibrate calculations of M vectors. and (c)
   uncertainty because of fecundity variation. When this approach was used
   for the Pacific sardine. we did not find statistical differences (P >
   0.05) between the GUM estimates and independent estimates based on the
   literature. The GIM showed that it provides reasonable estimations for
   the duration of life history stages. Variability in egg-stage duration
   was also explored for M vectors. We observed daily survival increases a

AB Certain primitive plants undergo orchestrated temperature control during
   flowering. Skunk cabbage, Symplocarpus foetidus, has been demonstrated
   to maintain an internal temperature of around 20 degrees C even when the
   ambient temperature drops below freezing. However, it is not clear
   whether a unique algorithm controls the homeothermic behavior of S.
   foetidus, or whether such an algorithm might exhibit linear or nonlinear
   thermoregulatory dynamics. Here we report the underlying dynamics of
   temperature control in S. foetidus using nonlinear forecasting,
   attractor and correlation dimension analyses. It was shown that
   thermoregulation in S. foetidus was governed by low-dimensional chaotic
   dynamics, the geometry of which showed a strange attractor named the
   "Zazen attractor." Our data suggest that the chaotic thermoregulation in
   S. foetidus is inherent and that it is an adaptive response to the
   natural environment.

   the whole lake ecosystem. In this study, thermocline depths in large
   mesocosms installed in Lake Stechlin (Germany) were deepened by 2 meters
   and phytoplankton changes were analysed by comparing changes to
   untreated mesocosms. Higher amounts of SRP were registered in the
   hypolimnion of treatment mesocosms than in the controls, and there were
   no differences in the epilimnion. Small but significant changes were
   observed on the phytoplankton community composition related to the
   effect of deepening the thermocline; however, it was weaker than the
   yearly successional changes. The most remarkable differences were caused
   by Planktothrix rubescens and by chlorophytes. P. rubescens became
   strongly dominant at the end of the experiment in the mesocosms, and in
   the open lake as well. The results of the experiment cannot clearly
   support the proliferation of cyanobacteria in general; however, the
   deepened thermocline can modify the behaviour of some species, as was
   observed in case of P. rubescens.

AB The amount of solar radiation absorbed by an organism is a function of
   the intensity of the radiation and the area of the organism exposed to
   the source of the radiation. Since the prosobranch gastropod
   Echinolittorina peruviana is longer than it is wide, its areas of the
   lateral sides are approximately twice as large a's the. areas of the
   frontal and dorsal faces. We quantified the orientation of the
   intertidal prosobranch E peruviana with respect to the position of the
   sun and solar heat gain in the different orientations. In the field,
   80.9% of the E. peruviana monitored on sunny summer days tended to face
   the sun frontally or dorsally while only 19.1% faced the sun with the
   larger lateral sides. On overcast sum mer or on winter days, this trend
   Was not observed. We then show that the body temperature of individuals
   increases more rapidly and reaches higher equilibriums when the lateral
   sides are facing the sun than when they face the sun with either of the
   smaller frontal or dorsal sides. These results therefore show that the
   orientation behavior of E. peruviana is thermoregulatory and that it
   permits the organisms to maintain lower temperatures on hot summer days.

AB Uncovering the quantitative laws that govern the growth and division of
   single cells remains a major challenge. Using a unique combination of
   technologies that yields unprecedented statistical precision, we find
   that the sizes of individual Caulobacter crescentus cells increase
   exponentially in time. We also establish that they divide upon reaching
   a critical multiple (approximate to 1.8) of their initial sizes, rather
   than an absolute size. We show that when the temperature is varied, the
   growth and division timescales scale proportionally with each other over
   the physiological temperature range. Strikingly, the cell-size and
   division-time distributions can both be rescaled by their mean values
   such that the condition-specific distributions collapse to universal
   curves. We account for these observations with a minimal stochastic
   model that is based on an autocatalytic cycle. It predicts the scalings,
   as well as specific functional forms for the universal curves. Our
   experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a simple physical
   principle governing these complex biological processes: a single
   temperature-dependent scale of cellular time governs the stochastic
   dynamics of growth and division in balanced growth conditions.

AB Ongoing climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. However,
   although many species clearly suffer from ongoing climate change, others
   benefit from it, for example, by showing range expansions. However,
   which specific features determine a species' vulnerability to climate
   change? Phenotypic plasticity, which has been described as the first
   line of defence against environmental change, may be of utmost
   importance here. Against this background, we here compare plasticity in
   stress tolerance in 3 copper butterfly species, which differ arguably in
   their vulnerability to climate change. Specifically, we investigated
   heat, cold and desiccation resistance after acclimatization to different
   temperatures in the adult stage. We demonstrate that acclimation at a
   higher temperature increased heat but decreased cold tolerance and
   desiccation resistance. Contrary to our predictions, species did not
   show pronounced variation in stress resistance, though plastic
   capacities in temperature stress resistance did vary across species.
   Overall, our results seemed to reflect populationrather than
   species-specific patterns. We conclude that the geographical origin of
   the populations used should be considered even in comparative studies.
   However, our results suggest that, in the 3 species studied here,
   vulnerability to climate change is not in the first place determined by
   stress resistance in the adult stage. As entomological studies focus all
   too often on adults only, we argue that more research effort should be
   dedicated to other developmental stages when trying to understand insect
   responses to environmental change.

AB The climate of the North Atlantic region exhibits fluctuations on
   decadal timescales that have large societal consequences. Prominent
   examples include hurricane activity in the Atlantic(1), and surface-
   temperature and rainfall variations over North America(2), Europe(3) and
   northern Africa(4). Although these multidecadal variations are
   potentially predictable if the current state of the ocean is known(5-7),
   the lack of subsurface ocean observations(8) that constrain this state
   has been a limiting factor for realizing the full skill potential of
   such predictions(9). Here we apply a simple approach - that uses only
   sea surface temperature ( SST) observations - to partly overcome this
   difficulty and perform retrospective decadal predictions with a climate
   model. Skill is improved significantly relative to predictions made with
   incomplete knowledge of the ocean state(10), particularly in the North
   Atlantic and tropical Pacific oceans. Thus these results point towards
   the possibility of routine decadal climate predictions. Using this
   method, and by considering both internal natural climate variations and
   projected future anthropogenic forcing, we make the following forecast:
   over the next decade, the current Atlantic meridional overturning
   circulation will weaken to its long- term mean; moreover, North Atlantic
   SST and European and North American surface temperatures will cool
   slightly, whereas tropical Pacific SST will remain almost unchanged. Our
   results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over
   the next decade, as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and
   tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming.

AB We studied Polylepis forests along an elevational transect between 3,650
   and 4,050 m a.s.l. at the treeline of the moist eastern cordillera in
   Bolivia to examine changes in above- and below-ground stand structure,
   leaf and root morphology, and regeneration in relation to stand
   microclimate. Field measurements and model predictions indicated
   relatively cold growth conditions of the Polylepis forests. Tree height,
   stem diameter, and basal area of the stands decreased markedly while
   stem density increased with elevation. Leaf morphology differed between
   the two occurring Polylepis species, and trees at the treeline had
   smaller leaves with higher specific leaf area. In contrast, fine root
   biomass increased from 37 g m(-2) at the lowermost stand to 234 g m(-2)
   at the treeline. Trees of the uppermost stand had higher specific root
   surface area and a much higher number of root tips per unit dry mass.
   Thus, root surface area and total number of root tips per unit ground
   area increased conspicuously from the lowermost stand to the treeline.
   Density of young growth inside the forest increased towards the
   treeline, while density in the open grassland decreased with elevation.
   Young growth originated from sexual reproduction at the lower forest but
   was comprised exclusively of root suckers at the treeline stand. We
   conclude that both the marked change in carbon allocation towards the
   root system, as well as the changes in root morphology with elevation
   indicate an adaptation to reduced nutrient supply under cold conditions
   of these Polylepis stands at the treeline in E Bolivia.

AB Eddy covariance measurements were begun in late April 2004 to quantify
   CO2 exchange in a perennial C-3/C-4 grassland on the Edwards Plateau
   near San Marcos, TX. Objectives were to document how net ecosystem
   exchange of CO2 (NEE) and its components, gross photosynthesis (GPP) and
   ecosystem respiration (R-e), vary on a seasonal and interannual basis,
   and to examine how environmental factors affect C exchange. Described
   here are the first 32 months of measurements. The grassland was
   intermittently grazed in 2004 and 2005, and heavily grazed during the
   spring and summer of 2006. Total rainfall from May through December 2004
   was 1378 mm, well above the 858 mm annual mean, whereas rainfall in 2005
   and 2006 was near normal. The grassland was dominated by C-4 grasses
   when measurements began, but C-3 grasses and forbs became dominant as
   the study progressed. The shift from a C-4- to a C-3-dominated ecosystem
   was accompanied by a 24% decline in light use efficiency. Water deficits
   were a frequent occurrence, even during 2004 when rainfall was high,
   causing large reductions in R-e, GPP, and light use efficiency, and
   temporary shifts in the grassland from C sink to C source. Our
   measurements showed the grassland was a small C sink over the 32 months,
   gaining 170 g m(-2) of C, due in large part to drought-induced
   suppression of Re during the winter of 2005-2006, and to a pulse of
   growth that occurred during the last 3 months of 2006. Total GPP and R-e
   were 2081 and 1911 g m(-2), respectively. The grassland accumulated 1037
   g m(-2) of C during the daytime, and lost 867 g m(-2) at night. Rates of
   C uptake were highest in the spring, and were higher when grazing was
   heaviest because growth of new leaves having a high photosynthetic
   efficiency, and reductions in R-e, compensated for loss of leaf area.

AB The impact of climate change may be felt most keenly by tropical
   ectotherms. In these taxa, it is argued, thermal specialization means a
   given shift in temperature will have a larger effect on fitness. For
   species with limited dispersal ability, the impact of climate change
   depends on the capacity for their climate-relevant traits to shift. Such
   shifts can occur through genetic adaptation, various forms of
   plasticity, or a combination of these processes. Here we assess the
   extent and causes of shifts in 7 physiological traits in a tropical
   lizard, the rainforest sunskink (Lampropholis coggeri). Two populations
   were sampled that differ from each other in both climate and
   physiological traits. We compared trait values in each animal soon after
   field collection versus following acclimation to laboratory conditions.
   We also compared trait values between populations in: (i) recently
   field-collected animals; (ii) the same animals following laboratory
   acclimation; and (iii) the laboratory-reared offspring of these animals.
   Our results reveal high trait lability, driven primarily by acclimation
   and local adaptation. By contrast, developmental plasticity, resulting
   from incubation temperature, had little to no effect on most traits.
   These results suggest that, while specialized, tropical ectotherms may
   be capable of rapid shifts in climate-relevant traits.

AB Identifying how close species live to their physiological thermal maxima
   is essential to understand historical warm-edge elevational limits of
   montane faunas and forecast upslope shifts caused by future climate
   change. We used laboratory experiments to quantify the thermal tolerance
   and acclimation potential of four fishes (Notropis leuciodus, N.
   rubricroceus, Etheostoma rufilineatum, E. chlorobranchium) that are
   endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA), exhibit different
   historical elevational limits, and represent the two most species-rich
   families in the region. All-subsets selection of linear regression
   models using AIC(c) indicated that species, acclimation temperature,
   collection location and month, and the interaction between species and
   acclimation temperature were important predictors of thermal maxima
   (T-max), which ranged from 28.5 to 37.2 degrees C. Next, we implemented
   water temperature models and stochastic weather generation to
   characterize the magnitude and frequency of extreme heat events
   (T-extreme) under historical and future climate scenarios across 25 379
   stream reaches in the upper Tennessee River system. Lastly, we used
   environmental niche models to compare warming tolerances
   (acclimation-corrected T-max minus T-extreme) between historically
   occupied versus unoccupied reaches. Historical warming tolerances,
   ranging from +2.2 to +10.9 degrees C, increased from low to high
   elevation and were positive for all species, suggesting that T-max does
   not drive warm-edge (low elevation) range limits. Future warming
   tolerances were lower (-1.2 to +9.3 degrees C) but remained positive for
   all species under the direst warming scenario except for a small
   proportion of reaches historically occupied by E. rufilineatum,
   indicating that T-max and acclimation potentials of southern Appalachian
   minnows and darters are adequate to survive future heat waves. We
   caution concluding that these species are invulnerable to 21st century
   warming because sublethal thermal physiology remains poorly understood.
   Integrating physiological sensitivity and warming exposure demonstrates
   a general and fine-grained approach to assess climate change
   vulnerability for freshwater organisms across physiographically diverse
   riverscapes.

AB Populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar at the edge of the species'
   distribution are the most vulnerable to environmental changes. Those
   inhabiting southern European rivers are expected to be particularly
   affected by global warming. However, they are exploited as a very
   valuable resource for the region, attracting tourism and generating
   substantial income. In the central part of northern Spain (Asturias),
   there is a long tradition of sport fisheries (angling). The first salmon
   caught in a river each year is called the "campanu." Analysis of a
   50-year time series demonstrates that the run timing of the Asturian
   Atlantic salmon has changed over this period, as inferred from
   significant delays in the date of capture of the campanu. Average
   campanu weight has experienced a parallel significant decrease but age
   has not changed, indicating diminution of salmon condition. These
   changes are statistically associated with an increase in regional
   temperature, there being a minor effect of the global climate North
   Atlantic Oscillation index. Negative effects of high temperatures on
   salmon run and feeding, together with long migratory routes, may explain
   these results.

AB Lake level fluctuations and environmental changes during the late
   Holocene were inferred from changes in sedimentology, bulk and isotope
   organic geochemistry, and a diatom based transfer function in a sediment
   core from Boqueirao Lake, northeast Brazil. The age-depth model was
   established using fifteen AMS C-14 dates. Lake water level began
   increasing about AD 400, and reached its maximum during the Medieval
   Climate Anomaly (MCA), AD similar to 900-1100. Low lake water level was
   recorded during the Little Ice Age (LIA), AD similar to 1400-1820, which
   allowed macrophyte development in the littoral zone that was recorded by
   high C-org/N-total ratios. Considerable lake level variability was
   evident during the Current Warm Period (CWP). Humid/dry conditions in
   northeast Brazil during MCA/LIA, respectively, are related to the
   southward shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during austral
   summer and fall. Those conditions contrast with records of a
   decrease/increase in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) during
   these periods. This observation also contrasts with paleoclimate
   inferences from the circum-Caribbean region indicating a northward shift
   of the ITCZ northern hemisphere summer position during the MCA and a
   southward shift during the LIA. We suggest that these shifts in ITCZ
   seasonality were higher during the MCA and smaller during the LIA. Our
   aim was to answer whether the zonal atmospheric circulation cell between
   the Amazon and northeast Brazil was responsible for antiphasing with the
   SASM. A strong monsoon over South America during the LIA reinforced
   convection upon Amazon, increasing the northeast low in the upper
   troposphere and large-scale subsidence over northeast Brazil and the
   Atlantic Ocean leading to a northward repositioning of the South
   Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone. These factors in combination may have
   limited the southward seasonal shift of ITCZ, and they must have been

AB If an increase in temperature will limit the growth of a species, it
   will be in the warmest portion of the species distribution. Therefore,
   in this study we examined the effects of elevated temperature on net
   carbon assimilation and biomass production of northern red oak (Quercus
   rubra L.) seedlings grown near the southern limit of the species
   distribution. Seedlings were grown in chambers in elevated CO2 (700 mu
   mol mol(-1)) at three temperature conditions, ambient (tracking diurnal
   and seasonal variation in outdoor temperature), ambient +3 degrees C and
   ambient +6 degrees C, which produced mean growing season temperatures of
   23, 26 and 29 degrees C, respectively. A group of seedlings was also
   grown in ambient [CO2] and ambient temperature as a check of the growth
   response to elevated [CO2]. Net photosynthesis and leaf respiration,
   photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax, J(max) and triose phosphate utilization
   (TPU)) and chlorophyll fluorescence, as well as seedling height,
   diameter and biomass, were measured during one growing season. Higher
   growth temperatures reduced net photosynthesis, increased respiration
   and reduced height, diameter and biomass production. Maximum net
   photosynthesis at saturating [CO2] and maximum rate of electron
   transport (J(max)) were lowest throughout the growing season in
   seedlings grown in the highest temperature regime. These parameters were
   also lower in June, but not in July or September, in seedlings grown at
   +3 degrees C above ambient, compared with those grown in ambient
   temperature, indicating no impairment of photosynthetic capacity with a
   moderate increase in air temperature. An unusual and potentially
   important observation was that foliar respiration did not acclimate to
   growth temperature, resulting in substantially higher leaf respiration
   at the higher growth temperatures. Lower net carbon assimilation was
   correlated with lower growth at higher temperatures. Total biomass at
   the end of the growing season decreased in direct proportion to the
   increase in growth temperature, declining by 6% per 1 degrees C increase
   in mean growing season temperature. Our observations suggest that
   increases in air temperature above current ambient conditions will be
   detrimental to Q. rubra seedlings growing near the southern limit of the
   species range.

AB Intra-individual variation in the production and size of reproductive
   traits has been documented in columnar cacti, being higher in
   equator-facing flowers. Such variation is attributed to the high amount
   of PAR intercepted by stems oriented towards the equator. Most studies
   focused on this phenomenon have documented the existence of
   intra-individual variation on traits associated with the female
   function; however, its impact on traits associated with the male
   function has been neglected. We tested the hypothesis that
   equator-facing flowers of Myrtillocactus geometrizans exhibit higher
   values on traits associated with both male and female functions than
   flowers facing against it. Number and size of anthers and ovaries,
   pollen:ovule ratio and number and quality of pollen grains (diameter,
   germinability, viability and pollen tube length) were estimated from
   reproductive structures facing north and south, and compared with
   t-tests between orientations. Number of anthers per flower, number of
   pollen grains per anther and per floral bud; pollen size, viability and
   germinability; pollen tube length; ovary length and pollen:ovule ratio
   were significantly higher in reproductive structures oriented towards
   the south (i.e. equator). These findings suggest that intra-individual
   variation in floral traits of M.geometrizans might be associated with
   different availability of resources in branches with contrasting
   orientation. Our results provide new evidence of the existence of a
   response to an orientation-dependent extrinsic gradient. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study documenting the existence of
   intra-individual variation on pollen quality and P:O ratio in Cactaceae
   species.

AB Different morbidities and mortalities of ischemic stroke may occur among
   seasons. For detecting the seasonal variations of severity after stroke
   onset and prognosis, we employed a retrospective analysis on a
   prospective regional hospital-based stroke registry and included a total
   of 1039 consecutive patients with onset date from January 2014 to
   December 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the
   onset seasons. Baseline characteristics, stroke subtypes, admission
   National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and modified
   Rankin Scale (mRS) score in 90 d were recorded and compared. Ordinal
   logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of seasons and
   severity or outcomes. Higher proportion of cardiac embolisms appeared in
   spring and winter (p < 0.001). The median admission NIHSS score was 5 in
   spring, 3 in summer, 4 in fall and 4 in winter (p = 0.036). After 90 d
   from onset, 40.5% of patients in spring suffered poor outcome (mRS 3-6),
   while 24.6% in summer, 33.9% in fall and 40.1% in winter (p < 0.001).
   After adjusted for age, sex, stroke subtypes and other covariates,
   patients in spring and winter had 1.76 times (95%CI 1.14-2.70, p =
   0.010) and 1.53 times (95%CI 1.08-2.18, p = 0.017) the risk of suffering
   higher severity category than patients in summer, respectively. Compared
   with summer group, risk of worse outcomes at 90 d increased to 2.30
   times in spring (95%CI 153-3.45, p < 0.001), 157 times in fall (95%CI
   1.14-2.16, p = 0.006) and 2.09 times in winter (95%CI 1.50-2.91, p <
   0.001), respectively. In conclusion, onset seasons were associated with
   severity and outcomes in ischemic stroke, and patients admitted in
   spring and winter had more severity and worse outcomes than patients in
   summer.

AB Planktivorous capelin is a key species in the Barents Sea, being of
   great importance in the exploitation of plankton production in this
   subarctic region. However, in years with a successful reproduction of
   the Norwegian spring-spawning herring, large amounts of herring larvae
   drift into the Barents Sea, where they stay for 2 to 3 yr. The 1 to 2 yr
   old herring has a pronounced impact on capelin, eating large amounts of
   capelin larvae. The main fish predator of the Barents Sea, the
   Arcto-Norwegian cod, also consumes large amounts of post-larval capelin.
   In this study, we show how temperature and the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) indirectly influence the population dynamics of
   capelin by influencing the reproduction of herring and cod. After 1980,
   when the herring spawning stock had recovered after its collapse in
   1969, we found that temperature strongly negatively influences capelin
   cohorts 2 yr before spawning. Capelin cohorts which have spawned 2 yr
   after a warm year tend to experience high predation from both young
   herring as larvae and from 3 to 6 yr old cod during the rest of their
   life. Other analyses confirm that present sea temperatures or previous
   NAO conditions have strong positive effects on the abundance of 0-group
   cod and herring. Thus, the climatic regime of the region ultimately
   determines the balance between capelin and herring, which in turn has
   pronounced consequences for the species composition and energy flow of
   the entire ecosystem.

AB Simultaneous fluorescence and photoacoustic measurements have been used
   to study the effects of metal ions (copper, lead, and mercury) during
   dark incubation of thylakoid membranes. The values of the chlorophyll
   fluorescence parameters Fo (initial fluorescence yield with the reaction
   centers in the open state), Fm (maximal fluorescence yield), Ft (steady
   state fluorescence yield) and the calculated parameters, Phi(o) (maximal
   quantum yield of Photosystem II photochemistry) and Phi(t) (actual
   quantum yield of Photosystem II photochemistry), strongly decreased in
   the presence of the metal ions coinciding with an increase in the
   non-photochemical deexcitation rate constant k(N). It was observed that
   photosynthetic energy storage measured by photoacoustic spectroscopy
   also decreased but a large portion of energy storage remained unaffected
   even at the highest metal ion concentrations used. A maximal inhibition
   of photosynthetic energy storage of 80% and 50% was obtained with Hg2+
   and Cu2+ treated thylakoids, respectively, while energy storage was
   insensitive to Pb2+. The results are consistent with the known
   predominant inhibition of the donor side of Photosystem II by the metal
   ions. The insensitive portion of energy storage is attributed to the
   possible recurrence, of cyclic electron transport around Photosystem II
   that would depend on the extent of inhibition produced on the acceptor
   side by the metal ion used.

AB Varved minerogenic sediments from glacial-fed Blue Lake, northern
   Alaska, are used to investigate late Holocene climate variability.
   Varve-thickness measurements track summer temperature recorded at Atigun
   Pass, located 41 km east at a similar elevation (r (2) = 0.31, P =
   0.08). Results indicate that climate in the Brooks Range from 10 to 730
   AD (varve year) was warm with precipitation inferred to be higher than
   during the twentieth century. The varve-temperature relationship for
   this period was likely compromised and not used in our temperature
   reconstruction because the glacier was greatly reduced, or absent,
   exposing sub-glacial sediments to erosion from enhanced precipitation.
   Varve-inferred summer temperatures and precipitation decreased after 730
   AD, averaging 0.4A degrees C above the last millennial average (LMA =
   4.2A degrees C) from 730 to 850 AD, and 0.1A degrees C above the LMA
   from 850 to 980 AD. Cooling culminated between 980 and 1030 AD with
   temperatures 0.7A degrees C below the LMA. Varve-inferred summer
   temperatures increased between 1030 and 1620 AD to the LMA, though the
   period between 1260 and 1350 AD was 0.2A degrees C below the LMA.
   Although there is no equivalent to the European Medieval Warm Period in
   the Blue Lake record, two warm intervals occurred from 1350 to 1450 AD
   and 1500 to 1620 AD (0.4 and 0.3A degrees C above the LMA,
   respectively). During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1620 to 1880 AD),
   inferred summer temperature averaged 0.2A degrees C below the LMA. After
   1880 AD, inferred summer temperature increased to 0.8A degrees C above
   the LMA, glaciers retreated, but aridity persisted based on a number of
   regional paleoclimate records. Despite warming and glacial retreat,
   varve thicknesses have not achieved pre-730 AD levels. This reflects
   limited sediment availability and transport due to a less extensive
   retreat compared to the first millennium, and continued relative
   aridity. Overall, the Blue Lake record is similar to varve records from
   the eastern Canadian Arctic that document a cool LIA and twentieth
   century warming. However, the occurrence and timing of events, such as
   the LIA and Medieval Warm Period, varies considerably among records,
   suggesting heterogeneous climatic patterns across the North American
   Arctic.

AB Successive disease outbreaks in oyster (Crassostrea gigas) beds in
   France have resulted in dramatic losses in production, and subsequent
   decline in the oyster-farming industry. Deaths of juvenile oysters have
   been associated with the presence of a herpes virus (OsHV-1 mu var) and
   bacterial populations of the genus Vibrio. Although the pathogenicity of
   OsHV-1 mu var, as well as several strains of Vibrio has been
   demonstrated by experimental infections, our understanding of the
   complexity of infections occurring in the natural environment remains
   limited. In the present study, we use specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
   oysters infected in an estuarine environment to study the diversity and
   dynamics of cultured microbial populations during disease expression. We
   observe that rapid Vibrio colonization followed by viral replication
   precedes oyster death. No correlation was found between the vibrio
   concentration and viral load in co-infected animals. We show that the
   quantity of viral DNA is a predictor of mortality, however, in the
   absence of bacteria, a high load of herpes virus is not sufficient to
   induce the full expression of the disease. In addition, we demonstrate
   that juvenile mortalities can occur in the absence of herpes virus,
   indicating that the herpes virus appears neither essential nor
   sufficient to cause juvenile deaths; whereas bacteria are necessary for
   the disease. Finally, we demonstrate that oysters are a reservoir of
   putative pathogens, and that the geographic origin, age, and cultivation
   method of oysters influence disease expression.

AB Marginal reef sites are typically characterized by a low diversity of
   coral species; however, they are considered high conservation
   priorities. Despite their importance, the ecology of edge populations is
   poorly known. Arraial do Cabo, which is located within an upwelling
   region, represents the southernmost limit of the reef coral Siderastrea
   stellata Verrill, 1868, a species endemic to Brazil. The present study
   characterizes the population structure of S. stellata in Arraial do Cabo
   in terms of colony size, density, and percentage cover, in relation to
   the density of other coral species and seawater temperature. When
   compared to previous studies on S. stellata, populations within the
   species geographical range, a decrease in the abundance and colony size
   was expected to be observed in this edge population. However, S.
   stellata thrives in Arraial do Cabo and population parameters did not
   seem to decrease toward the species southern range limit. Siderastrea
   stellata may have found an ecological niche in a marginal area that is
   not available with the species range, allowing this population to expand
   in colony size and number. Siderastrea stellata was the most abundant
   species within the coral community and appears to be resilient to low
   temperatures. Recruits and small-sized adults of S. stellata were well
   represented at all sampling sites, but large-size colonies were more
   frequent in restricted-access areas. Given its unique environmental
   features, Arraial do Cabo should be regarded as a hotspot for coral
   conservation and research in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.

AB Temperature's pervasive effects on physiological systems are reflected
   in the suite of temperature-adaptive differences observed among species
   from different thermal niches, such as species with different vertical
   distributions (zonations) along the subtidal to intertidal gradient.
   Among the physiological traits that exhibit adaptive variation related
   to vertical zonation are whole organism thermal tolerance, heart
   function, mitochondrial respiration, membrane static order (fluidity),
   action potential generation, protein synthesis, heat-shock protein
   expression, and protein thermal stability. For sonic. but not all, of
   these thermally sensitive traits acclimatization leads to adaptive
   shifts in thermal optima and limits. The costs associated with repairing
   thermal damage and adapting systems through acclimatization may
   contribute importantly to energy budgets. These costs arise from such
   sources as: (i) activation and operation of the heat-shock response,
   (ii) replacement of denatured proteins that have been removed through
   proteolysis, (iii) restructuring of cellular membranes ("homeoviscous"
   adaptation), and (iv) pervasive shifts in gene expression (as gauged by
   using DNA microarray techniques). The vertical zonation observed in
   rocky inter-tidal habitats thus may reflect two distinct yet closely
   related aspects of thermal physiology: (i) intrinsic interspecific
   differences in temperature sensitivities of physiological systems, which
   establish thermal optima and tolerance limits for species; and (ii)
   'cost of living' considerations arising from sub-lethal perturbation of
   these physiological systems, which may establish an energetics-based
   limitation to the maximal height at which a species can occur.
   Quantifying the energetic costs arising from heat stress represents an
   important challenge for future investigations.

AB The deposition of surface (farinose) flavonoids on aerial parts of some
   Primula species is a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon.
   Here, we show that flavonoid deposition on the leaves and winter buds
   may contribute strongly to preventing freezing damage in these plants.
   The ice nucleation temperature of fairy primrose (Primula malacoides)
   leaves covered with natural flavone was approximately 6 degrees C lower
   compared to those that had their flavone artificially removed.
   Additionally, farinose flavonoids on the leaves reduced subsequent
   electrolyte leakage (EL) from the cells exposed to freezing
   temperatures. Interestingly, exogenous application of flavone at 4mg/g
   fresh weight to P. malacoides leaves, which had the original flavone
   mechanically removed, restored freezing tolerance, and diminished EL
   from the cells to pretreatment values. Our results suggest that farinose
   flavonoids may function as mediators of freezing tolerance in P.
   malacoides, and exogenous application of flavone could be used to reduce
   freezing damage during sudden but predictable frost events in other
   plant species.

AB Aim We explore geographic variation in body size within the wingless
   grasshopper, Phaulacridium vittatum, along a latitudinal gradient, and
   ask whether melanism can help explain the existence of clinal variation.
   We test the hypotheses that both male and female grasshoppers will be
   larger and lighter in colour at lower latitudes, and that reflectance
   and size will be positively correlated, as predicted by biophysical
   theory. We then test the hypothesis that variability in size and
   reflectance is thermally driven, by assessing correlations with
   temperature and other climatic variables. Location Sixty-one populations
   were sampled along the east coast of Australia between latitudes 27.63
   degrees S and 43.10 degrees S, at elevations ranging from 10 to 2000 m
   a.s.l. Methods Average reflectance was used as a measure of melanism and
   femur length as an index of body size for 198 adult grasshoppers.
   Climate variables were generated by BIOCLIM for each collection
   locality. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify those variables
   with the most independent influence on grasshopper size and reflectance.
   Results Overall, there was no simple relationship between size and
   latitude in P. vittatum. Female body size decreased significantly with
   latitude, while male body size was largest at intermediate latitudes.
   Rainfall was the most important climatic variable associated with body
   size of both males and females. Female body size was also associated
   with radiation seasonality and male body size with reflectance. The
   reflectance of females was not correlated with latitude or body size,
   while male reflectance was significantly higher at intermediate
   latitudes and positively correlated with body size. Analyses of climate
   variables showed no significant association with male reflectance, while
   female reflectance was significantly related to the mean temperature of
   the driest quarter. Main conclusions Geographic variation in the body
   size of the wingless grasshopper is best explained in terms of rainfall
   and radiation seasonality, rather than temperature. However, melanism is
   also a significant influence on body size in male grasshoppers,
   suggesting that thermal fitness does play a role in determining adaptive
   responses to local conditions in this sex.

AB Buckling and postbuckling analysis is presented for axially compressed
   microtubules (MTs) embedded in an elastic matrix of cytoplasm. The
   microtubule is modeled as a nonlocal shear deformable cylindrical shell
   which contains small scale effects. The surrounding elastic medium is
   modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The governing equations are based on
   higher order shear deformation shell theory with a von
   Karman-Donnell-type of kinematic nonlinearity and include the
   extension-twist and flexural-twist couplings. The thermal effects are
   also included and the material properties are assumed to be
   temperature-dependent. The small scale parameter e (0) a is estimated by
   matching the buckling load from their vibrational behavior of MTs with
   the numerical results obtained from the nonlocal shear deformable shell
   model. The numerical results show that buckling load and postbuckling
   behavior of MTs are very sensitive to the small scale parameter e (0) a.
   The results reveal that the MTs under axial compressive loading
   condition have an unstable postbuckling path, and the lateral constraint
   has a significant effect on the postbuckling response of a microtubule
   when the foundation stiffness is sufficiently large.

AB Sediments in Lower Murray Lake, northern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut
   Canada (81A degrees 21'A N, 69A degrees 32'A W) contain annual
   laminations (varves) that provide a record of sediment accumulation
   through the past 5000+ years. Annual mass accumulation was estimated
   based on measurements of varve thickness and sediment bulk density.
   Comparison of Lower Murray Lake mass accumulation with instrumental
   climate data, long-term records of climatic forcing mechanisms and other
   regional paleoclimate records suggests that lake sedimentation is
   positively correlated with regional melt season temperatures driven by
   radiative forcing. The temperature reconstruction suggests that recent
   temperatures are similar to 2.6A degrees C higher than minimum
   temperatures observed during the Little Ice Age, maximum temperatures
   during the past 5200 years exceeded modern values by similar to 0.6A
   degrees C, and that minimum temperatures observed approximately 2900
   varve years BC were similar to 3.5A degrees C colder than recent
   conditions. Recent temperatures were the warmest since the fourteenth
   century, but similar conditions existed intermittently during the period
   spanning similar to 4000-1000 varve years ago. A highly stable pattern
   of sedimentation throughout the period of record supports the use of
   annual mass accumulation in Lower Murray Lake as a reliable proxy
   indicator of local climatic conditions in the past.

AB Circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in the
   environment to enhance overall fitness. Transcription factors (TFs) play
   a prominent role in the molecular mechanism but are incompletely
   described possibly due to functional redundancy, gene family
   proliferation, and/or lack of context-specific assays. To overcome
   these, we performed a high-throughput yeast one-hybrid screen using the
   LUX ARRYHTHMO (LUX) gene promoter as bait against an Arabidopsis TF
   library. LUX is a unique gene because its mutation causes severe clock
   defects and transcript maintains high-amplitude cycling in the cold. We
   report the well-characterized cold-inducible C-repeat
   (CRT)/drought-responsive element (DRE) binding factor CBF1/DREB1b is a
   transcriptional regulator of LUX. We show that CBF1 binds the CRT in the
   LUX promoter, and both genes overlap in temporal and spatial expression.
   CBF1 overexpression causes upregulation of LUX and also alters other
   clock gene transcripts. LUX promoter regions including the CRT and
   Evening Element (EE) are sufficient for high-amplitude transcriptional
   cycling in the cold, and cold-acclimated lux seedlings are sensitive to
   freezing stress. Our data show cold signaling is integrated into the
   clock by CBF-mediated regulation of LUX expression, thereby defining a
   new transcriptional mechanism for temperature input to the circadian
   clock.

AB Ectothermic species are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature
   and may adapt to changes in thermal environments through evolutionary
   shifts in thermal physiology or thermoregulatory behaviour.
   Nevertheless, the heritability of thermal traits, which sets a limit on
   evolutionary potential, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
   captured brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) from two populations that
   occur in contrasting thermal environments. We raised offspring from
   these populations in a laboratory common garden and compared the shape
   of their thermal performance curves to test for genetic divergence in
   thermal physiology. Thermal performance curves differed between
   populations in a common garden in ways partially consistent with
   divergent patterns of natural selection experienced by the source
   populations, implying that they had evolved in response to selection.
   Next, we estimated the heritability of thermal performance curves and of
   several traits related to thermoregulatory behaviour. We did not detect
   significant heritability in most components of the thermal performance
   curve or in several aspects of thermoregulatory behaviour, suggesting
   that contemporary selection is unlikely to result in rapid evolution.
   Our results indicate that the response to selection may be slow in the
   brown anole and that evolutionary change is unlikely to keep pace with
   current rates of environmental change.

AB Torpor, the most effective means of energy conservation available to
   endotherms, is still widely viewed as a specific adaptation in a few
   high-latitude, cold-climate endotherms with no adaptive function in warm
   regions. Nevertheless, a growing number of diverse terrestrial mammals
   and birds from low latitudes (0-30 degrees), including species from
   tropical and subtropical regions, are heterothermic and employ torpor.
   Use of torpor is especially important for bats because they are small,
   expend large amounts of energy when active, rely on a fluctuating food
   supply, and have only a limited capacity for storage of fat. Patterns of
   torpor in tropical/subtropical bats are highly variable, but short bouts
   of torpor with relatively high body temperatures (T-b) are most common.
   Hibernation (a sequence of multiday bouts of torpor) has been reported
   for free-ranging subtropical tree-dwelling vespertilionids,
   cave-dwelling hipposiderids, and house-dwelling molossids. The observed
   range of minimum T-b is similar to 6-30 degrees C, and the reduction of
   energy expenditure through the use of torpor, in comparison to
   normothermic values, ranges from 50 to 99%. Overall, torpor in the
   tropics/subtropics has been reported for 10 out of the currently
   recognized 18 bat families, which contain 1079 species, or 96.7% of all
   bats. Although it is unlikely that all of these are heterothermic, the
   large majority probably will be. Frequent use of torpor, including
   hibernation in diverse groups of tropical/subtropical bats, suggests
   that heterothermy is an ancestral chiropteran trait. Although data
   especially from the field are still scarce, it is likely that torpor,
   highly effective in reducing requirements for energy and water even
   under warm conditions, plays a crucial role in the long-term survival of
   the majority of small tropical and subtropical bats. Discovering how
   bats achieve this provides numerous opportunities for exiting new
   research.

AB Microtubules have been in the focus of biophysical research for several
   decades. However, the confusing and mutually contradictory results
   regarding their elasticity and fluctuations have cast doubt on their
   present understanding. In this paper, we present the empirical evidence
   for the existence of discrete guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-tubulin
   fluctuations between a curved and a straight configuration at room
   temperature as well as for conformational tubulin cooperativity. Guided
   by a number of experimental findings, we build the case for a novel
   microtubule model, with the principal result that microtubules can
   spontaneously form micron-sized cooperative helical states with unique
   elastic and dynamic features. The polymorphic dynamics of the
   microtubule lattice resulting from the tubulin bistability
   quantitatively explains several experimental puzzles, including
   anomalous scaling of dynamic fluctuations of grafted microtubules, their
   apparent length-stiffness relation, and their remarkable curved-helical
   appearance in general. We point out that the multistability and
   cooperative switching of tubulin dimers could participate in important
   cellular processes, and could in particular lead to efficient
   mechanochemical signaling along single microtubules.

AB Vertical variation in the distribution of rocky shore assemblages is
   greater than horizontal variation, as shown by univariate and
   multivariate analysis performed with data obtained along 1000 km of
   shoreline and covering from the upper supralittoral to the upper
   infralittoral zone (-1 m). Consequently, vertical littoral zonation is a
   consistent pattern at a regional scale within the same biogeographical
   zone. While their distribution varies at the same shore height, marine
   species and assemblages from rocky shores show a specific vertical
   sequence known as zonation. A key question in ecology is how consistent
   is zonation along large spatial scales. The aim of this study is to show
   distribution patterns of littoral assemblages at a regional scale and to
   identify the most relevant abiotic factors associated to such patterns.
   The study is based on a detailed and extensive survey at a regional
   scale on a tideless rocky shore. Benthic macroflora and macrofauna of
   750 releves were described along the vertical axis of 143 transects
   distributed across the shoreline of Catalonia (NW Mediterranean). The
   Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) first axis is highly related to
   the height on the shore: species, releves, and assemblages grade from
   lower to upper height (infralittoral to supralittoral). As observed in
   nature, different assemblages co-occur at the same height at different
   sites, which is shown along DCA second axis. The abiotic variables that
   best explain the assemblage distribution patterns are: height (75% of
   the model inertia), longitude (14.6%), latitude (7.2%) and transect
   slope (2.9%). The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) first axis is
   related to height on the shore and explains four times more variance
   than CCA second axis, which is related to the horizontal gradient.
   Generalized Lineal Model (GLM) results show that height on the shore is
   the factor explaining most of the variance in species presence. Most
   studied species show distribution patterns related to latitude and
   longitude, but always in a much smaller proportion than to height. (C)

AB Temporal and spatial patterns of bacteria and heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates (HNF) were studied monthly from January 1997 to December
   1998 in the middle Adriatic Sea. Bacterial and HNF relationships with
   phytoplankton biomass and temperature were analyzed to examine how the
   relative importance of bottom-up and top-down factors may shift over
   seasons and locations. For the coastal area, an inconsistent
   relationship between bacterial abundance and chlorophyll a and a
   stronger relationship between bacterial abundance and bacterial
   production suggest that other substrates than those of phytoplankton
   origin are important for bacteria. The analysis of simultaneous effects
   of temperature and bacterial production on bacterial abundance showed
   that the effect of temperature obscured the effects of bacterial
   production, suggesting that bacterial growth itself is highly
   temperature-dependent. The relationship between HNF abundance and
   bacterial abundance was slightly improved by the inclusion of in situ
   temperature, bacterial production or both parameters, as additional
   independent variables. About 60% of the variability in HNF abundance can
   be explained by bacterial abundance, bacterial production and
   temperature. In the open sea, tight coupling of bacterial abundance with
   chlorophyll a concentrations implied that phytoplankton-derived
   substrates have a dominant role in controlling bacterial abundance.
   During the colder months, bacterial abundance was high enough to support
   higher HNF abundance than observed, suggesting that predation exerted a
   minor depressing influence on bacterial abundance during that period.
   During the spring-summer period, HNF controlled bacterial standing
   stocks by direct cropping of bacterial production.

AB Although most species of animals examined to date exhibit Bergmann's
   clines in body size, squamates tend to exhibit opposing patterns.
   Squamates might exhibit reversed Bergmann's clines because they tend to
   behaviorally regulate their body temperature effectively; the outcome of
   this thermoregulation is that warmer environments enable longer daily
   and annual durations of activity than cooler environments. Lizards of
   the genus Sceloporus provide an opportunity to understand the factors
   that give rise to contrasting thermal clines in body size because S.
   undulatus exhibits a standard Bergmann's cline whereas S. graciosus
   exhibits a reverse Bergmann's cline. Interestingly, rapid growth by
   individuals of both species involves adjustments of physiological
   processes that enable more efficient use of food. Patterns of adult body
   size are likely the evolutionary consequence of variation in juvenile
   survivorship among populations. In S. undulatus, delayed maturation at a
   relatively large body size is exhibited in cooler environments where
   juveniles experience higher survivorship, resulting in a Bergmann's
   cline. In S. graciosus, high juvenile survivorship is not consistently
   found in cooler environments, resulting in no cline or a reversed
   Bergmann's cline, i.e., geographic patterns in body size aren't
   necessarily produced by natural selection. Thus, discerning the
   mechanistic links between the thermal physiology of an organism and
   environment-specific rates of mortality will be critical to
   understanding the evolution of body size in relation to environmental
   temperature.

AB The lack of standardization of methods and procedures have hindered
   agreement in the literature related to time-of-day effects on repeated
   sprint performance and needs clarification. Therefore, the aim of the
   present study was to investigate and systematically review the evidence
   relating to time-of-day based on performance measures in
   repeated-sprints. The entire content of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus,
   SPORTDiscus (R) (via EBSCOhost) and Web of Science was searched. Only
   experimental research studies conducted in male adult participants aged
   >= 18yrs, published in English before June 2019 were included. Studies
   assessing repeated-sprints between a minimum of two time-points during
   the day (morning versus evening) were deemed eligible. The primary
   search revealed that a total of 10 out of 112 articles were considered
   eligible and subsequently included. Seven articles were deemed strong
   and three moderate quality. Eight studies found repeated-sprint
   performance across the first, first few, or all sprints, to increase in
   favor of the evening. The magnitude of difference is dependent on the
   modality and the exercise protocol used. The non-motorized treadmill
   established an average 3.5-8.5% difference in distance covered, average
   and peak velocity, and average power, across all sprints in three
   studies and in peak power in two studies. In cycling, power output
   differed across all sprints by 6.0% in one study and 8.0% for the first
   sprint only in five studies. All four studies measuring power decrement
   values (i.e. rate of fatigue) established differences up to 4.0% and two
   out of five studies established total work to be significantly higher by
   8.0%. Repeated-sprint performance is affected by time-of-day with
   greater performance in the late/early afternoon. The magnitude is
   dependent on the variable assessed and the mode of exercise. There is a
   clear demand for more rigorous investigations which control factors that
   specifically relate to investigations of time-of-day and are specific to
   the sport of individuals.

AB In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that
   maintain fitness across a range of conditions. However, costs of
   adaptation may generate fitness trade-offs and lead to some compromise
   between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here,
   we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20
   populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in
   constant and variable thermal environments for 3 years. We developed
   genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we
   measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant
   environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable
   environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our
   predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and
   spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal
   variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered
   by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically,
   genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more
   fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other
   environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should
   inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating
   environments.

AB While the responses of photosynthesis to water stress have been widely
   studied, acclimation to sustained water stress and recovery after
   re-watering is poorly understood. In particular, the factors limiting
   photosynthesis under these conditions, and their possible interactions
   with other environmental conditions, are unknown. To assess these
   issues, changes of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A(N)) and its
   underlying limitations were followed during prolonged water stress and
   subsequent re-watering in tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) plants growing
   under three different climatic conditions: outdoors in summer, outdoors
   in spring, and indoors in a growth chamber. In particular, the
   regulation of stomatal conductance (g(s)), mesophyll conductance to CO2
   (g(m)), leaf photochemistry (chlorophyll fluorescence), and biochemistry
   (V-c,V-max) were assessed. Leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll
   fluorescence data revealed that water stress induced a similar degree of
   stomatal closure and decreased A(N) under all three conditions, while
   V-c,V-max was unaffected. However, the behaviour of g(m) differed
   depending on the climatic conditions. In outdoor plants, g(m) strongly
   declined with water stress, but it recovered rapidly (1-2 d) after
   re-watering in spring while it remained low many days after re-watering
   in summer. In indoor plants, g(m) initially declined with water stress,
   but then recovered to control values during the acclimation period.
   These differences were reflected in different velocities of recovery of
   A(N) after re-watering, being the slowest in outdoor summer plants and
   the fastest in indoor plants. It is suggested that these differences
   among the experiments are related to the prevailing climatic conditions,
   i.e. to the fact that stress factors other than water stress have been
   superimposed (e.g. excessive light and elevated temperature). In
   conclusion, besides g(s), g(m) contributes greatly to the limitation of
   photosynthesis during water stress and during recovery from water
   stress, but its role is strongly dependent on the impact of additional
   environmental factors.

AB Circadian clocks organize a wide array of metabolic functions in a
   coherent daily schedule and ensure synchrony of this schedule with
   environmental rhythms. Daily rhythmicity of lipid metabolism occurs in
   rodents and ruminants. We examined daily level variations of serum
   lipids (nonesterified fatty acids [NEFA], triglycerides, phospholipids,
   total cholesterol and total lipids) in healthy dogs, particularly
   focusing on their temporal relationship to lighting and fasting cycles.
   Whereas serum NEFA levels did not change across the day, levels of total
   lipids, total cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides occurred in
   dogs maintained under 12:12-h light:dark cycles and fed a single meal
   daily. Only the rhythmic pattern of triglycerides responded to a 6 h
   delay in light onset, suggesting a cardinal role of a light-entrained
   circadian oscillator in its generation. To investigate whether temporal
   variations in serum lipids depend to physiological postprandial changes,
   we measured lipid levels in fasted dogs. Rhythms of total lipids, total
   cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides vanished when dogs were
   food-deprived, indicating that these rhythms are driven by the digestive
   process. Levels of serum NEFA patterns were significantly higher during
   fasting than after food intake. The increase of NEFA concentrations
   during fasting may reflect the mobilization of adipose tissue NEFA
   mediated by the decrease in insulin with its lypolitic effects.
   Elucidating the daily rhythmicity of lipid levels is fundamental to
   understanding the metabolism of the dog, an animal model frequently used
   for research in metabolic pathophysiology.

AB The occurrence of lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) complex on the
   southeast United States shelf represents one of the first documented
   invasions of a Pacific marine fish species into the western Atlantic
   Ocean. Temperature has been proposed as a possible factor limiting the
   range of this introduction. To examine this hypothesis,
   temperature-tolerance studies were conducted following the chronic
   lethal minimum protocol, with death as the endpoint. Overall, the mean
   chronic lethal minimum was 10.0degreesC and mean temperature at feeding
   cessation was 16.1degreesC. Rate of temperature decrease and acclimation
   temperature did not have a significant effect on chronic lethal minimum
   or temperature at feeding cessation. When combined with mean February
   water temperatures, lionfish thermal tolerance data indicated that
   lionfish could overwinter on the southeast United States continental
   shelf, with a northern limit of Cape Hatteras and an inshore limit
   coincident with the mean 12degreesC isotherm, which equates to a
   10degreesC minimum water temperature. The mean 12degreesC bottom
   isotherm also runs along the continental shelf break (200 m isobath),
   marking the offshore limit for lionfish on the southeast United States
   continental shelf. The current southern limit of the invasion is not
   bound by temperature, as lionfish could survive (but have not yet been
   reported) on the Florida coast south of Miami, throughout the Gulf of
   Mexico and Caribbean Sea, extending into the southern hemisphere.
   Possible reasons for the constrained southern limit may include
   planktonic transport mechanisms, patterns of juvenile and adult
   movements, and the initial lionfish introduction site.

AB During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin
   filaments (< 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive
   the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of
   the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In
   addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and
   pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone.
   In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the
   self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic
   crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin
   filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered
   bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic
   properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that
   these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of
   elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10k(B)T per crosslinker).
   This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence
   of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin
   filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers
   attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be
   used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle,
   we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by
   ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.

   species, Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus,
   spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and silver hake Merluccius bilinearis,
   are related to depth, temperature, substrate and time-block for the fall
   and spring of a 35 yr time period in the Gulf of Maine - Georges Bank
   region. We examined the relative importance of each factor and how
   relative importance changes with season. Size increased with depth
   during both seasons for G. morhua and for M. aeglefinus during the fall,
   but decreased with depth for M. aeglefinus during the spring. Haddock
   size class distributions in the spring were also related to bottom
   temperature, with smaller individuals generally occurring in the warmest
   waters; For S. acanthias, depth was also the primary environmental
   variable explaining size class distributions in the fall, although size
   decreased with depth for this species. In the spring, bottom temperature
   was more important for spiny dogfish with smaller individuals associated
   with warmer bottom waters. Similarly, bottom temperature had the most
   explanatory value for M bilinearis during both seasons, with size
   increasing with temperature. Seasonal associations with depth and
   temperature are related to spawning migrations, thermal preferences and
   other ecological factors. Time-block accounted for a notable amount of
   variance, particularly for S, acanthias and M bilinearis, and was
   reflective of how population size structure has responded to
   exploitation over the time series. The local-scale relationships between
   abundance and substrate previously established for some species were not
   strong at the broader spatial scale we examined. Understanding how
   habitat associations change with ontogeny will aid in refining spatial
   fisheries management approaches and in delineating essential fish
   habitat.

AB A series of empirically-derived equations were developed from data
   spanning the 32 year history (1969-2000) that predict or reconstruct
   water temperatures of the inflowing river, the near surface or
   epilimnion, and the deep and outflowing waters of subtropical Canyon
   Reservoir on the Guadalupe River in southcentral Texas, USA. Inflowing
   and near surface water temperatures both can be predicted from local air
   temperatures. We used a 5 day or I day (in the case of high inflows
   associated with storm fronts) averaging period of air temperature for
   the river and a 30 day period for the reservoir surface water.
   Predictions of deep water and outflow temperatures were more complex in
   this bottom-draining reservoir. During the winter months, when the
   reservoir was nearest to being isothermal, air temperature was the
   primary factor used to predict deep temperatures. For the remainder of
   the year, the rate at which water was released from the reservoir tended
   to be the most important factor in predicting deep temperatures,
   although the air temperature of the previous winter could also be
   important. During drier years, the cold hypolinmetic waters are retained
   throughout the stratified period, and outflows were as cool as 12-13
   degrees C in August and September. During very wet years the cold
   hypolinmetic waters are lost downstream early, and August and September
   outflows may be as warm as 23-24 degrees C. Therefore, interannual
   variation in the temperature of the hypolimnion and tailwaters is quite
   high. This represents a thermal stress to the local biota that is very
   different from the idea of "thermal constancy" commonly associated with
   other reservoir tailwater habitats. Because of this reservoir's
   particular sensitivity to variation in flow, projections of future
   change in runoff (as the climate changes) may have a greater effect on
   the thermal environment of this reservoir than will change in
   atmospheric temperature.

AB Even though exhaustively studied, dormancy alleviation in diaspores of
   Urochloa humidicola (Rendle) Morrone & Zuloaga remains a mystery. To
   clarify this, we asked the following question: could dormancy
   alleviation in diaspores of this species be associated with ageing,
   GA/ABA balance and remaining structures of the panicoid spikelet? We
   answer this question using diaspores of U.humidicola cv. BRS Tupi as a
   biological model, a cultivar with a wide edaphoclimatic range in
   Neotropical areas and whose diaspores possess deep dormancy' when
   dispersed. We analysed both germination and early plant development
   using a split-plot model. Our findings demonstrate that dormancy
   alleviation in diaspores of U.humidicola is a synergic phenomenon driven
   by crosstalk between age, GA/ABA balance and remaining structures of the
   panicoid spikelet covering caryopses, since this interaction acts on the
   dynamics of germination and early plant development. We demonstrate
   that: (i) spreading germination time is a maternal survival mechanism of
   this species, which has repercussions for occupational aggressiveness of
   the species; (ii) remaining structures of the panicoid spikelet covering
   caryopses are the main modulator of embryo development. These structures
   control the after-ripening process, which is modulated by some molecular
   factor. We also highlight that it is necessary to review concepts about
   dormancy of dispersal units in this grass species.

AB Sea trout (Salmo trutta) originating from small coastal streams can be
   found at sea throughout the year, in contrast to conspecifics from
   larger rivers, which typically spend the autumn and winter in fresh
   water. Such an extended marine stay has been observed in coastal
   Skagerrak. We studied the seasonal variation in marine growth of
   Skagerrak sea trout based on scale increment patterns and body lengths
   of 563 individuals captured at sea. Growth, measured as increased body
   length, was rapid during summer while there was no evidence for
   continued growth during autumn and winter. Growth decreased with
   increasing age of the fish. Our results suggest that coastal Skagerrak
   is an important feeding area for sea trout during summer, and that an
   extended marine stay during autumn and winter may have trade-off
   benefits other than somatic growth. Alternative benefits might be
   increased winter survival and decreased migratory costs of juvenile
   fish.

AB Long-term assessments of bio-thermal responses in a hair coat sheep
   breed were performed to investigate the effect of the thermal
   environment on their physiological performance and thermal balance.
   Twelve healthy non-lactating Morada Nova ewes (3 +/- 1.2 years old, body
   mass 32.7 +/- 3.7 kg) were assigned in two 12 x 12 Latin square designs
   (from 07:00 to 19:00 h and from 19:00 to 07:00 h, respectively) for
   assessments of their biothermal responses during 24 consecutive days.
   There was a monophasic pattern in the ambient temperature (T-A), which
   ranged between 21 and 38 degrees C, thereby exposing the ewes to
   different levels of surrounding T-A over the day and influencing several
   of their bio-thermal responses (P = 0.0001). Their body temperatures
   (i.e., rectal, skin, and hair coat surface temperatures) gradually
   increased (P = 0.0001) from 04:00 h. The mean peak for rectal
   temperature (39.3 degrees C) was recorded at 19:00 h, while for skin and
   hair coat surface temperatures it occurred at 13:00 and 14:00 h,
   respectively. The sensible heat loss by long wave radiation and surface
   convection exceeded the metabolism of ewes when the T-A was below 24
   degrees C, which usually occurred between 24:00 and 06:00 h. During
   exposure to higher ambient temperatures, the sheep increased respiratory
   evaporative heat loss, without panting. In conclusion, the sheep
   regulated rectal temperature within a relatively narrow range of 1.4
   degrees C over 24 h, and appear to be well adapted to coping with heat.
   Minimum 24 h body temperature was correlated with minimum T-A,
   indicating that heat conservation strategies are likely to be important
   for Morada Nova sheep in a tropical biotype at night, when rates of
   sensible heat loss exceed the heat generated by metabolism.

AB Global warming is increasing the overheating risk for many organisms,
   though the potential for plasticity in thermal tolerance to mitigate
   this risk is largely unknown. In part, this shortcoming stems from a
   lack of knowledge about global and taxonomic patterns of variation in
   tolerance plasticity. To address this critical issue, we test leading
   hypotheses for broad-scale variation in ectotherm tolerance plasticity
   using a dataset that includes vertebrate and invertebrate taxa from
   terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Contrary to expectation,
   plasticity in heat tolerance was unrelated to latitude or thermal
   seasonality. However, plasticity in cold tolerance is associated with
   thermal seasonality in some habitat types. In addition, aquatic taxa
   have approximately twice the plasticity of terrestrial taxa. Based on
   the observed patterns of variation in tolerance plasticity, we propose
   that limited potential for behavioural plasticity (i.e. behavioural
   thermoregulation) favours the evolution of greater plasticity in
   physiological traits, consistent with the 'Bogert effect'. Finally, we
   find that all ectotherms have relatively low acclimation in thermal
   tolerance and demonstrate that overheating risk will be minimally
   reduced by acclimation in even the most plastic groups. Our analysis
   indicates that behavioural and evolutionary mechanisms will be critical
   in allowing ectotherms to buffer themselves from extreme temperatures.

   precipitation. The RaMPs experiment is located in a native tallgrass
   prairie at the Konza Prairie Biological Station and has been operational
   since 1998 providing the potential to address responses to long-term
   environmental manipulations. To test whether community composition,
   richness, or diversity respond to environmental change, more than 40 000
   fungal amplicons were analyzed from soil samples collected in 2006. The
   data suggest that soil fungal communities are compositionally resilient
   to predicted environmental change. This is the case both for the
   community composition overall as inferred from ordination analyses as
   well as analyses of variance for each of the most common Operational
   Taxonomic Units (OTUs). However, while this study suggests compositional
   resilience, further studies are required to address functional
   attributes of these communities and their responses to environmental
   manipulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological

AB Sponges are an important component of temperate subtidal marine
   ecosystems, with a range of important functional roles and extensive
   symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. However, much remains
   unknown about their relationships with these symbiotic microorganisms,
   and specifically, the role that these symbionts play in sponge
   physiology, feeding and adaptation to local environmental conditions.
   Changes in environmental factors may alter relationships between sponges
   and their symbionts, which could conceivably influence the abundance and
   distribution patterns of some temperate sponge species. Here, we
   analyzed the effect of transplantation of sponges between different
   habitats to test the effect of changes in environmental conditions on
   the stability of the bacterial communities in specimens of Tethya
   bergquistae and Ecionemia alata, based on pyrosequencing of amplified
   16S rRNA genes. Bacterial communities differed markedly between the two
   host species. While some morphological changes were observed in
   transplanted sponges, transplantation had little overall effect on
   sponge-associated bacterial communities at either phylum or 97%-OTU
   level. Our results show the importance of host species and also the
   stability of sponge-associated bacterial communities under environmental
   variation.

AB Soil respiration is the largest carbon (C) flux from terrestrial
   ecosystems into the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of the magnitude and
   distribution of soil respiration are critically important to models of
   global C cycling and predictions of future climate change. One of the
   greatest challenges to accurate large-scale estimation of soil
   respiration is its great spatial heterogeneity at the site level. Our
   study explored how soil respiration varies in space and the drivers that
   lead to this variance in a natural subtropical evergreen broadleaf
   forest in Southern China. We conducted a two-year soil respiration
   measurement for 168 randomly selected sampling points in a 4 ha plot. We
   measured the spatial variance of soil respiration and tested its
   correlation to a variety of abiotic and biotic factors including
   topography, aboveground plant community structure, soil environmental
   factors, soil organic matter, and microbial community structure. We
   found that soil respiration was highly varied across the study plot,
   with a spatial variation coefficient (CV) of 32.75%. The structural
   equation modeling (SEM) analysis showed that elevation influenced tree
   species diversity, productivity, and soil water content, which in turn
   affected soil respiration via soil C content, clay content,
   fungal:bacterial ratio, annual litterfall, and fine root biomass. 31% of
   the total spatial variation of soil respiration was accounted for in the
   SEM, mostly by elevation, soil C content, annual litterfall biomass,
   tree species diversity as estimated by the Simpson's index, and soil
   water content, with standardized total effects of 0.31, -0.31, 0.29,
   0.19, and -0.18, respectively. Our data demonstrated that soil
   respiration was highly spatially varied at the fine scale, and was
   primarily regulated by factors of topography and plant community
   structure. More studies investigating the spatial variation of soil
   respiration are therefore needed to better understand and assess
   terrestrial ecosystem C cycling.

AB The abundance and distribution of many benthic marine organisms are
   shaped by the success of their dispersive larval life-history stage. An
   increasing number of studies have shown that ocean acidification
   negatively impacts the larval life-history stage, including those of
   echinoids which are commercially and ecologically important. However,
   little is known about the behavioral responses of echinoid larvae to
   different pH levels in the water column. Changes in vertical movement in
   response to the naturally occurring pH variations caused by biological
   activities and/or physical conditions could affect dispersal and
   recruitment. In this study, we quantified the vertical distribution of
   larval sand dollars, Dendraster excentricus (Echinodermata), in water
   columns with stratified layers of seawater varying in salinity and pH.
   When larval sand dollars swimming upwards in ambient seawater (pH(NBS)
   7.86 +/- 0.04) encountered a layer of low pH (pH(NBS) 7.54 +/- 0.04)
   seawater, about half of the individuals (53 +/- 28%) were aggregated
   near the transition layer 60 min after the start of the experiment.
   Preliminary video analysis showed larvae reversed their direction of
   travel and altered the shape of their helical swimming trajectories,
   upon encountering the transition layer moving from ambient to low pH
   water. In contrast, when larval sand dollars swimming upwards in
   acidified seawater encountered ambient seawater, they continued to swim
   upward to aggregate near the top of the column. In control water columns
   with uniform pH, larvae did not change swimming behavior regardless of
   whether pH was ambient or acidified and whether salinity was uniform or
   stratified. These results indicate that stratification itself did not
   strongly affect the vertical distributions of larvae. These observations
   suggest that echinoid larvae, and perhaps many other types of planktonic
   larvae, may use behavioral plasticity to reduce exposure to stresses
   from ocean acidification. The presence and effectiveness of these
   responses may improve the ability of larvae to cope with stressful,
   dynamic habitats, and hence may be significant to prediction of
   potential impacts of global climate change.

AB The great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus) is a large-sized bat in
   the New World family Phyllostomidae. It is widely distributed and
   sometimes very abundant in different Brazilian biomes, in natural and
   anthropic environments. Studies in the tropics have found evidence of a
   decrease in A. lituratus captures during the winter, a dry and cold
   season with low fruit availability, especially in higher latitudes.
   However, the causes for the decrease in captures are poorly understood.
   The objective of this study was to test the influence of temperature and
   fruit availability on capture rates of A. lituratus in a fragmented
   Atlantic Forest landscape. Results indicate that temperature is the main
   variable that explains the changes in the number of captures of A.
   lituratus throughout the year, and that fruit availability plays only an
   adjacent role. In addition, we highlight possible negative consequences
   of climate change on the survival of this species.

AB The circadian clock is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic gene
   regulation that is emerging as an exemplar genetic sub-network for
   systems biology. The circadian system in Arabidopsis plants is complex,
   in part due to its phototransduction pathways, which are themselves
   under circadian control. We therefore analysed two simpler experimental
   systems. Etiolated seedlings entrained by temperature cycles showed
   circadian rhythms in the expression of genes that are important for the
   clock mechanism, but only a restricted set of downstream target genes
   were rhythmic in microarray assays. Clock control of phototransduction
   pathways remained robust across a range of light inputs, despite the
   arrhythmic transcription of light-signalling genes. Circadian
   interactions with light signalling were then analysed using a single
   active photoreceptor. Phytochrome A (phyA) is expected to be the only
   active photoreceptor that can mediate far-red (FR) light input to the
   circadian clock. Surprisingly, rhythmic gene expression was profoundly
   altered under constant FR light, in a phyA-dependent manner, resulting
   in high expression of evening genes and low expression of morning genes.
   Dark intervals were required to allow high-amplitude rhythms across the
   transcriptome. Clock genes involved in this response were identified by
   mutant analysis, showing that the EARLY FLOWERING 4 gene is a likely
   target and mediator of the FR effects. Both experimental systems
   illustrate how profoundly the light input pathways affect the plant
   circadian clock, and provide strong experimental manipulations to
   understand critical steps in the plant clock mechanism.

AB Stream fishes often exhibit a bet-hedging multiple spawning reproductive
   strategy. In many species, the reproductive season lasts several months.
   This exposes young fishes to varying environmental conditions that may
   differentially affect growth. We studied the effect of hatch date on
   first-summer growth among members of a prairie-stream fish assemblage.
   The reproductive season in both years of the study was protracted,
   lasting from April through August. Due to intermittent stream-discharge,
   there were two distinct periods during which most species successfully
   reproduced. In general, growth rate was greater among individuals with
   an early hatch date than among those with a later hatch date. Multiple
   regression models indicated that hatch date was related to growth in all
   study species with one exception (red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis). The
   results of this study provide evidence that young-of-the-year of
   multiple spawning stream-fish species that are spawned late in the
   season may grow at a slower rate than young spawned earlier in the
   season.

AB AimLeaf traits strongly impact biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Understanding leaf trait variation along environmental
   gradients is thus essential to improve the representation of vegetation
   in Earth system models. Our aims were to quantify relationships between
   leaf traits and climate in permanent grasslands at a biogeographical
   scale and to test whether these relationships were sensitive to (a) the
   level of nitrogen inputs and (b) the inclusion of information pertaining
   to plant community organization.
   LocationPermanent grasslands throughout France.
   MethodsWe combined existing datasets on climate, soil, nitrogen inputs
   (fertilization and deposition), species composition and four traits,
   namely specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen and
   phosphorus concentrations, for 15,865 French permanent grasslands.
   Trait-climate relationships were tested using the following four
   climatic variables available across 1,833 pixels (5 kmx5 km): mean
   annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), and two indices
   accounting for the length of the growing season. We compared these
   relationships at the pixel level using either using community-level or
   species' trait means.
   ResultsOur findings were as follows: (a) leaf traits related to plant
   nutrient economy shift consistently along a gradient of growing season
   length accounting for temperature and soil water limitations of plant
   growth (GSL(tw)); (b) weighting leaf traits by species abundance in
   local communities is pivotal to capture leaf trait-environment
   relationships correctly at a biogeographical scale; and (c) the
   relationships between traits and GSL(tw) weaken for grasslands with a
   high nitrogen input.
   Main conclusionsThe effects of climate on plant communities are better
   described using composite descriptors than coarse variables such as MAT
   or MAP, but appear weaker for high-nitrogen grasslands. Using
   information at the community level tends to strengthen trait-climate
   relationships. The interplay of land management, community assembly and
   bioclimate appears crucial to the prediction of leaf trait variations
   and their effects on biogeochemical cycles.

AB Main conclusion CaLCuV-based VIGS effectively works in cabbage and
   contributes to efficient functional genomics research in Brassica crop
   species. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), a posttranscriptional gene
   silencing method, is an effective technique for analysing the functions
   of genes in plants. However, no VIGS vectors have been available
   forBrassica oleraceauntil now. Here,tobacco rattle virus(TRV), pTYs
   andcabbage leaf curl virus(CaLCuV) gene-silencing vectors (PCVA/PCVB)
   were chosen to improve the VIGS system in cabbage using thephytoene
   desaturase(PDS) gene as an efficient visual indicator of VIGS. We
   successfully silenced the expression ofPDSand observed photobleaching
   phenomena in cabbage in response to pTYs and CaLCuV, with the latter
   being more easy to operate and less expensive. The parameters
   potentially affecting the silencing efficiency of VIGS by CaLCuV in
   cabbage, including the targeting fragment strategy, inoculation method
   and incubation temperature, were then compared. The optimized
   CaLCuV-based VIGS system involves the following: an approximately 500 bp
   insert sequence, anAgrobacteriumOD(600)of 1.0, use of the vacuum osmosis
   method applied at the bud stage, and an incubation temperature of 22
   degrees C. Using these parameters, we achieved a stable silencing
   efficiency of 65%. To further test the effectiveness of the system, we
   selected theMg-chelatase H subunit(ChlH) gene in cabbage and knocked
   down its expression, and we observed yellow leaves, as expected. We
   successfully applied the CaLCuV-based VIGS system to two other
   representative Brassica crop species,B. rapaandB. nigra, and thus
   expanded the application scope of this system. Our VIGS system described
   here will contribute to efficient functional genomics research in
   Brassica crop species.

AB If Southern Ocean plankton communities are changing in response to
   climate, biases in various nets need to be evaluated to help understand
   regional and temporal differences between historical and contemporary
   sample collections. A comparison of the catching ability of a Bongo net
   (mesh aperture 200 mu m) and a reconstructed version of an N70 net
   (upper mesh aperture 445 mu m, lower mesh aperture 195 mu m) as used by
   the Discovery Investigations was therefore undertaken. Forty Bongo and
   forty N70 samples were obtained from 10 stations in the Southern Ocean
   during December 2009. Bongo net catch abundance was similar to 3 times
   greater than the N70 and similar to 4 times greater when only copepod
   instars < 0.5 mm body length were considered. The Bongo net captured
   more plankton at all chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations encountered,
   although the difference was less at high Chl a when the N70 appeared to
   filter all size classes of copepod more efficiently, as well as
   retaining a relatively greater proportion of non-copepod plankton.
   Application of these findings was made to a previous study in which N70
   samples from 1926/1927 were compared to a series of Bongo net hauls made
   post-1995. By 'correcting' abundances for net bias among a common set of
   45 taxa, N70 data were within the range of variability seen in the Bongo
   net samples. Making such inter-net comparisons allows us to use
   historical collections and better judge the nature and magnitude of
   change in these plankton communities.

AB The supply of planktonic larvae to adult populations is an important
   contributor to the spatial and temporal variability of benthic marine
   organisms. The ability to predict spatial patterns of larvae and
   recruits from the physical and biological processes that facilitate
   dispersal is required in order to advise and evaluate conservation and
   fisheries management decisions. In the present study, the horizontal
   distribution of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) and red rock crab
   (Cancer productus) zoeae was described from surveys conducted in the
   Strait of Georgia in the spring of 2009 and 2010. Processes that maybe
   responsible for generating spatial variability of larvae were evaluated
   based on (i) horizontal overlap between larvae and water properties,
   (ii) spatial dependence of larvae and water properties, and (iii)
   changes in the dispersion of stage-specific distributions. Interspecific
   variability between horizontal patterns of the first and second larval
   stages was primarily attributed to differences in the distribution of
   larval release locations, which appeared to be restricted to the
   southern and central strait for C. magister. Potential effects of
   physical processes on larval distributions are also discussed.

AB Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to
   maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic
   effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal
   sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the
   consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in
   their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable
   conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental
   conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles
   from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity
   in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from
   environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal
   sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that
   differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24
   degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C).
   DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing
   DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats
   (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable
   habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the

   DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6
   degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal
   variability may favour some species while others are negatively
   impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by
   buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.

AB A calibration data set of 51 surface sediment samples from Lake Donggi
   Cona on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau was investigated to study the
   relationship between sub-fossil ostracod assemblages and water depth.
   Samples were collected over a depth range from 0.6 to 80 m. A total of
   16 ostracod species was identified from the lake with about half of the
   species restricted to the Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain
   ranges and poorly known in terms of ecological preferences, and the
   other half displaying a mainly Holarctic distribution. Living
   macrophytes and macroalgae were recorded in Lake Donggi Cona down to a
   depth of about 30 m, and bivalve (Pisidium cf. zugmayeri) and gastropod
   (Gyraulus, Radix) shells were found down to depths of 43 and 48 m,
   respectively. The ostracod-water-depth relationship was assessed by
   multivariate statistical analysis and ostracod-based transfer functions
   for water depth were constructed. Weighted averaging partial least
   squares (WA-PLS) regression provided the best model with a coefficient
   of determination r (2) of 0.91 between measured and ostracod-inferred
   water depth, a root mean square error of prediction of 8% and a maximum
   bias of 10.6% of the gradient length, as assessed by leave-one-out
   cross-validation. Our results show the potential of ostracods as
   palaeo-depth indicators in appropriate settings. However,
   transfer-function applications using fossil ostracod assemblages for
   palaeo-depth estimations require a thorough understanding of the
   palaeolimnological conditions of lakes and therefore detailed
   multi-proxy analysis to avoid misinterpretation of ostracod-based
   inferences.

AB ATP synthase (F-ATPase) produces ATP at the expense of ion-motive force
   or vice versa. It is composed from two motor/generators, the ATPase
   (F-1) and the ion translocator (F-0), which both are rotary steppers.
   They are mechanically coupled by 360 degrees rotary motion of subunits
   against each other. The rotor, subunits gamma epsilonc(10-14), moves
   against the stator, (alpha beta)(3)delta ab(2.) The enzyme copes with
   symmetry mismatch (C-3 versus C10-14) between its two motors, and it
   operates robustly in chimeric constructs or with drastically modified
   subunits. We scrutinized whether an elastic power transmission accounts
   for these properties. We used the curvature of fluorescent actin
   filaments, attached to the rotating c ring, as a spring balance
   (flexural rigidity of 8.10(-26) N m(2)) to gauge the angular profile of
   the output torque at F0 during ATP hydrolysis by F-1. The large average
   output torque (56 pN nm) proved the absence of any slip. Angular
   variations of the torque were small, so that the output free energy of
   the loaded enzyme decayed almost linearly over the angular reaction
   coordinate. Considering the three-fold stepping and high activation
   barrier ( > 40 kJ/mol) of the driving motor (Fl) itself, the rather
   constant output torque seen by F0 implied a soft elastic power
   transmission between F-1 and F-0. It is considered as essential, not
   only for the robust operation of this ubiquitous enzyme under symmetry
   mismatch, but also for a high turnover rate under load of the two
   counteracting and stepping motors/generators. (C) 2001 Federation of

AB This paper concerns the applicability of the cross-correlation technique
   for the assessment of shifts of the circadian system (e.g., caused by
   night work). Melatonin and cortisol profiles of 52 healthy young men
   were ascertained during two 24 h phase assessment procedures. The first
   was performed after three consecutive day shifts, and the second was
   performed one week later on 24 men again after three day shifts and on
   28 men after three night shifts, where adaptation to night work was
   accelerated by bright light. The cross-correlation technique that relies
   on the processing of all the measured data of a whole profile, as
   compared to the differences between temporal parameters determined with
   a conventional method, provided reliable estimates of the phase shifts.
   Its applicability is restricted to time series with similar profiles
   assessed at different times and to observation periods of a full diurnal
   cycle (in the case of substantial shifts) with equally distributed
   measures, but it is applicable to raw data and available in common
   statistical packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS, BMDP).

AB Background. The common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus (Linnaeus, 1758), is
   widely distributed in the Black and the Mediterranean seas. Therefore, P
   erythrinus is a valuable component of the commercial fishery in Tunisia
   and plays an important role in microeconomics of local areas. The goal
   of this study was to investigate the stock structure and otolith
   asymmetry for specimens of the common pandora sampled from two
   lagoons-Ghar El Melh and Bizerte.
   Materials and methods. We collected a total of 119 specimens of P.
   erythrinus from the two lagoons, from May through July 2016. The
   Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) was determined to evaluate the degree
   of similarity in the otoliths and detect the reciprocal variability.
   Results. The Discriminant Factor Analysis for the sagitta shape clearly
   demonstrated an asymmetry when comparing otoliths (left-right) (P <
   0.05) within each population and a difference in shape when comparing
   the same side between the two populations: between the two sides
   (right-right and left-left).
   Conclusion. The comparison of the otolith morphology of the two
   populations showed a clear difference in shape and a left-right
   asymmetry of otoliths between and within populations. This result is
   probably related to genetic and local environmental factors. In fact,
   this investigation improves the knowledge on the stock discrimination
   for P. erythrinus and provides useful information for analysing
   fisheries management of this species in Tunisia.

AB In Drosophila melanogaster, body pigmentation is a quantitative trait
   that depends on developmental temperature. When investigated over the
   whole thermal range of the species, pigmentation exhibits nonlinear
   reaction norms that differ among segments. The isofemale line method was
   used to analyse the genetic variability in two natural populations that
   affected the shape of reaction norms. Each line was considered as an
   experimental repeat, and polynomial reaction norms fitted to calculate
   the characteristic values (eg the coordinates of a maximum). In total,
   20 lines from two geographically distant populations ( France and India)
   were investigated at seven developmental temperatures (12-31degreesC) in
   two successive generations (G2 and G3). We analysed the genetic
   repeatability (ie the correlation between generations) of three kinds of
   parameters: intraclass correlation coefficients ( isofemale
   heritability), family means at different temperatures and the
   characteristic values of the reaction norms. For intraclass correlation,
   a low genetic repeatability was found. For family mean values grown at
   various temperatures, an overall positive and highly significant
   repeatability was found (r = 0.55 +/- 0.024). Finally, a positive
   significant G2-G3 correlation was also the rule for the characteristic
   values of the reaction norms. Significant differences could be found
   between values describing either the trait or its plasticity, but with
   no general trend. A slightly higher repeatability was observed in the
   Indian population. These results show that, with a family selection
   design, the shape of the reaction norms might be modified in various
   ways.

AB The present study was focused on lettuce, a widely consumed leafy
   vegetable for the large number of healthy phenolic compounds. Two
   differently-pigmented lettuce cultivars, i.e. an acyanic-green leaf cv.
   and an anthocyanic-red one, were grown under high light intensity or
   elevated CO2 or both in order to evaluate how environmental conditions
   may affect the production of secondary phenolic metabolites and, thus,
   lettuce quality. Mild light stress imposed for a short time under
   ambient or elevated CO2 concentration increased phenolics compounds as
   well as antioxidant capacity in both lettuce cvs, indicating how the
   cultivation practice could enhance the health-promoting benefits of
   lettuce. The phenolic profile depended on pigmentation and the
   anthocyanic-red cv. always maintained a higher phenolic amount as well
   as antioxidant capacity than the acyanic-green one. In particular,
   quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, kaempferol, quercitrin and rutin
   accumulated under high light or high CO2 in the anthocyanic-red cv.,
   whereas cyanidin derivatives were responsive to mild light stress, both
   at ambient and elevated CO2. In both cvs total free and conjugated
   phenolic acids maintained higher values under all altered environmental
   conditions, whereas luteolin reached significant amounts when both
   stresses were administered together, indicating, in this last case, that
   the enzymatic regulation of the flavonoid synthesis could be differently
   affected, the synthesis of flavones being favored.

AB Detecting latitudinal range shifts of forest trees in response to recent
   climate change is difficult because of slow demographic rates and
   limited dispersal but may be facilitated by spatially compressed
   climatic zones along elevation gradients in montane environments. We
   resurveyed forest plots established in 1964 along elevation transects in
   the Green Mountains (Vermont) to examine whether a shift had occurred in
   the location of the northern hardwood-boreal forest ecotone (NBE) from
   1964 to 2004. We found a 19% increase in dominance of northern
   hard-woods from 70% in 1964 to 89% in 2004 in the lower half of the NBE.
   This shift was driven by a decrease (up to 76%) in boreal and increase
   (up to 16%) in northern hardwood basal area within the lower portions of
   the ecotone. We used aerial photographs and satellite imagery to
   estimate a 91- to 119-m upslope shift in the upper limits of the NBE
   from 1962 to 2005. The upward shift is consistent with regional climatic
   change during the same period; interpolating climate data to the NBE
   showed a 1.1 degrees C increase in annual temperature, which would
   predict a 208-m upslope movement of the ecotone, along with a 34%
   increase in precipitation. The rapid upward movement of the NBE
   indicates. little inertia to climatically induced range shifts in
   montane forests; the upslope shift may have been accelerated by high
   turnover in canopy trees that provided opportunities for ingrowth of
   lower elevation species. Our results indicate that high-elevation
   forests may be jeopardized by climate change sooner than anticipated.

   remain as refugia. Thus, information on them is expected to contribute
   to conservation of biodiversity in coastal areas affected by climate
   change. To document the deep-growing Zostera caulescens in relation to
   the light environment, field surveys were conducted in coastal waters of
   the central area along the Japan Sea coast of Honshu, Japan, and then
   the relationship between the light environment and seagrass depth limit
   was examined. In the coastal waters of Sado Island and Noto Peninsula,
   the presence of deep coastal communities of Z. caulescens was confirmed
   in the depth range of 20-25 m. Biomass and shoot density for Z.
   caulescens, ranging 34.1-51.3 g DW m(-2) and 83-112 shoots m(-2), were
   recorded at a depth of 20 m in Ryotsu Bay, Sado Island. For the genus
   Zostera including the deep-growing Z. caulescens, the relation between
   the extinction coefficient and seagrass depth limit was described by the
   fitted regression equation. The minimum light requirement of the
   deep-growing Z. caulescens was markedly lower than that of the
   shallow-growing Zostera marina.

AB Geographic patterns in leaf stoichiometry reflect plant adaptations to
   environments. Leaf stoichiometry variations along environmental
   gradients have been extensively studied among terrestrial plants, but
   little has been known about intraspecific leaf stoichiometry, especially
   for wetland plants. Here we analyzed the dataset of leaf N and P of a
   cosmopolitan wetland species, Phragmites australis, and environmental
   (geographic, climate and soil) variables from literature and field
   investigation in natural wetlands distributed in three climatic regions
   (subtropical, temperate and highland) across China. We found no clear
   geographic patterns in leaf nutrients of P. australis across China,
   except for leaf N: P ratio increasing with altitude. Leaf N and N:P
   decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT), and leaf N and P were
   closely related to soil pH, C:N ratio and available P. Redundancy
   analysis showed that climate and soil variables explained 62.1% of total
   variation in leaf N, P and N: P. Furthermore, leaf N in temperate region
   and leaf P in subtropical region increased with soil available P, while
   leaf N: P in subtropical region decreased with soil pH. These patterns
   in P. australis different from terrestrial plants might imply that
   changes in climate and soil properties can exert divergent effects on
   wetland and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB In a changing environment the ability to adjust physiological functions
   to new conditions might be especially valuable for long-living
   ectothermic animals such as ants. With a simple method for estimating
   critical thermal minima of Myrmica ants we assessed variation of the
   minima and their response to lowered temperature. At a cooling rate of
   about 1 degrees C per minute the ants first displayed knock-down (at
   temperatures 1.5 to -0.2 degrees C) and only later immobilized
   completely (at -1.3 to -3.1 degrees C). Pre-chilling of ants at 5
   degrees C for 1 h lowered the parameters significantly but not greatly
   (about 0.9 degrees C). Constant laboratory conditions (20 degrees C)
   raised the knock-down temperature and tended to lower the temperature of
   immobilization. In the same manner the two parameters changed in field
   conditions in June, but no significant change occurred through August
   and until the end of study season in mid-September. When populations
   from different geographic localities were compared, populations from the
   north showed lower knock-down temperatures. The magnitude of these
   apparently genetic differences among populations was comparable to the
   magnitude of plastic changes that occurred either naturally, or in
   experiments, or in laboratory culture. The little plasticity and low
   geographic variation of the critical thermal minima may indicate that
   the ability of the ants to withstand cold events and populate varying
   climates bases mainly on the protective properties of nesting substrate.

AB A specific mechanism for the intracellular translocation of
   nonvesicle-associated proteins is proposed. This movement machinery is
   based on the assumption that the cytoskeleton represents an
   interconnected network of filamentous macromolecules, which extends over
   the entire cytoplasm, Diffusion along the filaments provides an
   efficient way for movement and with this, for signal transduction,
   between various intracellular compartments. We calculate the First
   Passage Time (FPT), the average time it takes a signaling molecule,
   diffusing along the cytoskeleton, to arrive from the cell surface to the
   nucleus for the first time. We compare our results with the FPT of free
   diffusion and of diffusion in the permeating cytoplasm, The latter is
   hindered by intracellular organelles and the cytoskeleton itself. We
   find that for filament concentrations even below physiological values,
   the FPT along cytoskeletal filaments concierges to that for free
   diffusion. When filaments are considered as obstacles, the FPT grows
   steadily with filament concentration. At realistic filament
   concentrations the FPT is insensitive to local modifications in the
   cytoskeletal network, including bundle formation. We conclude that
   diffusion along cytoskeletal tracks is a reliable alternative to other
   established ways of intracellular trafficking and signaling, and
   therefore provides an additional level of cell function regulation.

AB The debate about behavioral thermoregulation inside reptile eggs centers
   on the frequency (and hence, biological significance) of the phenomenon,
   not about its validity. Both sides of the debate agree that large eggs
   in shallow nests laid in sun-exposed soil will experience clines in mean
   temperature and (especially) diel thermal variance; that embryos in the
   middle phase of development have the ability to reposition themselves,
   and room to do so; and that small changes in developmental temperatures
   can influence offspring fitness. Equally, all protagonists agree that
   thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that
   embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in
   development. Based on an array of other fitness-enhancing behaviors
   exhibited by tetrapod embryos, and general principles for recognizing
   adaptation, we conclude that behavioral thermoregulation inside the egg
   likely is adaptive in some but not all reptile species. We identify
   productive directions for empirical research to resolve points of
   contention.

   thermal adaptations of Drosophila nasuta and Drosophila immigrans with
   seasonal as well as geographical changes in the relative abundance. In
   D. immigrans, cold resistance and egg-to-adult viability after a
   cold-shock have shown a positive dine with latitude, whereas no such
   clinal patterns were evident for heat resistance as well as egg-to-adult
   viability after heat stress. In contrast, basal heat tolerance and
   egg-to-adult viability after a heat-shock increased towards the equator
   i.e. from north to south in D. nasuta. Further, we also found
   species-specific divergence in seasonal climatic selection responses for
   heat as well as cold resistance i.e. warmer and higher humidity
   conditions of the rainy season have evidenced similar to 2-fold higher
   heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but lower temperature as well as lower
   humidity conditions of the autumn significantly increased (similar to
   3-fold) cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Geographical variations were
   significant for the absolute and relative hardening capacity for cold
   tolerance in D. immigrans, but for heat resistance of D. nasuta. Results
   of multiple regression analysis of changes in thermal tolerance level in
   latitudinal populations as a simultaneous function of climatic variables
   ( T-ave and RH) have shown that average yearly relative humidity levels
   significantly affect heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but both T-ave and RH
   contribute to changes in the cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Thus, our
   results suggest that climatic selection responses for basal and hardened
   thermo-tolerance levels affect relative abundance of D. nasuta and D.
   immigrans across a latitudinal transect as well as seasons. (C) 2013

AB During most of the year, the wolf spider Pardoset lapidicina Emerton
   1885 occupies tidal cobble beaches surrounding Narragansett Bay, RI,
   USA. but in late autumn part of the population moves into adjacent
   forest litter to overwinter. We monitored these movements with drift
   fences and pitfall traps from 1996-1999 and evaluated the possible roles
   of ambient temperature, rainfall, humidity and storm events. We tested
   substrate choice over the season as a proxy for migratory tendency, both
   in the laboratory and the field, focusing on the roles of temperature
   and photoperiod, The timing of peak migration differed among years (S.D.
   = 15.5 d). Minimum weekly temperature, weekly rainfall, percent relative
   humidity and storm events did not explain the variation in migratory
   times. However, significantly more spiders migrated during weeks with
   below-freezing temperatures than in weeks without them. Leaf litter,
   which has less variable temperatures than beach cobble. may provide a
   refuge from extreme temperatures during winter. Spiders maintained at
   cold temperatures in laboratory experiments chose leaves over beach
   cobble significantly more often than did those in warm temperatures. The
   time of year that spiders were collected also influenced their
   probability of choosing leaf substrate in the laboratory. Photoperiod.
   on the other hand, did not significantly influence substrate preference.
   This study helps to uncover how environmental cues influence seasonal
   movements across a habitat boundary.

AB The coupling between the depolymerization of microtubules (MTs) and the
   motion of the Dam1 ring complex is now thought to play an important role
   in the generation of forces during mitosis. Our current understanding of
   this motion is based on a number of detailed computational models.
   Although these models realize possible mechanisms for force
   transduction, they can be extended by variation of any of a large number
   of poorly measured parameters and there is no clear strategy for
   determining how they might be distinguished experimentally. Here we seek
   to identify and analyze two distinct mechanisms present in the
   computational models. In the first, the splayed protofilaments at the
   end of the depolymerizing MT physically prevent the Dam1 ring from
   falling off the end, and in the other, an attractive binding secures the
   ring to the microtubule. Based on this analysis, we discuss how to
   distinguish between competing models that seek to explain how the Dam1
   ring stays on the MT. We propose novel experimental approaches that
   could resolve these models for the first time, either by changing the
   diffusion constant of the Dam1 ring (e.g., by tethering a long polymer
   to it) or by using a time-varying load.

AB Porbeagles throughout the North Atlantic have experienced severe
   population decline through overfishing, with the northeastern population
   listed as critically endangered. Management of this population is
   constrained by the paucity of data on porbeagle population structure,
   distribution and behaviour in this region. Here we use a long-term (47
   year) Irish capture-mark-recapture dataset to investigate the population
   structure, spatial distribution and seasonal movements of this species.
   From 1970-2017, a total of 268 sharks (9 recaptures) were ID tagged,
   with most individuals likely being juvenile based on length at maturity
   estimates (mean total length = 143.9 cm, SD = 35.4). Almost all captures
   were recorded at three distinct locations near angling hubs along the
   south, west and north coasts with catches peaking in August. Long-term
   trends in capture date indicated a shift towards earlier capture dates
   in the northern site (n = 153). Our findings suggest Irish waters may
   act as a persistent summer aggregation site for juveniles, which show
   evidence for seasonal site fidelity, returning to nearby locations
   between years. These findings demonstrate the utility of such
   programmes, which can be implemented, with minimal expense by engaging
   with the angling sector, to elucidate the population structure and
   distribution of wide-ranging fish species.

AB Although it has been believed that wild-type plants are capable of
   protecting photosystem I (PSI) under high light, our previous study
   indicates that PSI is sensitive to high light in the shade-established
   tree species Psychotria rubra. However, the underlying physiological
   mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of electron
   transfer from PSII to PSI and PSI redox state in PSI photoinhibition in
   P. rubra by treatments with lincomycin (Lin), diuron (DCMU), and methyl
   viologen (MV). After exposure to 2000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) for 2
   h, PSI activity decreased by 35, 29, 3, and 49 % in samples treated with
   H2O, Lin, DCMU, and MV, respectively. Meanwhile, the MV-treated samples
   showed higher P700 oxidation ratio than the H2O-treated samples,
   suggesting the PSI photoinhibition under high light was accompanied by
   high levels of P700 oxidation ratio. PSI photoinhibition was alleviated
   in the DCMU-treated samples but was accelerated in the MV-treated
   samples, suggesting that PSI photoinhibition in P. rubra was mainly
   controlled by electron transfer from PSII to PSI. Taking together, PSI
   photoinhibition is more related to electron transfer from PSII to PSI
   rather than PSI redox state in P. rubra, which is different from the
   mechanisms of PSI photoinhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana and cucumber.

AB We pursue a systematic statistical mechanics study of finite smectic
   stacks of semiflexible manifolds bounded by interfaces under tension. We
   address, by analytic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, the
   effects of the surface tension on smectic interlayer distances. We use
   our theoretical results to elucidate the so called vapor pressure
   paradox (VPP) in multilamellar membrane phases and explain the
   experiments of Katsaras [Biophys. J. 73, 2924 (1997); 75, 2157 (1998)].
   We show that the effects of the interfacial tension are substantially
   weaker than suggested by the previous theoretical discussion of the VPP
   effects [R. Podgornik and V. A. Parsegian, Biophys. J. 72, 942 (1997)].
   By consistently taking into account the discrete, layered character of
   smectic liquid crystals, and anharmonic phonon effects, we show that the
   essence of VPP effects is in spatially nonuniform thermal expansion of
   smectic interlayer separations. We find that the average period of the
   whole finite stack can be both smaller (ordinary VPP effect at high
   enough interfacial tensions) or bigger (a reverse VPP effect at low
   interfacial tensions, overlooked in previous studies), relative to the
   average period of the corresponding infinite smectic stack. Looking at
   stacks from outside, these two effects show up as if there is an
   attractive (for the ordinary VPP effect), or repulsive (for the reverse
   VPP effect) pseudo-Casimir force acting between the two stack
   interfaces. We show however that the physics of VPP effects is obscured
   by schematically invoking Casimir-like forces. Rather, the ordinary and
   the reverse VPP effects are to be both characterized as thermomechanical
   anharmonic effects caused by a spatially nonuniform thermal expansion of
   smectic interlayer distances. Interlayer distances close to stack
   surfaces expand less (more) for the ordinary (reverse) VPP effect than
   those deep in the stack. The reverse VPP prevails at low interfacial
   tensions, simply because the membrane at the top of the stack is more
   free to fluctuate than membranes in the bulk. By increasing interfacial
   tension above a threshold value, fluctuations of the membrane at the
   stack top become suppressed, and the ordinary VPP effect prevails. In
   this study, we demonstrate that finite-size VPP effects in a strongly
   entropic system, such as the sterically stabilized lamellar phases, can
   be described quantitatively well by a simple analytic approach.

AB Phenotypic plasticity, if adaptive, may allow species to counter the
   detrimental effects of extreme conditions, but the infrequent occurrence
   of extreme environments and/or their restriction to low-quality habitats
   within a species range means that they exert little direct selection on
   reaction norms. Plasticity could, therefore, be maladaptive under
   extreme environments, unless genetic correlations are strong between
   extreme and non-extreme environmental states, and the optimum phenotype
   changes smoothly with the environment. Empirical evidence suggests that
   populations and species from more variable environments show higher
   levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes, but genetic
   variance for plastic responses can also be low, and genetic variation
   may not be expressed for some classes of traits under extreme
   conditions. Much of the empirical literature on plastic responses to
   extremes has not yet been linked to ecologically relevant conditions,
   such as asymmetrical fluctuations in the case of temperature extremes.
   Nevertheless, evolved plastic responses are likely to be important for
   natural and agricultural species increasingly exposed to climate
   extremes, and there is an urgent need to collect empirical information
   and link this to model predictions.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and
   evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.

AB In north-western North America, the so-called divergence problem (DP) is
   expressed in tree ring width (RW) as an unstable temperature signal in
   recent decades. Maximum latewood density (MXD), from the same region,
   shows minimal evidence of DP. While MXD is a superior proxy for summer
   temperatures, there are very few long MXD records from North America.
   Latewood blue intensity (LWB) measures similar wood properties as MXD,
   expresses a similar climate response, is much cheaper to generate and
   thereby could provide the means to profoundly expand the extant network
   of temperature sensitive tree-ring (TR) chronologies in North America.
   In this study, LWB is measured from 17 white spruce sites (Picea glauca)
   in south-western Yukon to test whether LWB is immune to the temporal
   calibration instabilities observed in RW. A number of detrending
   methodologies are examined. The strongest calibration results for both
   RW and LWB are consistently returned using age-dependent spline (ADS)
   detrending within the signal-free (SF) framework. RW data calibrate best
   with June-July maximum temperatures (Tmax), explaining up to 28%
   variance, but all models fail validation and residual analysis. In
   comparison, LWB calibrates strongly (explaining 43-51% of May-August
   Tmax) and validates well. The reconstruction extends to 1337 CE, but
   uncertainties increase substantially before the early 17th century
   because of low replication. RW-, MXD- and LWB-based summer temperature
   reconstructions from the Gulf of Alaska, the Wrangell Mountains and
   Northern Alaska display good agreement at multi-decadal and higher
   frequencies, but the Yukon LWB reconstruction appears potentially
   limited in its expression of centennial-scale variation. While LWB
   improves dendroclimatic calibration, future work must focus on suitably
   preserved sub-fossil material to increase replication prior to 1650 CE.

AB British Columbia (BC), Canada is experiencing a severe mountain pine
   beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic extending over an area
   of 135,000 km(2). The widespread mortality of lodgepole pine (Pinus
   contorta var. latifolia) caused by the beetle has significant
   implications for BC's timber supply and Canada's carbon (C) budget. This
   study used the eddy-covariance technique to examine how the beetle is
   impacting the net ecosystem production (NEP) of two attacked lodgepole
   pine-dominated stands in the central interior of BC. MPB-06 is an
   83-year-old stand that was first attacked in 2006. At the start of 2007
   roughly 60% of the canopy had been attacked and by October 2008 only 21%
   of the trees remained healthy. MPB-03, a 110-year-old stand, had >95%
   pine canopy mortality as a result of a 2003 beetle attack, and also
   differed from MPB-06 in that it had a more developed secondary structure
   (consisting of tree seedlings and saplings and sub-canopy and canopy
   trees) that survived the beetle attack. Eddy-covariance measurements
   were also conducted in two stands near MPB-06 harvested in 2005 and 1997
   (CC-05 and CC-97) for approximately three-week periods each during the
   2007 growing season. MPB-06 had an annual NEP of -82 and -33 g C m(-2),
   while MPB-03 had an NEP of -56 and 4 g C m(-2) in 2007 and 2008,
   respectively. In the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons (May-September),
   MPB-06 was a sink of 12 and 52 g C m(-2), while MPB-03 was a sink of 17
   and 68 g C m(-2). respectively. The productivity at MPB-06 resulted from
   an increase in photosynthesis by the remaining healthy trees and
   understory vegetation, while at MPB-03 the secondary structure and
   understory vegetation showed a strong capacity to sequester C due to an
   opening up of the stand as a result of canopy mortality. Average daily
   values of NEP during the measurement periods at CC-97 and CC-05 were
   -0.37 and -0.87 g C m(-2), respectively, showing that even 10 years
   following harvesting, these stands are likely to remain growing season C
   sources. That MPB-06 and MPB-03 were growing season C sinks suggests
   that deferring the harvest of stands with significant levels of
   secondary structure could prevent MPB-attacked forested areas from
   becoming C sources over extended periods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Geographically widespread species that occupy varied thermal
   environments provide testable models for understanding the evolution of
   life-history responses to latitude. Studies that draw range-wide
   conclusions using descriptive data from populations in the core of a
   species' distribution can overlook meaningful inter-population
   variation. The Texas Horned Lizard (Phrynosomatidae: Phrynosoma
   cornutum) spans an extensive latitudinal distribution in North America
   and has been well studied in connection with life-history evolution, yet
   populations occupying the most northern and coldest areas within its
   range were absent from previous examinations. We tested genus-wide
   patterns and challenged species-specific findings on the evolution of
   the life-history strategy of P. cornutum using populations at the
   northern edge of its geographic range and comparative material from
   farther south. Traits in populations at the highest latitudes
   corroborated several patterns for the genus and species, including
   delayed reproduction and a trend towards smaller adult body size with
   increasing latitude. Novel in our study, however, was the finding of a
   comparative increase in clutch size among size-adjusted females in
   Kansas, indicating a reproductive response for greater fecundity at the
   northern edge of its geographic range. Furthermore, analyses adjusted
   for body size revealed that egg dimensions were constant across
   variation in clutch size, suggesting that there is not a strong
   relationship between egg size and egg number across latitude. We discuss
   the selective pressures that may have resulted in the diminution of
   adult body size coupled with greater fecundity that is unique to the
   northernmost populations of P. cornutum. Our findings highlight the type
   of insights into the study of life-history evolution that can be gained
   across Phrynosomatidae from the inclusion of populations representing
   latitudinal endpoints.
