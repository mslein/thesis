AB Pine latewood width, density, and stable carbon isotope ratios were
   measured at two sites, separated in altitude by 400 m, close to the
   forest limit on a south-facing slope in the western French Alps. The
   signal to noise ratio in the delta(13)C series from each site is higher
   than that of either of the growth proxies. When the sites are combined,
   the high-frequency climate signal in the delta(13)C series is enhanced,
   whereas in both the ring width and density series it is weakened.
   Because regional climate dominates over local site condition S,
   delta(13)C ratios from long pine chronologies will provide a better
   indicator of past climate than either ring widths or densities. At dry
   Alpine sites, delta(13)C values are controlled mainly by stomatal
   conductance, which is linked to summer moisture stress and thus
   antecedent precipitation.

AB Synopsis Metabolic cold adaptation is a pattern where ectotherms from
   cold, high-latitude, or - altitude habitats have higher metabolic rates
   than ectotherms from warmer habitats. When found, metabolic cold
   adaptation is often attributed to counter-gradient selection, wherein
   short, cool growing seasons select for a compensatory increase in growth
   rates and development times of ectotherms. Yet, ectotherms in
   high-latitude and - altitude environments face many challenges in
   addition to thermal and time constraints on lifecycles. In addition to
   short, cool growing seasons, high-latitude and - altitude environments
   are characterized by regular exposure to extreme low temperatures, which
   cause ectotherms to enter a transient state of immobility termed chill
   coma. The ability to resume activity quickly after chill coma increases
   with latitude and altitude in patterns consistent with local adaptation
   to cold conditions. We show that artificial selection for fast and slow
   chill coma recovery among lines of the fly Drosophila melanogaster also
   affects rates of respiratory metabolism. Cold-hardy fly lines, with fast
   recovery from chill coma, had higher respiratory metabolic rates than
   control lines, with cold-susceptible slow-recovering lines having the
   lowest metabolic rates. Fast chill coma recovery was also associated
   with higher respiratory metabolism in a set of lines derived from a
   natural population. Although their metabolic rates were higher than
   control lines, fast-recovering cold-hardy lines did not have faster
   growth rates or development times than control lines. This suggests that
   raised metabolic rates in high-latitude and - altitude species may be
   driven by adaptation to extreme low temperatures, illustrating the
   importance of moving "Beyond the Mean".

AB Smutgrass is an invasive warm-season perennial bunch-type grass native
   to tropical Asia. The two varieties of smutgrass prevalent in Florida
   are small smutgrass and giant smutgrass. Laboratory seed germination
   experiments were conducted on both smutgrass varieties to determine the
   effect of various environmental factors on germination and emergence.
   The average germination rate for both varieties was 88% at 30/20 C
   day/night temperatures. Seed germination for both varieties was greater
   under simulated temperature flux than at constant temperatures. Seed of
   both varieties germinated at four simulated Florida temperature fluxes
   (22/11, 27/15, 33/24, and 29/19 C day/night), although the germination
   of small smutgrass and giant smutgrass was reduced at 33/24 and 22/11 C,
   respectively. Germination of small and giant smutgrass under dark
   conditions was 27 and 53%, respectively. Both smutgrass varieties
   germinated over a wide range of pH values. Small and giant smutgrass
   germination was inhibited at water potentials below -0.2 MPa and when
   small smutgrass seed was placed below the soil surface. Emergence of
   giant smutgrass seed did not occur below 3 cm. Both smutgrass varieties
   germinated over a broad range of environmental conditions, indicating
   their capability of year-round germination; however, germination is only
   likely to occur under field conditions during the summer growing season
   when rainfall is prevalent. These results indicate that both species
   have the ability to germinate over a wide range of environmental
   conditions but that germination is inhibited by moisture stress and
   depth of burial. Considering that giant smutgrass prefers higher
   temperatures than small smutgrass, the advent of rainfall from June
   through September is conducive for germination. Practices that focus on
   the germination pattern of smutgrass could lead to better long-term
   management of smutgrass in Florida.

AB Climate change is affecting the phenology of seasonal events in Europe
   and the Northern Hemisphere, as shown by several studies of birds'
   timing of migration and reproduction. Here, we analyse the long-term
   (1982-2006) trends of first arrival dates of four long-distance
   migratory birds [ swift (Apus apus), nightingale ( Luscinia
   megarhynchos), barn swallow ( Hirundo rustica), and house martin
   (Delichon urbicum)] and first egg laying dates of two migrant ( swift,
   barn swallow) and two resident species [ starling ( Sturnus vulgaris),
   Italian sparrow ( Passer italiae)] at a study site in northern Italy. We
   also addressed the effects of local weather ( temperature and
   precipitation) and a climate index ( the North Atlantic Oscillation,
   NAO) on the interannual variability of phenological events. We found
   that the swift and the barn swallow significantly advanced both arrival
   and laying dates, whereas all other species did not show any significant
   temporal trend in either arrival or laying date. The earlier arrival of
   swifts was explained by increasing local temperatures in April, whereas
   this was not the case for arrival dates of swallows and first egg laying
   dates of both species. In addition, arrival dates of house martins were
   earlier following high NAO winters, while nightingale arrival was
   earlier when local spring rainfall was greater. Finally, Italian sparrow
   onset of reproduction was anticipated by greater spring rainfall, but
   delayed by high spring NAO anomalies, and swift's onset of reproduction
   was anticipated by abundant rainfall prior to reproduction. There were
   no significant temporal trends in the interval between onset of laying
   and arrival in either the swift or the barn swallow. Our findings
   therefore indicate that birds may show idiosyncratic responses to
   climate variability at different spatial scales, though some species may
   be adjusting their calendar to rapidly changing climatic conditions.

AB Dominant species of zooplankton community vary with latitude. Though
   China possesses a vast coastal area in northwestern Pacific, studies on
   the latitudinal dominant species gradient are rare. We collected
   zooplankton samples from Haizhou Bay (34.56A degrees-35.19A degrees N,
   119.51A degrees-120.30A degrees E), Yueqing Bay (28.14A degrees-28.38A
   degrees N, 121.10A degrees-121.21A degrees E) and Dongshan Bay (23.65A
   degrees-23.90A degrees N, 117.45A degrees-117.60A degrees E) in May 2012
   and May 2013 to preliminarily characterize the latitudinal dominant
   species distribution. All the samples were collected vertically using a
   0.505 mm mesh plankton net with 0.8 m in mouth diameter from bottom to
   surface. Calanus sinicus, Aidanosagitta crassa, Labidocera euchaeta,
   Zonosagitta nagae, Acartia pacifica and Paracalanus parvus were found to
   be dominant. C. sinicus was the most dominant species and the unique one
   occurred in all three bays. With latitude decreasing, both the abundance
   and proportion of C. sinicus declined sharply. Cluster analysis showed
   that the 6 dominant species could be divided into 3 groups, based on
   their occurrences in the three bays. Our results suggested that the
   distribution of dominant species along the coast of China has a
   significant latitudinal gradient. C. sinicus which widely distributes in
   the coastal water of the northwestern Pacific can well adapt to the
   temperature at different latitudes. The high abundance in Haizhou Bay
   indicated that C. sinicus was an exemplary warm-temperate species, and
   more commonly occurs in the north of China seas. The ecological
   characteristics of dominant species change from warm-temperate type in
   high-latitudinal bays to warm water type in low-latitudinal bays.

AB The physical limit with which a cell senses external ligand
   concentration corresponds to the perfect absorber, where all ligand
   particles are absorbed and overcounting of same ligand particles does
   not occur. Here, we analyze how the lateral diffusion of receptors on
   the cell membrane affects the accuracy of sensing ligand concentration.
   Specifically, we connect our modeling to neurotransmission in neural
   synapses where the diffusion of glutamate receptors is already known to
   refresh synaptic connections. We find that receptor diffusion indeed
   increases the accuracy of sensing for both the glutamate
   alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazole-Propionic Acid (AMPA) and
   N-Methyl-D-aspartic Acid (NMDA) receptor, although the NMDA receptor is
   overall much noisier. We propose that the difference in accuracy of
   sensing of the two receptors can be linked to their different roles in
   neurotransmission. Specifically, the high accuracy in sensing glutamate
   is essential for the AMPA receptor to start membrane depolarization,
   while the NMDA receptor is believed to work in a second stage as a
   coincidence detector, involved in long-term potentiation and memory.

AB Landings of North American Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over the past
   century show multidecadal patterns, which most recently characterize
   unprecedented declines in abundance. Stock size is compared with sea
   surface temperature (SST) data in the marine nurseries of post-smolt
   Atlantic salmon. A previously described correlation between stock
   abundance and winter SST conditions was again documented; however, of
   more relevance to the survival of salmon post-smolts, a correlation was
   also observed between abundance and spring SST in the Gulf of St.
   Lawrence. The relevance of the winter SST correlation was further
   investigated by considering winter conditions in the freshwater
   nurseries as a factor causing elevated overwintering mortality of
   pre-migrant parr. The salmon abundance time series was compared with air
   temperature and rainfall trends averaged over time and space. Air
   temperature and rainfall do not appear to be significant environmental
   variables in shaping salmon recruitment. The timing of smolt runs
   appears to be out of synchronization with ocean conditions in the
   post-smolt nursery areas. The relationship between marine and freshwater
   impacts may change with changing climate conditions. Persistent positive
   phase forcing in the North Atlantic Oscillation raises the concern that
   recent declines in Atlantic salmon are, in part, due to global climate
   change.

AB Many theoretical models predict when genetic evolution and phenotypic
   plasticity allow adaptation to changing environmental conditions. These
   models generally assume stabilizing selection around some optimal
   phenotype. We however often ignore how optimal phenotypes change with
   the environment, which limit our understanding of the adaptive value of
   phenotypic plasticity. Here, we propose an approach based on our
   knowledge of the causal relationships between climate, adaptive traits,
   and fitness to further these questions. This approach relies on a
   sensitivity analysis of the process-based model Phenofit, which
   mathematically formalizes these causal relationships, to predict fitness
   landscapes and optimal budburst dates along elevation gradients in three
   major European tree species. Variation in the overall shape of the
   fitness landscape and resulting directional selection gradients were
   found to be mainly driven by temperature variation. The optimal budburst
   date was delayed with elevation, while the range of dates allowing high
   fitness narrowed and the maximal fitness at the optimum decreased. We
   also found that the plasticity of the budburst date should allow
   tracking the spatial variation in the optimal date, but with variable
   mismatch depending on the species, ranging from negligible mismatch in
   fir, moderate in beech, to large in oak. Phenotypic plasticity would
   therefore be more adaptive in fir and beech than in oak. In all species,
   we predicted stronger directional selection for earlier budburst date at
   higher elevation. The weak selection on budburst date in fir should
   result in the evolution of negligible genetic divergence, while beech
   and oak would evolve counter-gradient variation, where genetic and
   environmental effects are in opposite directions. Our study suggests
   that theoretical models should consider how whole fitness landscapes
   change with the environment. The approach introduced here has the
   potential to be developed for other traits and species to explore how
   populations will adapt to climate change.

AB The within- and among-population variation in individual growth rate of
   brown trout Salmo trutta L. was studied in five small neighbouring
   streams (seven isolated populations) within a distance of 70 km in east
   Norway. Observed growth rate was only weakly correlated with predicted
   maximum growth rate based on laboratory models, and there was a
   significant interaction with site. A generalized linear model showed
   that growth rate was positively correlated with temperature, but also
   that growth rate decreased as the summer season progressed. This might
   indicate either a seasonal decline in food availability or appetite, or
   a change in energy allocation strategy. Growth rate decreased with
   increasing fish age, probably as an effect of sexual maturation of older
   fish, and differential allocation of protein and lipid among different
   size-groups of brown trout. After adjusting for variation in
   temperature, season, and fish mass, there was still significant
   among-site variation in growth rate. A significant part of this
   variation was due to variation in brown trout density and the presence
   or absence of Alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus. Growth rate decreased
   with increasing brown trout density, and was lower in the presence than
   in the absence of Alpine bullhead after correcting for variation in
   brown trout density. This last result may indicate the presence of
   interspecific competition. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British

AB The present study investigated the magnitude of diurnal variation in
   back squat and bench press using the MuscleLab linear encoder over three
   different loads and assessed the benefit of an active warm-up to
   establish whether diurnal variation could be negated. Ten
   resistance-trained males underwent (mean +/- SD: age 21.0 +/- 1.3 years,
   height 1.77 +/- 0.06 m, and body mass 82.8 +/- 14.9 kg) three sessions.
   These included control morning (M-E, 07:30 h) and evening (E, 17:30 h)
   sessions (5-min standardized warm-up at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer),
   and one further session consisting of an extended active warm-up morning
   trial (M-E, 07:30 h) until rectal temperature (T-rec) reached previously
   recorded resting evening levels (at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer). All
   sessions included handgrip, followed by a defined program of bench press
   (at 20, 40, and 60 kg) and back squat (at 30, 50, and 70 kg) exercises.
   A linear encoder was attached to an Olympic bar used for the exercises
   and average force (AF), peak velocity (PV), and time to peak velocity
   (tPV) were measured (MuscleLab software; MuscleLab Technology,
   Langesund, Norway) during the concentric phase of the movements. Values
   for T-rec, were higher in the E session compared to values in the M
   session (Delta 0.53 degrees C, P < 0.0005). Following the extended
   active warm-up in the morning (M-E), T-rec and T-m values were no
   different to the E values (P < 0.05). Values for T-rec were lower in the
   M compared to the E condition throughout (P < 0.05). There were
   time-ofday effects for hand grip with higher values of 6.49% for left (P
   = 0.05) and 4.61% for right hand (P = 0.002) in the E compared to the M.
   Daily variations were apparent for both bench press and back squat
   performance for AF (3.28% and 2.63%), PV (13.64% and 11.50%), and tPV
   (-16.97% and -14.12%, where a negative number indicates a decrease in
   the variable from morning to evening). There was a main effect for load
   (P < 0.0005) such that AF and PV values were larger at higher masses on
   the bar than lower ones and tPV was smaller at lower masses on the bar
   than at higher masses for both bench press and back squat. We
   established that increasing T-rec in the M-E values did not result in an
   increase of any measures related to bench press and back squat
   performance (P > 0.05) to increase from M to E levels. Therefore,
   MuscleLab linear encoder could detect meaningful differences between the
   morning and evening for all variables. However, the diurnal variation in
   bench press and back squat (measures of lower and upper body force and
   power output) is not explained by time-of-day oscillations in T-rec.

TI Modulation of Global Low-Frequency Motions Underlies Allosteric

AB Allostery is a fundamental process by which ligand binding to a protein
   alters its activity at a distinct site. There is growing evidence that
   allosteric cooperativity can be communicated by modulation of protein
   dynamics without conformational change. The mechanisms, however, for
   communicating dynamic fluctuations between sites are debated. We provide
   a foundational theory for how allostery can occur as a function of
   low-frequency dynamics without a change in structure. We have generated
   coarse-grained models that describe the protein backbone motions of the
   CRP/FNR family transcription factors, CAP of Escherichia coli and GlxR
   of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The latter we demonstrate as a new
   exemplar for allostery without conformation change. We observe that
   binding the first molecule of cAMP ligand is correlated with modulation
   of the global normal modes and negative cooperativity for binding the
   second cAMP ligand without a change in mean structure. The theory makes
   key experimental predictions that are tested through an analysis of
   variant proteins by structural biology and isothermal calorimetry.
   Quantifying allostery as a free energy landscape revealed a protein
   "design space'' that identified the inter-and intramolecular regulatory
   parameters that frame CRP/FNR family allostery. Furthermore, through
   analyzing CAP variants from diverse species, we demonstrate an
   evolutionary selection pressure to conserve residues crucial for
   allosteric control. This finding provides a link between the position of
   CRP/FNR transcription factors within the allosteric free energy
   landscapes and evolutionary selection pressures. Our study therefore
   reveals significant features of the mechanistic basis for allostery.
   Changes in low-frequency dynamics correlate with allosteric effects on
   ligand binding without the requirement for a defined spatial pathway. In
   addition to evolving suitable three-dimensional structures, CRP/FNR
   family transcription factors have been selected to occupy a dynamic
   space that fine-tunes biological activity and thus establishes the means
   to engineer allosteric mechanisms driven by low-frequency dynamics.

AB Internal and external factors contribute to resting core temperature and
   affect thermoregulation. Also, a robust circadian rhythm exists,
   implying that the body is in "heat-gain" or "heat-loss" modes at
   different times during the 24 h. Moreover, many variables associated
   with exercise, and the body's capacity for exercise, show circadian
   variation. All these factors contribute to circadian changes in
   thermoregulation during exercise. Attention is focused on responses at
   the onset of exercise, "ciitical temperature", and recovery after
   exercise. Practical implications of circadian changes in
   thermoregulation during exercise include ergogenic aids and
   inter-individual differences, including those due to gender, age and
   acclimatisation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological and methodological factors influence the upper thermal limits
   (UTL) of ectothermic animals, but most factors have been studied
   independently. Few studies have integrated variables, so our
   understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary.
   Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols
   (heating rates, Delta Ts) and biological factors (ontogeny and body
   mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus
   nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal
   Maximum (CTmax). The species displayed slightly different responses to
   Delta Ts: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CTmax
   increased at a fastest Delta T, the same response happened in P.
   nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate Delta Ts. Also, the CTmax of P.
   nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of Delta T,
   but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat
   tolerance at the slow Delta T. Finally, we detected small, synergic
   effects of body mass and Delta Ts on the CTmax of both species. In small
   B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass
   had a positive effect on CTmax but only at slow and moderate Delta Ts,
   probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was
   observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast Delta T, but this
   result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings
   contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in
   small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the
   physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is
   related to acute temperatures.

AB The response of coral-reef ecosystems to contemporary thermal stress may
   be in part a consequence of recent or historical sea-surface temperature
   (SST) variability. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether: (i)
   there was a relationship between the historical frequency of SST
   variability and stress experienced during the most recent thermal-stress
   events (in 1998 and 2005-2006) and (ii) coral reefs that historically
   experienced frequent thermal anomalies were less likely to experience
   coral bleaching during these recent thermal-stress events. Examination
   of nine detrended coral delta O-18 and Sr/Ca anomaly records revealed a
   high-(5.7-year) and low-frequency (>54-year) mode of SST variability.
   There was a positive relationship between the historical frequency of
   SST anomalies and recent thermal stress; sites historically dominated by
   the high-frequency mode experienced greater thermal stress than other
   sites during both events, and showed extensive coral bleaching in 1998.
   Nonetheless, in 2005-2006, corals at sites dominated by high-frequency
   variability showed reduced bleaching, despite experiencing high thermal
   stress. This bleaching resistance was most likely a consequence of rapid
   directional selection that followed the extreme thermal event of 1998.
   However, the benefits of regional resistance could come at the
   considerable cost of shifts in coral species composition.

AB Objective: To examine temperature in relation to stroke mortality in a
   multicity time series study in China.
   Methods: We obtained data on daily temperature and mortality from 8
   large cities in China. We used quasi-Poisson generalized additive models
   and distributed lag nonlinear models to estimate the accumulative
   effects of temperature on stroke mortality across multiple days,
   adjusting for long-term and seasonal trends, day of the week, air
   pollution, and relative humidity. We applied the Bayesian hierarchical
   model to pool city-specific effect estimates.
   Results: Both cold and hot temperatures were associated with increased
   risk of stroke mortality. The potential effect of cold temperature might
   last more than 2 weeks. The pooled relative risks of extreme cold (first
   percentile of temperature) and cold (10th percentile of temperature)
   temperatures over lags 0-14 days were 1.39 (95% posterior intervals [PI]
   1.18-1.64) and 1.11 (95% PI 1.06-1.17), compared with the 25th
   percentile of temperature. In contrast, the effect of hot temperature
   was more immediate. The relative risks of stroke mortality over lags 0-3
   days were 1.06 (95% PI 1.02-1.10) for extreme hot temperature (99th
   percentile of temperature) and 1.14 (95% PI 1.05-1.24) for hot
   temperature (90th percentile of temperature), compared with the 75th
   percentile of temperature.
   Conclusions: This study showed that both cold and hot temperatures were
   associated with increased risk of stroke mortality in China. Our
   findings may have important implications for stroke prevention in China.

   Southern California Bight, USA, Laser ablation inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) of individual statoliths indicated
   detectable levels of Mg, Mn, Sr, and Ba, with marginal levels of Cr and
   Pb. While these paralarvae showed considerable within-sample differences
   in elemental concentrations, there was significant between-site
   discrimination of natal (core) and early larval signatures for
   collection sites up to 100 km apart. In 2002 and 2003, levels of Ba and
   Sr in the statolith cores were significantly different among sites,
   suggesting differences in the natal environment or local maternal
   effects. Site specific differences in elemental signatures were also
   apparent for Mg and Mn in samples taken from outside the core in the
   early post-hatching period. These same portions of the statolith can be
   analyzed from adult squid collected on spawning grounds. We showed that
   concentrations of trace elements in the statolith cores of adults
   closely resembled the core signatures of squid paralarvae, which opens
   the possibility of identifying the source populations for stocks of this
   commercially important species.

   (Leiuperidae) from Chile by comparing two populations at different
   latitudes but similar altitude (Limari and Chaiten), and two populations
   at similar latitude but different altitudes (Rata and Laja). Body size
   was measured and age was estimated by skeletochronology applied to
   phalanges. In each population there was a positive relationship between
   body size and age, and growth decreased gradually after maturity. The
   longevity was estimated to be five years for females and males; age
   structures were similar between sexes. Pleurodema thou! showed
   intra-population variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism in growth
   patterns, age at sexual maturity, and size. Females were larger than
   males in the low altitude and latitude populations (Limari and Itata),
   but did not differ significantly at high altitude and latitude
   populations (Chaiten and Laja). In all populations, sexual maturity was
   reached at two years of age by both sexes except that some females at
   high altitude and latitude did not mature until three years of age. The
   growth coefficient, according to von Bertalanffy's model, was greater in
   females than in males from Chaiten, greater in males from Limari, and
   was similar between sexes in Itata and Laja. Pleurodema thaul
   populations from high latitude and altitude showed slower growth than
   populations from low latitude and altitude, but individuals achieved
   larger body size. The mean annual growth rate was greater in populations
   located at high altitude or latitude for males and females. These
   results allow inference of the responses of amphibians to changes in the
   environment, which is key for generating conservation strategies.

AB The role of climate variability in the ecology of freshwater fishes is

   available for examining how freshwater fish populations respond to
   climate variations. Here, I apply tree-ring techniques to incremental
   growth patterns in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lacepede)
   otoliths to explore relationships between annual bass growth and various
   climate metrics in the southeastern USA. Among six rivers and seven
   reservoirs in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, strong correlations
   between annual bass growth indices and climate were detected (73 of 96
   possible correlations were significant at alpha < 0.05). All but two
   ecosystems exhibited the following pattern: annual bass growth was
   significantly negatively correlated with annual precipitation metrics,
   and significantly positively correlated with annual temperature metrics.
   Based on multiple regressions, climate, on average, accounted for
   similar to 50% of variability (R-2) in bass growth, although these
   values ranged from 28% to 65% depending on the ecosystem. Furthermore,
   every population showed significant correlations with at least one of
   the following global climate factors: El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Arctic Oscillation
   (AO). Largemouth bass growth in the southeast is apparently influenced
   by climate in major ways. Fish ecologists and managers in the region
   should be aware of the strong links between annual climate conditions
   and annual fish growth.

AB Body size is an ecologically important variable in animals. The
   geographical size variation of most snakes and some lizards counters
   Bergmann's rule in that, among related taxa, the larger ones live at
   warmer latitudes. However, exceptions notwithstanding, and despite being
   ectothermic, turtles as a group tend to obey Bergmann's rule. We
   examined this idea in Testudo graeca, ranging from Morocco to Romania
   and to Iran with disputed systematics, both at the global scale (using
   literature) and within the focal area of Israel (using museum
   specimens). Both globally and locally, carapace length correlated with
   latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The scant data on
   reproduction fully support the hypothesis that Bergmann's rule enables
   larger clutches where the climate would limit repeated clutches. The
   sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was approached using two methodologies: (1)
   conventional', using globally literature data and locally museum samples
   and (2) innovated', using photographs of copulating tortoises from
   Israel and Turkey. By each methodology, SSD emerged as being male biased
   in the larger-bodied populations and female biased in the smaller-bodied
   populations, obeying Rensch's rule. Some observations support the
   hypothesis that the evolution of large males serves intermale combating.
   Finally, Rensch's rule was found to apply separately within Anatolia and
   within the Levant, possibly indicating that these populations are
   separate.

AB In plants, low temperature causes massive transcriptional changes, many
   of which are presumed to be involved in the process of cold acclimation.
   Given the diversity of developmental and environmental factors between
   experiments, it is surprising that their influence on the identification
   of cold-responsive genes is largely unknown. Asystematic investigation
   of genes responding to 1d of cold treatment revealed that diurnal- and
   circadian-regulated genes are responsible for the majority of the
   substantial variation between experiments. This is contrary to the
   widespread assumption that these effects are eliminated using paired
   diurnal controls. To identify the molecular basis for this variation, we
   performed targeted expression analyses of diurnal and circadian time
   courses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that, after a
   short initial cold response, in diurnal conditions cold reduces the
   amplitude of cycles for clock components and dampens or disrupts the
   cycles of output genes, while in continuous light all cycles become
   arrhythmic. This means that genes identified as cold-responsive are
   dependent on the time of day the experiment was performed and that a
   control at normal temperature will not correct for this effect, as was
   postulated up to now. Time of day also affects the number and strength
   of expression changes for a large number of transcription factors, and
   this likely further contributes to experimental differences. This
   reveals that interactions between cold and diurnal regulation are major
   factors in shaping the cold-responsive transcriptome and thus will be an
   important consideration in future experiments to dissect transcriptional
   regulatory networks controlling cold acclimation. In addition, our data
   revealed differential effects of cold on circadian output genes and a
   unique regulation of an oscillator component, suggesting that cold
   treatment could also be an important tool to probe circadian and diurnal
   regulatory mechanisms.

   (Vancouver, BC). Sea stars from both sites were exposed to salinities
   ranging 15-30 psu. Following a 24-h exposure, the osmolality, sodium
   concentrations, and chloride concentrations in the perivisceral fluid
   all varied directly with salinity and were very close to the treatment
   salinities in both the Bamfield and Vancouver sea stars. The righting
   response (measured as an activity coefficient) was salinity dependent,
   with the lowest activity levels at a salinity of 15 psu. Activity
   coefficients did not vary between the two source populations. Feeding
   rates on mussels were strongly salinity dependent, but the salinity
   pattern was population specific. Bamfield sea stars fed the most at 30
   psu, whereas Vancouver sea stars fed the most at 20 psu. High
   post-experimental mortalities were observed in Bamfield sea stars that
   had been exposed to a salinity of 15 psu; no such mortality was observed
   in Vancouver animals. This study provides evidence that the sea stars
   from the lower salinity environment had been able to acclimatize or
   adapt to low-salinity conditions. However, the results also suggest that
   there are limits to this tolerance, and that future changes in salinity
   may have important consequences for marine communities via alteration of
   keystone predation.

AB The relationships of altitude, host life cycle (annual or perennial) and
   photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4) with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) root
   colonization were analysed in 35 species of Andean grasses. The study
   area is located in north-western Argentina along altitudinal sites
   within the Puna biogeographical region. Twenty-one sites from 3320 to
   4314 m were sampled. Thirty-five grasses were collected, and the AM root
   colonization was quantified. We used multivariate analyses to test
   emerging patterns in these species by considering the plant traits and
   variables of AM colonization. Pearson's correlations were carried out to
   evaluate the specific relationships between some variables. Most grasses
   were associated with AM, but the colonization percentages were low in
   both C3 and C4 grasses. Nevertheless, the AM root colonization clearly
   decreased as the altitude increased. This distinctive pattern among
   different species was also observed between some of the populations of
   the same species sampled throughout the sites. An inverse relationship
   between altitude and AM colonization was found in this Southern
   Hemisphere Andean system. The effect of altitude on AM colonization
   seems to be more related to the grasses' photosynthetic pathway than to
   life cycles. This study represents the first report for this
   biogeographical region.

AB The organization of the cytoplasm is regulated by molecular motors,
   which transport organelles and other cargoes along cytoskeleton tracks.
   In this work, we use single particle tracking to study the in vivo
   regulation of the transport driven by myosin-V along actin filaments in
   Xenopus laevis melanophores. Melanophores have pigment organelles or
   melanosomes, which, in response to hormones, disperse in the cytoplasm
   or aggregate in the perinuclear region. We followed the motion of
   melanosomes in cells treated to depolymerize microtubules during
   aggregation and dispersion, focusing the analysis on the dynamics of
   these organelles in a time window not explored before to our knowledge.
   These data could not be explained by previous models that only consider
   active transport. We proposed a transport-diffusion model in which
   melanosomes may detach from actin tracks and reattach to nearby
   filaments to resume the active motion after a given time of diffusion.
   This model predicts that organelles spend similar to 70% and 10% of the
   total time in active transport during dispersion and aggregation,
   respectively. Our results suggest that the transport along actin
   filaments and the switching from actin to microtubule networks are
   regulated by changes in the diffusion time between periods of active
   motion driven by myosin-V.

AB Year-class strength of fish is often considered to be determined at the
   pelagic larval stage, but we show that year-class strength of cod on the
   Faroe Plateau seems to be determined later, at the 1- or 2-group stage.
   Adult cod (C), measured in terms of the catch per unit effort (cpue) of
   small longliners, move into nearshore nursery areas of juvenile cod when
   in poor condition and probably displace 1-year-old cod to deeper water,
   where they are cannibalized. In addition, the recruitment of 2-year-old
   cod, at least up to a certain level, is positively related to the total
   biomass (B) of older cod on the Faroe Plateau, which are present at
   about the same time as the recruitment event. This feature, which seems
   to be a new observation in terms of the recruitment dynamics of cod, is
   possibly related to enhanced foraging or a reduced predation risk. The
   recruitment of 2-year-old cod during the years 1984-2006 is described by
   aB/C + d (r(2) = 0.87), where a and d are fitted constants. The
   implications for stock assessment and management are discussed.

AB For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions,
   latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures
   (averages and extremes) is expected to shape the evolution of
   physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of
   phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create
   geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater
   thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that
   maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to
   more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a
   fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural
   selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally,
   understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological
   plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological
   conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge
   in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul.
   We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity,
   behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to
   acclimation at 10 and 20 degrees C. We monitored survival during three
   separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an
   information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between
   survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we
   found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being
   targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of
   selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models,
   survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when
   cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during
   the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with
   body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates
   were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design
   prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear
   selection).

AB Climate change impacts on fisheries will undoubtedly have socio-economic
   impacts on coastal communities and the seafood market. However, it is a
   challenge to integrate climate change information in a form that can be
   used efficiently by adaptation planners, policy makers, and fishery
   managers. In this study, we frame a climate change impact assessment
   using a geographical perspective based on the management units of the
   dominant fishery, in this case, American lobster in Nova Scotia, Canada.
   The information considered here includes economic dependence on the
   fishery, population size, diversity of the fishery revenue, status of
   harbor infrastructure, total replacement cost of each harbor, increased
   relative sea level and flooding, and the vulnerability of offshore
   lobster to ocean warming and changes in zooplankton composition and
   anticipatory changes in fishery productivity across management borders.
   Using two ocean models to provide multi-decadal scale projections of
   bottom temperature, changes in offshore lobster distribution are
   projected to have a neutral, or positive impact on the region as a
   whole. However, when lobster vulnerability is combined with climate
   change related vulnerabilities of coastal fishing communities, it is
   evident that adaptation planning is needed for long-term sustainability.
   This impact assessment provides both a framework and information for
   further in-depth analyses by climate change adaptation planners and
   fishery managers.

AB The body size of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is known to
   vary across both its latitudinal range and relatively short geographic
   distances. Here we consider how variation in platypus length and weight
   associates with environmental variables throughout the species' range.
   Based on data from over 800 individuals, a Bergmann's cline (increased
   body size in regions of lower temperature) was detected across the
   species latitudinal range. The opposite association, however, was
   present at smaller scales when comparing platypus body size and
   temperature within southern mainland Australia, or within an individual
   river basin. Temperature regimes alone clearly did not dictate body size
   in platypuses, although disentangling the effects of different climatic
   variables on body size variation was difficult because of correlations
   amongst variables. Nevertheless, within suitable platypus habitat in
   south-eastern Australia, areas of relatively lower rainfall and higher
   temperatures were typically associated with larger-bodied platypuses.
   The potential benefits to larger-bodied animals living under these
   conditions are explored, including consideration of variation in energy
   expenditure and food availability. Assuming these associations with
   environmental variables are biologically significant, a shift in
   platypus body size is anticipated in the future with predicted changes
   in climate.

   determining whether alien species show broader thermal tolerance limits
   and greater tolerance to climate warming than their indigenous
   counterparts. We found that, from the tropics to the sub-Antarctic,
   alien species have the broadest thermal tolerances and greatest
   tolerance to environmental warming. Both groups of species show little
   phenotypic plasticity or potential for evolutionary change in tolerance
   to high temperature. These trait differences between alien and

AB Both old and new information on the biology and ecology of Atlantic
   bluefin tuna have confronted scientists with research challenges:
   research needs to be connected to current stock-assessment and
   management issues. We review recent studies on habitat, migrations and
   population structure, stressing the importance of electronic tagging
   results in the modification of our perception of bluefin tuna population
   dynamics and behaviour. Additionally, we question, from both scientific
   and management perspectives, the usefulness of the classical stock
   concept and suggest other approaches, such as Clark's contingent and
   metapopulation theories. Current biological information confirms that a
   substantial amount of uncertainty still exists in the understanding of
   reproduction and growth. In particular, we focus on intriguing issues
   such as the difference in age-at-maturity between West Atlantic and
   Mediterranean bluefin tuna. Our description of Atlantic bluefin tuna
   fisheries places today's fishing patterns within the two millennium
   history of exploitation of this species: we discuss trap fisheries that
   existed between the 17th and the early 20th centuries; Atlantic
   fisheries during the 1950s and 1960s; and the consequences of the recent
   development of the sushi-sashimi market. Finally, we evaluate stock
   status and management issues since the early 1970s. While important
   uncertainties remain, when the fisheries history is confronted with
   evidence from biological and stock-assessment studies, results indicate
   that Atlantic bluefin tuna has been undergoing heavy overfishing for a
   decade. We conclude that the current exploitation of bluefin tuna has
   many biological and economic traits that have led several fish stocks to
   extreme depletion in the past.

AB The reproductive biology of the gregarious brittle star Ophiothrix
   fragilis is described using the gonad index (GI) and the maturity index
   (MI) in conjunction with the photoperiod and water temperature. The
   ophiuroid has a typical annual reproductive cycle going through five
   distinct reproductive stages. After a resting period during the winter
   season, the growth and maturation period begins in parallel with a rise
   in seawater temperature. Spawning takes place during summer after which
   the gonads regress and the next cycle begins. The rise in temperature
   seems to influence gonadal growth and more specifically the maturation
   period of the gametogenic cycle, the indices each attaining higher
   values earlier in 1999 than in 2000, temperature having reached a
   maximum a month earlier that year. Representation of the MI in polar
   coordinates shows a relatively homogenous population during the winter
   and spring season (resting and maturation periods respectively) while
   the summer season is more heterogeneous due to the presence of
   individuals in various reproductive stages. Elevated water temperatures
   (above 16degreesC), mechanical stress believed to be due to strong
   hydrodynamics and the release of gametes by conspecifics seem to induce
   spawning in males and females with the former being more sensitive to
   these cues.

AB Although the term environmental stress is used across multiple fields in
   biology, the inherent ambiguity associated with its definition has
   caused confusion when attempting to understand organismal responses to
   environmental change. Here I provide a brief summary of existing
   definitions of the term stress, and the related concepts of homeostasis
   and allostasis, and attempt to unify them to develop a general framework
   for understanding how organisms respond to environmental stressors. I
   suggest that viewing stressors as environmental changes that cause
   reductions in performance or fitness provides the broadest and most
   useful conception of the phenomenon of stress. I examine this framework
   in the context of animals that have evolved in highly variable
   environments, using the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, as a
   case study. Consistent with the extreme environmental variation that
   they experience in their salt marsh habitats, killifish have substantial
   capacity for both short-term resistance and long-term plasticity in the
   face of changing temperature, salinity and oxygenation. There is
   inter-population variation in the sensitivity of killifish to
   environmental stressors, and in their ability to acclimate, suggesting
   that local adaptation can shape the stress response even in organisms
   that are broadly tolerant and highly plastic. Whole-organism differences
   between populations in stressor sensitivity and phenotypic plasticity
   are reflected at the biochemical and molecular levels in killifish,
   emphasizing the integrative nature of the response to environmental
   stressors. Examination of this empirical example highlights the utility
   of using an evolutionary perspective on stressors, stress and stress
   responses.

AB In Lake Constance, Eurasian bream Abramis brama (L.) spawn in very
   shallow littoral areas by the beginning of May. They attach their
   adhesive eggs to pebble and cobble substratum at <40 cm depth.
   Increasing water levels before spawning inundate bare substratum to
   which bream eggs may attach better than to deeper substratum covered by
   epilithon. Consequently, the water level increase prior to spawning
   should determine the amount of pristine spawning substratum available to
   bream and thus influence their breeding success. In order to test this
   hypothesis, the influence of hydrology and climate on the abundance of
   age-0 bream was combined with the results from field investigations on
   the egg survival and abundance of age-0 bream. A strong positive
   correlation between the mean water level increase during the spawning
   season of bream (April-May) and the abundance of juvenile bream was
   found. In contrast, the absolute water level during spawning and during
   the nursery stage in summer, the cumulative temperature during the egg,
   larval and juvenile stages and two North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   indices did not affect the abundance of juvenile bream. The field
   investigations confirmed that bream eggs attach better to and have
   higher survival rates on bare substratum than on substratum with
   epilithon cover. Accordingly, eggs within a spawning habitat of bream
   were most abundant between 10 and 20 cm depth, where the epilithon cover
   was lower than at depths exceeding 30 cm. The results of this study
   confirm an adverse influence of epilithon cover on the attachment and
   subsequent survival of bream eggs and emphasize the importance of spring
   inundations for the successful breeding of the bream.

   frequencies at HSC70. However, as predicted by Bergmann's rule, we
   detected a strong latitudinal cline that accounted for 60% of the
   variance in body size (R2 = 0.598; P < 0.001). In contrast, body size
   did not significantly affect thermal tolerance. HSC70 showed no genetic
   differentiation among the populations, supporting our previous
   mitochondrial gene-based estimate of high gene flow during this snail's
   free-swimming larval stage. Given that L. keenae experiences panmixia
   along its species range, the observed size cline may be partially or
   entirely caused by a phenotypically plastic response to local thermal
   environments rather than by genetic divergence in body size among
   populations in response to locally optimizing natural selection. (C)

AB Production of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) is a key adaptation to acute
   heat stress and will be important in determining plant responses to
   climate change. Further, intraspecifc variation in Hsps, which will
   influence species-level response to global warming, has rarely been
   examined in naturally occurring plants. To understand intraspecific
   variation in plant Hsps and its relevance to global warming, we examined
   Hsp content and thermotolerance in five naturally occurring populations
   of Chenopodium album L. from contrasting thermal environments grown at
   low and high temperatures. As expected, Hsp accumulation varied between
   populations, but this was related more to habitat variability than to
   mean temperature. Unexpectedly, Hsp accumulation decreased with
   increasing variability of habitat temperatures. Hsp accumulation also
   decreased with increased experimental growth temperatures. Physiological
   thermotolerance was partitioned into basal and induced components. As
   with Hsps, induced thermotolerance decreased with increasing temperature
   variability. Thus, populations native to the more stressful habitats, or
   grown at higher temperatures, had lower Hsp levels and induced
   thermotolerance, suggesting a greater reliance on basal mechanisms for
   thermotolerance. These results suggest that future global climate change
   will differentially impact ecotypes within species, possibly by
   selecting for increased basal versus inducible thermotolerance.

AB The egg and larval stages of the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and haddock
   Melanogrammus aeglefinus populations on Georges Bank, northeastern USA,
   were sampled monthly from February through July in 1995 and January
   through June in 1996 to 1999 as part of the US GLOBEC Georges Bank
   program. The eggs were staged by means of microscopic examination.
   Larvae were aged by otolith increment analysis. Seasonally averaged
   rates of egg mortality were estimated for both species and ranged from
   9.9 to 20.4 % d(-1) for cod and 7.8 to 13.4 % d(-1) for haddock. From
   the results of a simple drift model, the interannual variability in egg
   mortality rate is believed to be due largely to wind-driven transport
   off the southern side of the bank. The estimated number of hatched eggs
   is strongly correlated with the subsequent recruitment for both the
   Atlantic cod and haddock stocks. Mortality during the early larval
   period was estimated for 10 d cohorts within each year, based on the
   decrease in abundance from egg hatching to the first sampling of the
   cohort on a survey, when the larvae were on average about 15 d old. For
   both species, these rates were slowly varying between cohorts within a
   season, but showed large variation between years. For the 1995 to 1996
   period, the annual average mortality rate was about 6.3% d(-1) for cod
   and 10. 1 % d(-1) for haddock, whereas in 1998 to 1999 the values were
   3.9 % d(-1) for cod and 5.4 % d(-1) for haddock. The lower mortality
   rates in 1998 to 1999 are believed to be due to higher prey abundance
   for the larvae in those years. From the larval stage to stock
   recruitment, haddock appeared to have a survival rate (recruits per
   larvae) 3 times higher than that for Atlantic cod.

AB The effect of temperature variations on the pancreatic beta-cell
   activity and the role of different model compartments in temperature
   sensing have been investigated using a computational modeling approach.
   The results of our study show that temperature variations by several
   degrees can change the dynamical states of the beta-cell system. In
   addition, temperature variations can alter the characteristic features
   of the membrane voltage, which correlates with insulin secretion.
   Simulation results show that the ion channels such as the L-type
   calcium, the hERG potassium, sodium channels and the glycolysis pathway
   are the possible sites for sensing temperature variation. Results
   indicate that for a small temperature change, even though the frequency
   and amplitude of electrical activity are altered, the area under the
   membrane potential curve remains almost unchanged, which implies the
   existence of a thermoregulatory mechanism for preserving the amount of
   insulin secretion. Furthermore, the computational analysis shows that
   the beta-cell electrical activity exhibits a bursting pattern in
   physiological temperature (37 degrees C) while in vitro studies reported
   almost the spiking activity at lower temperatures. Since
   hormone-secreting systems work more efficient in bursting mode, we
   propose that the pancreatic beta-cell works better in the physiological
   temperature compared with the reference temperature (33 degrees C).

AB Previous in vitro experiments indicated that chloroplast small
   heat-shock proteins (sHsp) could associate with thylakoids and protect
   PSII during heat and other stresses, possibly by stabilizing the
   O-2-evolving complex (OEC). However, in vivo evidence of sHsp protection
   of PSII is equivocal at present. Using previously characterized
   selection genotypes of Agrostis stolonifera Huds. that differ in
   thermotolerance and production of chloroplast sHsps, we show that both
   genotypes contain thylakoid-associating sHsps, but the heat-tolerant
   genotype, which produces an additional sHsp isoform not made by the
   sensitive genotype, produces a greater quantity of chloroplast and
   thylakoid sHsp. Following a pre-heat stress to induce sHsps, in vivo
   PSII function decreased less at high temperatures in the tolerant
   genotype. Differences in PSII thermotolerance in vivo were associated
   with increased thermotolerance of the OEC proteins and O-2-evolving
   function of PSII, and not with other PSII proteins or functions
   examined. In vivo cross-linking experiments indicated that a greater
   amount of sHsp associated with PSII proteins during heat stress in the
   tolerant genotype. PSII was the most thermosensitive component of
   photosynthetic electron transport, and no differences between genotypes
   in the thermotolerance of other electron transport components were
   observed. These results indicate that in vivo chloroplast sHsps can
   protect O-2 evolution and the OEC proteins of PSII during heat stress.

AB We investigated the relationship between large-scale climate variability
   (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO), continental shelf hydrography,
   and year-class strength of yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) in
   the Middle Atlantic Bight. Using long-term environmental time series
   (1963-98), dominant winter NAO phase in the northeast region of the
   United States was correlated with local air temperature records from
   Block Island, Rhode Island (December-March). Air temperature also
   influenced the characteristics of a pool of remnant winter cold water on
   the continental shelf, such that negative NAO winters produced a
   colder-than-average summer cold pool, and vice versa. Smoothed data sets
   of L. ferruginea recruitment over the 36-yr period (using Southern New
   England VPA and hindcast data) were highly correlated with the NAO and
   air temperature, highlighting the influence of multi-year variability.
   Although less robust, the relationship with the NAO remained significant
   after removing equal-but-opposite long-term linear trends from the
   series. Surprisingly, recruitment and cold pool bottom temperature were
   only marginally correlated. Data from independent 2-m beam trawl and
   submersible sampling in the region (1994, 1996-2000) indicated a strong
   relationship between the abundance of recent settlers and cold pool
   temperature; however, this pattern was often modified by subsequent
   changes in cold pool stratification (fall overturn). These results
   underscore the dynamic role thermal habitats play in the lives of early
   stage benthic fishes. For yellowtail flounder, the generation of
   recruitment variability represents one endpoint of a complex interaction
   between large-scale phenomena (climate) and more localized, event-scale
   features (cold pool).

AB Anthropogenic climate change is already impacting ecological systems.
   Understanding how organisms respond to weather (short-term) and climate
   (long-term) variability, and the population and ecosystem-wide
   consequences of climate change, is a research priority. The appropriate
   use of information on past and potential future weather and climate
   conditions is crucial for such research, but uncertainties and biases in
   this information are seldom given full consideration, with important
   consequences for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on
   the conservation of biodiversity. Here, we highlight three important
   neglected issues pertaining to the major applications of weather and
   climate information in ecological and biogeographical studies. These are
   as follows: (1) the uncertainty associated with historical weather and
   climate information; (2) the selection of ensembles of simulated future
   climate conditions derived from general circulation models (GCM); and
   (3) the uncertainty and assumptions associated with downscaling GCM
   simulations to ecologically relevant spatial scales. Broadly, in order
   to improve the use of weather and climate information in ecological
   studies, we propose that ecologists must: (1) use weather and climate
   products that are appropriate for their intended purpose; (2) explore
   the consequences of uncertainty in these products for ecological
   conclusions; and (3) seek greater integration of ecological and climate
   research to create products that reflect both the requirements of
   ecologists and the limits of climatology. This will enable more
   effective research into the likely responses of ecological systems to
   future climate change.

AB Climatic variation has been invoked as an explanation of population
   dynamics for a variety of taxa. Much work investigating the link between
   climatic forcings and population fluctuation uses single-taxon case
   studies. Here, we conduct comparative analyses of a multi-decadal
   dataset describing population dynamics of 50 co-occurring butterfly
   species at 10 sites in Northern California. Specifically, we explore the
   potential commonality of response to weather among species that
   encompass a gradient of population dynamics via a hierarchical Bayesian
   modelling framework. Results of this analysis demonstrate that certain
   weather conditions impact volatile, or irruptive, species differently as
   compared with relatively stable species. Notably, precipitation-related
   variables, including indices of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, have a
   more pronounced impact on the most volatile species. We hypothesize that
   these variables influence vegetation resource availability, and thus
   indirectly influence population dynamics of volatile taxa. As one of the
   first studies to show a common influence of weather among taxa with
   similar population dynamics, the results presented here suggest new
   lines of research in the field of biotic-abiotic interactions.

AB The main aim of this study was to compare the thermal responses and the
   responses of cognitive and motor functions to intermittent cold stress
   between males and females. The intermittent cold stress continued until
   rectal temperature (T-RE) reached 35.5 degrees C or for a maximum of 170
   min. Thermal response and motor and cognitive performance were
   monitored. During intermittent cold stress, body temperature variables
   decreased in all subjects (P < 0.001) and did not differ between sexes.
   The presence of fast and slow cooling types for participants with
   similar effect on physiological variables were observed; thus the
   different rate coolers were grouped together and were attributed only
   sex specific responses. Overall, TRE cooling rate and cold strain index
   did not differ between sexes. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)
   decreased after intermittent cold exposure only in males (P < 0.001),
   whereas changes in muscle electromyography (EMG) activity did not differ
   between sexes. The effects of intermittent cold stress on electrically
   evoked muscle properties, spinal (H-reflex), and supraspinal (V-waves)
   reflexes did not differ between sexes. Intermittent cold-induced
   cognitive perturbation of attention and memory task performance was
   greater in males (P < 0.05). Contrary to our expectations, the results
   of the present study indicated that males and females experience similar
   thermal stress induced by intermittent whole-body cold immersion.
   Although no sex-specific differences were observed in muscle EMG
   activity, involuntary muscle properties, spinal and supraspinal
   reflexes, some of the sex differences observed (e.g., lower isometric
   MVC and greater cognitive perturbation in males) support the view of
   sex-specific physiological responses to core temperature decrease. (C)

AB This paper reports the results of long-term research carried out in the
   deep southern subalpine lakes (DSL: Maggiore, Lugano, Como, Iseo and
   Garda). The measurements performed since the 1970s at the time of the
   maximum overturn documented an increase of water temperature around 0.0
   12-0.028 degrees C yr(-1), closely resembling the warming rate found in
   other lakes in Europe and North America.. The DSL showed an increase of
   total phosphorus after the 1960s and a complete recovery after the 1990s
   of Lake Maggiore, which reached mean values of TP close to those of the
   pristine conditions (<10 mu g P l(-1)). Present TP concentrations in the
   other lakes are above 100 mu g P l(-1) (Lugano), 30-40 mu g P l(-1)
   (Como), 50-60 mu g P l(-1) (Iseo) and c. 20 mu g P l(-1) (Garda), with
   only Lake Garda showing a clear tendency to increasing P-concentrations
   in recent years. The higher trophic status of lakes Lugano and Iseo has
   favoured hypolinmetic anoxia due to meromixis since the 1960s and the
   1990s, respectively, from which there was a partial recovery in 2005.
   Monthly samplings carried out in the last decades showed a strong
   coupling between long-term variation in algal nutrients and
   phytoplankton. On a shorter temporal scale, a significant relationship
   between the extent of water mixing during the spring months and the
   replenishment of nutrients and algal biomass in the growing season has
   also been verified in lakes Iseo, Garda and Lugano.

AB Diatom assemblages preserved in continental sedimentary successions of
   the southern Pampas (Argentina) can provide useful indicators of past
   environmental changes. Ecological data, however, are scarce. In order to
   provide modern data for diatom-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions,
   sediments from shallow lakes and streams of the region were analyzed. A
   total of 131 diatom species were identified. Canonical correspondence
   analysis was used to identify the physical and chemical environmental
   parameters that best explained the distribution of taxa. Cocconeis
   placentula, Hippodonta hungarica, Navicula veneta, Cyclotella
   meneghiniana and Nitzschia amphibia were the most widely extended
   species. The highest percentage variance in diatom data was explained by
   conductivity and nutrient concentrations. Diatom assemblage composition
   was more variable in shallow lakes than in streams, which is in
   agreement with the different hydrological and geomorphological
   characteristics of these environments. The results obtained in the
   present work provide useful analogues for paleoenvironmental
   reconstructions of water bodies in southern Pampas.

AB Bufo spinulosus has a wide and fragmented distribution range in Chile

   Genetic variation was estimated using RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic
   DNA) markers in 10 populations from northern and central Chile.
   Morphometric and genetic information was analyzed as a function of
   geographical origin. The correlation between genetic and morphometric
   differentiation was analyzed by the Mantel test. An increase in body
   size as a function of latitude was observed. Specimens from El Tatio had
   the smallest body size and the greatest morphometric divergence. The
   AMOVA applied to genetic data indicated that 57.85 % of the variance is
   explained by interregional differences and that 30.12 % of the variance
   is found within populations. Low levels of within-regions genetic
   differentiation was observed in northern populations while higher levels
   of genetic differentiation was found in populations from central Chile.
   Mantel tests revealed a significant, positive correlation between
   genetic variation and geographic distance. When we excluded El Tatio
   population, Mantel test analyses showed significant correlations between
   morphological distance and genetic and geographic distances. We discuss
   whether water temperature could explain the morphological divergence
   observed in individuals from El Tatio.

AB Winterhardiness has three primary components: photoperiod (day length)
   sensitivity, vernalization response, and low temperature tolerance.
   Photoperiod and vernalization regulate the vegetative to reproductive
   phase transition, and photoperiod regulates expression of key
   vernalization genes. Using two barley mapping populations, we mapped six
   individual photoperiod response QTL and determined their positional
   relationship to the phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptor gene
   families and the vernalization regulatory genes HvBM5A, ZCCT-H, and
   HvVRT-2. Of the six photoreceptors mapped in the current study (HvPhyA

   to 2HL), only HvPhyC coincided with a photoperiod response QTL. We
   recently mapped the candidate genes for the 5HL VRN-H1 (HvBM5A) and 4HL
   VRN-H2 (ZCCT-H) loci, and in this study, we mapped HvVRT-2, the barley
   TaVRT-2 ortholog (a wheat flowering repressor regulated by vernalization
   and photoperiod) to 7HS. Each of these three vernalization genes is
   located in chromosome regions determining small photoperiod response QTL
   effects. HvBM5A and HvPhyC are closely linked on 5HL and therefore are
   currently both positional candidates for the same photoperiod effect.
   The coincidence of photoperiod-responsive vernalization genes with
   photoperiod QTL suggests vernalization genes should also be considered
   candidates for photoperiod effects.

AB We studied rectal body temperatures of house mice (Mus domesticus) that
   had been artificially selected for high voluntary wheel running.
   1. At generation 17, mice from the four replicate selected lines ran, on
   average, 2.5-times as many revolutions/day as did mice from the four
   random-bred control lines.
   2. During the day, repeatability of individual differences in body
   temperature measured 4 days apart was low; at night, repeatability was
   statistically significant across three time scales (1 day, 1 week, 2
   weeks).
   3. During the day, body temperatures of selected and control animals did
   not differ; at night, mice from selected lines had higher body
   temperatures. However, when amount of wheel running immediately prior to
   measurement was included as a covariate, the difference was no longer
   statistically significant.
   Higher body temperatures, associated with increased activity, might
   enhance locomotor abilities through Q10 effects, increase metabolic rate
   and food requirements, affect sleep patterns, and alter expression of
   heat-shock proteins. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>Partitioning soil respiration into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic
   (R-H) components is critical for understanding their differential
   responses to climate warming.
   Here, we used a deconvolution analysis to partition soil respiration in
   a pulse warming experiment. We first conducted a sensitivity analysis to
   determine which parameters can be identified by soil respiration data. A
   Markov chain Monte Carlo technique was then used to optimize those
   identifiable parameters in a terrestrial ecosystem model. Finally, the
   optimized parameters were employed to quantify R-A and R-H in a forward
   analysis.
   Our results displayed that more than one-half of parameters were
   constrained by daily soil respiration data. The optimized model
   simulation showed that warming stimulated R-H and had little effect on
   R-A in the first 2 months, but decreased both R-H and R-A during the
   remainder of the treatment and post-treatment years. Clipping of
   above-ground biomass stimulated the warming effect on R-H but not on
   R-A. Overall, warming decreased R-A and R-H significantly, by 28.9% and
   24.9%, respectively, during the treatment year and by 27.3% and 33.3%,
   respectively, during the post-treatment year, largely as a result of
   decreased canopy greenness and biomass.
   Lagged effects of climate anomalies on soil respiration and its
   components are important in assessing terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks
   to climate warming.

AB The Atlantic dipole phosphate utilization (ADPU) index, derived through
   statistical conversion of 20th century Atlantic basin subpolar sea
   surface temperatures, is used as a fingerprint of Atlantic meridional
   overturning circulation (AMOC) variability and as an indicator of global
   Meridional Overturing Circulation (MOC) variability. ADPU index
   correlations with differences in sea level anomalies (SLAs) between
   Canada and the UK and across the Isthmus of Panama demonstrate
   intrabasin and interbasin associations with MOC variability.
   Cross-correlation analyses of ADPU index, SLAs, and sardine (S) and
   anchovy (A) catch differences [S A] (normalized sardine catch minus
   normalized anchovy catch) confirm strong correlations between ADPU and
   [S A] off Japan, California, Peru and Southwest Africa (Benguela).
   Statistically significant cross correlations also exist between the ADPU
   index and SLAs for Japan, California, Peru and Benguela, and for SLAs
   and [S A] for Japan, California and Peru, but the short time-series
   lengths compared with the length of the multidecadal cycle limit the
   interpretation of the observed lead-lags. Though correlation is not
   causality, the correlation analyses developed here are useful in support
   of hypothesis generation. The proposed hypothesis to explain the
   observed small pelagic fishery synchronies asserts: (i) ocean bathymetry
   and continental distributions interact with multidecadal variations in
   MOC strength that occur along the conceptual global conveyor belt to
   generate changes in global oceanic planetary waves and mesoscale eddies
   that propagate through the world ocean; (ii) each small pelagic fishery
   region has a unique spatial relationship with pertinent oceanic
   planetary wave and mesoscale eddy source regions that affect the timing
   and strength of the waves and eddies that influence the nearby boundary
   current; (iii) synchronous changes or phasing among global fisheries
   depend on how and when MOC variability mediated by oceanic planetary
   waves and mesoscale eddies reaches each fishery region; (iv) oceanic
   planetary waves and/or mesoscale eddies influence the strength or
   meandering of the boundary current adjacent to a small pelagic fishery
   region to change local SLAs and environmental conditions to favour
   sardine or anchovy populations at different times.

AB High mountain ecosystems and their biota are governed by low-temperature
   conditions and thus can be used as indicators for climate warming
   impacts on natural ecosystems, provided that long-term data exist. We
   used data from the largest alpine to nival permanent plot site in the
   Alps, established in the frame of the Global Observation Research
   Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) on Schrankogel in the
   Tyrolean Alps, Austria, in 1994, and resurveyed in 2004 and 2014.
   Vascular plant species richness per plot increased over the entire
   period, albeit to a lesser extent in the second decade, because
   disappearance events increased markedly in the latter period. Although
   presence/absence data could only marginally explain range shift
   dynamics, changes in species cover and plant community composition
   indicate an accelerating transformation towards a more warmth-demanding
   and more drought-adapted vegetation, which is strongest at the lowest,
   least rugged subsite. Divergent responses of vertical distribution
   groups of species suggest that direct warming effects, rather than
   competitive displacement, are the primary causes of the observed
   patterns. The continued decrease in cryophilic species could imply that
   trailing edge dynamics proceed more rapidly than successful
   colonisation, which would favour a period of accelerated species
   declines.

AB Understanding the factors that drive spatial patterns in stream
   ecosystem processes and the distribution of aquatic biota is important
   to effective management of these systems and the conservation of biota
   at the network scale. In this study, we conducted field surveys
   throughout an extensive river network in NE Oregon that supports
   diminishing populations of wild salmonids. We collected data on physical
   habitat, nutrient concentrations, biofilm standing stocks, stream
   metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration
   [ER]), and ESA-listed juvenile salmonid density from approximately 50
   sites across two sub-basins. Our goals were to (1) to evaluate network
   patterns in these metrics, and (2) determine network-scale linkages
   among these metrics, thus providing inference of processes driving
   observed patterns. Ambient nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations were
   low across both sub-basins (< 40 lg/ L). Nitrate-N decreased with
   watershed area in both sub-basins, but phosphate-P only decreased in one
   sub-basin. These spatial patterns suggest co-limitation in one sub-basin
   but N limitation in the other; experimental results using nutrient
   diffusing substrates across both sub-basins supported these predictions.
   Solar exposure, temperature, GPP, ER, and GPP: ER increased with
   watershed area, but biofilm Chl a and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) did not.
   Spatial statistical network (SSN) models explained between 70% and 75%
   of the total variation in biofilm Chl a, AFDM, and GPP, but only 21% of
   the variation in ER. Temperature and nutrient concentrations were the
   most supported predictors of Chl a and AFDM standing stocks, but these
   variables explained little of the total variation compared to spatial
   autocorrelation. In contrast, solar exposure and temperature were the
   most supported variables explaining GPP, and these variables explained
   far more variation than autocorrelation. Solar exposure, temperature,
   and nutrient concentrations explained almost none of the variation in
   ER. Juvenile salmonids-a key management focus in these sub-basins-were
   most abundant in cool stream sections where rates of GPP were low,
   suggesting temperature constraints on these species restrict their
   distribution to oligotrophic areas where energy production at the base
   of the food web may be limited.

AB The causes of late-Holocene centennial to millennial scale climatic
   variability and the impact that such variability had on tropical
   ecosystems are still poorly understood. Here, we present a
   high-resolution, multiproxy record from lowland eastern Mesoamerica,
   studied to reconstruct climate and vegetation history during the last
   2,000 years, in particular to evaluate the response of tropical
   vegetation to the cooling event of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our data
   provide evidence that the densest tropical forest cover and the deepest
   lake of the last two millennia were coeval with the LIA, with two deep
   lake phases that follow the Sporer and Maunder minima in solar activity.
   The high tropical pollen accumulation rates limit LIA's winter cooling
   to a maximum of 2 degrees C. Tropical vegetation expansion during the
   LIA is best explained by a reduction in the extent of the dry season as
   a consequence of increased meridional flow leading to higher winter
   precipitation. These results highlight the importance of seasonal
   responses to climatic variability, a factor that could be of relevance
   when evaluating the impact of recent climate change.

AB Age-specific life tables of the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri
   (Mosley), feeding on lettuce were determined at different constant
   temperatures under controlled conditions. Our results showed that the
   proportion of alates increased with increasing temperatures, remaining
   below 7% at 16 degrees C and increasing to 40-57% at a temperature above
   20 degrees C. The longest developmental time of apterous aphids was
   obtained at 8 degrees C (31.5 d), and the shortest was at 26 degrees C
   (6.2 d), whereas the developmental time of alates was always 0.7-1.1 d
   longer than for apterous. Most aphids needed four instars to reach adult
   stage, but at 8, 26, and 28 degrees C, many individuals passed through
   five or six molts. Age-specific survivorship, (lx) was always above 90%
   at the temperature range of 16-24 degrees C. Mortality rate (qx) was
   rather low but constant at 8 degrees C. However, mortality was high at
   28 degrees C and occurred mainly in the last nymphal instars and adult
   stage. Unexpectedly, no nymphs were produced by the adult morpbs at 28
   degrees C, but effective fecundity was high at 8 degrees C. Fecundity
   for alates was always lower than for the apterous aphids at the same
   temperature. The largest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), and
   the mean relative growth rate (RGR) occurred at 24 degrees C, for both
   apterous and alate morpbs, and the lowest at 8 degrees C. Our results
   show that lettuce aphid is better adapted to survive and reproduce at
   low (8 degrees C) than at high (28 degrees C) temperatures, and its best
   performance occurred at 20-24 degrees C.

AB Large numbers of studies have reported on the responses of plants that
   are exposed to a specific dose of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation.
   However, in the natural environment UV-B is a highly dynamic variable
   with UV-B intensities depending on, amongst others, geographic,
   temporal, weather and climatic factors. Furthermore, UV-B effects on
   plants can potentially be modulated by other environmental variables,
   and vice versa. This study aimed to characterize UV-B effects on plant
   morphology and accumulation of UV-screening pigments within the context
   of an oceanic climate and to assess the potential seasonality of plant
   UV-B responses. Arabidopsis thaliana was grown outdoors under
   UV-blocking or transmitting filters. Genotypic differences in the
   adaptive response to UV-B were assessed at seven time-points over a 12
   month period and involved the Arabidopsis accessions Ler, Col-0, and
   Bur-0. Strong seasonal effects were found on rosette morphology and
   total UV-screening pigment concentrations across the three accessions.
   Low temperatures were the main determinant of accumulation of
   UV-absorbing pigments, with no clear UV-B effect observed at any time
   throughout the year. There was a significant UV effect on morphology
   during the summer months, and this was most likely associated with
   stress. This study shows that UV-effects need to be analysed in the
   context of weather, and other co-occurring natural factors, and
   emphasizes the importance of a holistic, multifactorial approach for the
   investigation of environmentally relevant UV-effects.

AB Environmental variability may cause changes in flowering phenology
   affecting plant reproductive success. Plasticity in phenological
   processes may guarantee species survival under new environmental
   conditions, such as those caused by global warming. Here we examined the
   flowering patterns of Thymelaea velutina (Thymelaeaceae), a dioecious
   shrub endemic to the Balearic Islands. We compared the two contrasting
   habitats where the species occurs: coastal dunes at sea level and
   mountain areas (c. 1200 m a.s.l.). We determined the relationship
   between three components of flowering phenology: initial date, flower
   duration, and synchrony, and assessed their association with traits
   describing plant size and fecundity. The increase in altitude results
   into a delayed flowering initiation and a shorter flowering period. In
   both habitats, male plants flowered earlier and for longer periods than
   females. At the mountain site, fruit set was associated to flower
   initiation, so that plants flowering earlier produced greater
   proportions of fruits. By contrast, fruit set at the dune site did not
   depend upon either flower initiation or flowering period; here, larger
   plants had longer flowering periods, though not necessarily produced
   more flowers and did not set more fruits than smaller plants. We
   attribute the differences in flowering patterns at different altitudes
   to phenotypic plasticity of the species; it is adapted to mountain
   conditions delaying the flowering period (probably adjusting it to the
   insect abundance at this altitude). Moreover, shortening of the
   flowering period may be also advantageous to reduce the stressful
   effects of higher temperature, radiation and drought that occur later in
   the summer.

AB The southern right whale's (Eubalaena australis) demography, occurrence,
   habitat use, and behavior off South Africa are known predominantly from
   an ongoing aerial survey data set that started in 1971. The fixed
   timeframes of these surveys and their geographical bias towards south
   coast nursery areas have constrained our knowledge about the right
   whale's seasonal distribution elsewhere. We present shore-based
   observations and tracking of right whales at Saldanha Bay on the west
   coast (20012003) that reveal a near year-round presence and strongly
   nearshore distribution. With seasonal progression from winter to summer
   we observed a gradual increase in sighting rate, reduction in swimming
   speed, less directionality of movement, an increase in group size, and
   more surface active groups. The area appears to be important for feeding
   and socializing but not as a calving or nursery area. Individual
   transits between the south and west coasts, bidirectional alongshore
   movements, and extended seasonal presence may all be indicative of
   reoccupation of their former range along the west coast. This is
   important given the increasing ship traffic at Saldanha Bay, the rapid
   expansion of the region's oil and gas industry, and the known
   vulnerability of the closely related North Atlantic right whale (E.
   glacialis) to ship strikes.

AB The thermal requirements of ectotherms may vary among species due to
   adaptation to different thermal environments. Nevertheless, some of
   these requirements are evolutionarily conserved, leading organisms to
   compensate behaviorally for harsh environmental conditions.
   High-mountain systems provide temperature gradients that allow for
   studies of evolutionary and plastic variation in thermal ecology under
   natural conditions. We evaluated the thermoregulation strategies of

   influenced by altitude and decrease with increasing elevation. However,
   lizards from the three different elevations have similar thermal
   requirements. High-altitude lizards have lower thermal accuracy and
   efficiency indices compared with those from the lower sites, owing to
   the low thermal quality of their environment. Nevertheless, they are
   efficient in thermoregulation, increasing their body temperature above
   the ambient temperature. We found that pregnant females from all three
   elevations had similar preferred body temperatures. Compared with
   nonpregnant females and males, they exhibited lower preferred
   temperatures and more accurate thermoregulation. The wide altitudinal
   distribution of S. grammicus is thus not caused by variable thermal
   requirements. Instead, the wide repertoire of physiological and
   behavioral strategies of these lizards allows this species to
   successfully inhabit contrasting environments.

AB The response of the tropical South-East Atlantic Ocean to the El Ni (n)
   over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied for the period
   1950-1999. Interaction between the ocean thermocline 'see-saw' and the
   overlying zonal wind circulation was examined. The two are closely
   linked through equatorial upwelling dynamics, with the thermocline
   leading during most of the period. Composite differences in climatic
   structure in respect of ENSO phase were analysed. Cases were selected
   based on indices of Pacific sea surface temperature and South-East
   African rainfall. Prior to an El Ni (n) over tildeo-induced drought,
   anomalous easterly flow over the Atlantic strengthens the cold tongue
   extending from Angola. How these climatic conditions affect fisheries
   abundance in the southern Benguela was investigated. Higher anchovy
   Engraulis encrasicolus catches tend to follow an El Ni (n) over tildeo
   event, and higher sardine Sardinops sagax catches tend to follow a La Ni
   (n) over tildea event, through the northward and southward shift
   respectively of the South Atlantic anticyclone and attendant coastal
   upwelling. In the southern Benguela, enhanced westerlies and warmer
   water favour anchovy catches over sardine catches. Recognition of the
   climatic patterns that impact fisheries abundance represents a potential
   management tool.

AB This paper aims to give a comprehensive atomistic modeling of the
   nanomechanical behavior of actin monomer. Actin is a ubiquitous and
   essential component of cytoskeleton which forms many different cellular
   structures. Despite for several years great effort has been devoted to
   the investigation of mechanical properties of the actin filament,
   studies on the nanomechanical behavior of actin monomer are still
   lacking. These scales are, however, important for a complete
   understanding of the role of actin as an important component in the
   cytoskeleton structure. Based on the accuracy of atomistic modeling
   methods such as molecular dynamics simulations, steered molecular
   dynamics method is performed to assess tension of monomeric G-actin
   molecule under different types of mechanical loading including axial and
   lateral. As a result, stress-strain curves are obtained in aqueous
   solution, with either ATP or ADP bound in the nucleotide binding pocket.
   The obtained results yield evaluation of the tensile stiffness of a
   single actin monomer in lateral and normal direction. In order to
   compare the behavior of ATP and ADP G-actins, the number of hydrogen
   bonds and nonbonded interactions between the nucleotide and the protein
   are analyzed. Moreover, The effect of virtual spring of steered
   molecular dynamics on the mechanical behavior of actin monomer is
   investigated. The results reveal increasing the virtual spring constant
   leads to convergence of the stiffness. Moreover, in this paper, a
   generalized model is proposed to extend the obtained results for the
   monomeric G-actin scale to the actin filament. Our modeling estimated a
   persistence length of actin filament 15.41 pm, close to experimental
   measurements. Moreover, In this paper, the breaking force actin-actin
   bond is evaluated using steered molecular dynamics simulation. By
   applying a tensile force, actin-actin bond ruptured at 4197.5 pN. (C)

AB In response to exogenous rhythms of light and temperature, most
   organisms exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e. cycles of behavior
   and gene expression with a periodicity of approximately 24 h). One of
   the defining characteristics of the circadian clock is its ability to
   synchronize (entrain) to an environmental rhythm. Entrainment is
   arguably the most salient feature of the clock in evolutionary terms.
   Previous quantitative trait studies of circadian characteristics in
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) considered leaf movement under
   constant (free-running) conditions. This study, however, addressed the
   important circadian parameter of phase, which reflects the entrained
   relationship between the clock and the external cycle. Here it is shown
   that, when exposed to the same photoperiod, Arabidopsis accessions
   differ dramatically in phase. Variation in the timing of circadian
   LUCIFERASE expression was used to map loci affecting the entrained phase
   of the clock in a recombinant population derived from two geographically
   distant accessions, Landsberg erecta and Cape Verde Islands. Four
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found with major effects on circadian
   phase. A QTL on chromosome 5 contained SIGNALING IN RED LIGHT REDUCED 1
   and PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 3, both genes known to affect the circadian
   clock. Previously unknown polymorphisms were found in both genes, making
   them candidates for the effect on phase. Fine mapping of two other QTL
   highlighted genomic regions not previously identified in any circadian
   screens, indicating their effects are likely due to genes not hitherto
   considered part of the circadian system.

AB Seasonal differences in metabolism and cold hardiness are common among
   small passerine birds. However, seasonal adjustments of metabolism and
   insulation are less well studied in nonpasserines and in larger birds.
   We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR), metabolic response to
   temperature, and maximal capacity for thermogenesis (peak cold-induced
   oxygen consumption, VO2 sum) in late spring/summer and winter in outdoor
   captive Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) near the northern
   boundary of their natural range, to determine whether seasonal
   adjustments in metabolism are a component of acclimatization in this
   species. Mass, BMR and regression equations describing diurnal and
   nocturnal metabolic response to temperature were not significantly
   different between seasons. After metabolic tests below thermoneutrality,
   cloacal temperature (T-b) was not dependent on ambient temperature (T-a)
   at either season, and nocturnal T-b did not differ significantly between
   seasons. However, after metabolic tests below thermoneutrality, diurnal
   T-b was significantly greater in summer (38.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C) than in
   winter (37.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C). Although body mass of winter birds was
   significantly greater than their body mass in late spring, maximal
   thermogenic capacity did not differ significantly on a seasonal basis,
   and winter bobwhite were only marginally more cold tolerant than late
   spring birds under severe cold stress. For individual birds tested in
   both winter and late spring, individual ranking of VO2 sum was not
   consistent between seasons (i.e., birds with a high VO2 sum in winter
   did not necessarily have a high VO2 sum in late spring). These data
   suggest little seasonal adjustment of metabolism or insulation in the
   Northern Bobwhite, a relatively large nonpasserine species native mainly
   to regions with relatively mild winter climates.

AB The overall net photosynthesis potential of Diapensia lapponica was very
   low. It was highest at the end of August (11.1 mu mol CO2 (mu mol
   chlorophyll)(-1) hr(-1)) and decreased during the autumn and winter,
   reaching a minimum in February (0.6 mu mol CO2 (mu mol chlorophyll)(-1)
   hr(-1)). In March, with increased light in the subarticum, the potential
   rose temporarily, and after another minimum at the beginning of May, the
   potential slowly rose to the summer level (2.3-6.5 mu mol CO2 (mu mol
   chlorophyll)(-1) hr(-1)). The seasonal fluctuation pattern of the
   potential of net photosynthesis was the same when calculated on a dry
   weight basis. Seasonal changes also occurred in the chlorophyll content
   and in the contents of polar lipids, particularly DGDG (digalactosyl
   diacylglycerols) and PC Ophosphatidyl choline) and less clearly in MGDG
   (monogalactosyl diacylglycerols), PE (phosphatidyl ethanolamine) and PG
   (phosphatidyl glycerols). The contents of chlorophylls, DGDG and PC
   increased during autumn and early winter during the hardening process
   and decreasing light and temperature. Their contents decreased in late
   winter and spring in response to dehardening and increased light and
   temperature in the subarcticum. Thus, the molar ratios of MGDG:DGDG and
   PE:PC varied throughout the year, being lowest in winter. In addition,
   fatty acids of individual lipid classes showed seasonal fluctuation. In
   both MGDG and DGDG, the proportion of linolenic acid was higher in
   summer than in winter and that of linoleic acid was vice versa. In both
   PC and PE, the proportion of palmitic acid was highest in summer and
   lowest in winter and, particularly in PC, this variation was compensated
   for by changes in linoleic acid and less clearly in linolenic acid, and,
   in PE, by the long-chain behenic acid. In PG, the proportions of
   trans-16:1 and oleic acid were higher in summer than in winter, whereas
   the proportions of palmitic and linoleic acids were higher in winter
   than in summer. Thus, there was not a clear increase in the degree of
   unsaturation of fatty acids during winter-time. (C) 1997 Published by

AB Reconstructions of surface paleoceanographic conditions of the western
   equatorial Atlantic and past climates of the adjacent Northeast
   Brazilian (the "Nordeste") continental margin were undertaken by
   analyzing sediments from a piston core and associated gravity and box
   cores recovered from 3107 meter water depth at 0 degrees 20' N on the
   equatorial Brazilian continental slope. The record is dated by
   radiocarbon analysis and oxygen isotopic stratigraphy of planktonic
   foraminifers and spans from near-modem to approximately 110 Ka.
   High-resolution XRF analysis provides insight into the paleoclimate
   history of the Nordeste during the last glacial interval. Several
   large-amplitude and abrupt peaks are observed in the time series of
   Ti/Ca and are usually accompanied by peaks of Fe/K. Together these
   record periods of increased precipitation and intense weathering on the
   adjacent continent and increased terrestrial sediment discharge from
   Nordeste rivers into the Atlantic. Within the limits of dating accuracy,
   most Ti/Ca peaks correlate with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic.
   This record thus corroborates, and extends back in time, the previous
   record of Arz et al. (1998) determined on sediment cores from farther
   southeast along the Nordeste margin.
   Stable oxygen isotopic analysis and Mg/Ca paleothermometry on the
   near-surface-dwelling planktonic foraminiferal species Globierinoides
   ruber find that mean sea-surface temperature (SST) during glacial time
   (20-55 Ka, n = 97) was 23.89 +/- 0.79 degrees C and the mean SST during
   the late Holocene (0-5 Ka, n = 14) was 26.89 +/- 0.33 degrees C. SSTs
   were 0.5-2 degrees C higher and inferred sea-surface salinities were
   lower during most of the periods of elevated Ti/Ca, thus, as observed in
   previous studies, the western equatorial Atlantic was warm (at least
   locally) and the adjacent southern tropical continent was wet at the
   same time that the high-latitude North Atlantic was cold.
   Using the SYNTRACE-CCSM3 fully coupled climate model with transient
   forcing for the period 22 Ka to present, we find that decreased
   transport of the North Brazil Current co-occurs with reduced Atlantic
   meridional overturning circulation, and colder-than-normal SSTs in the
   North Atlantic region. These simulated conditions are invariably
   associated with significantly increased precipitation in the Nordeste
   region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past century, the dendrochronology technique of crossdating has
   been widely used to generate a global network of tree-ring chronologies
   that serves as a leading indicator of environmental variability and
   change. Only recently, however, has this same approach been applied to
   growth increments in calcified structures of bivalves, fish and corals
   in the world's oceans. As in trees, these crossdated marine chronologies
   are well replicated, annually resolved and absolutely dated, providing
   uninterrupted multidecadal to millennial histories of ocean
   palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological processes. Moreover, they span an
   extensive geographical range, multiple trophic levels, habitats and
   functional types, and can be readily integrated with observational
   physical or biological records. Increment width is the most commonly
   measured parameter and reflects growth or productivity, though isotopic
   and elemental composition capture complementary aspects of environmental
   variability. As such, crossdated marine chronologies constitute powerful
   observational templates to establish climate-biology relationships, test
   hypotheses of ecosystem functioning, conduct multi-proxy
   reconstructions, provide constraints for numerical climate models, and
   evaluate the precise timing and nature of ocean-atmosphere interactions.
   These 'present-past-future' perspectives provide new insights into the
   mechanisms and feedbacks between the atmosphere and marine systems while
   providing indicators relevant to ecosystem-based approaches of fisheries
   management.

AB Understanding stomatal regulation is fundamental to predicting the
   impact of changing environmental conditions on vegetation. However, the
   influence of soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC) on
   canopy conductance (g(s)) through changes in belowground hydraulic
   conductance (k(bg)) remains poorly understood, because k(bg) has seldom
   been measured in field conditions. Our aim was to (a) examine the
   dependence of k(bg) on ST and SWC, (b) examine the dependence of g(s) on
   k(bg) and (c) test a recent stomatal optimization model according to
   which g(s) and soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance are strongly coupled.
   We estimated k(bg) from continuous sap flow and xylem diameter
   measurements in three boreal species. k(bg) increased strongly with
   increasing ST when ST was below +8 degrees C, and typically increased
   with increasing SWC when ST was not limiting. g(s) was correlated with
   k(bg) in all three species, and modelled and measured g(s) were well
   correlated in Pinus sylvestris (a model comparison was only possible for
   this species). These results imply an important role for k(bg) in
   mediating linkages between the soil environment and leaf gas exchange.
   In particular, our finding that ST strongly influences k(bg) in mature
   trees may help us to better understand tree behaviour in cold
   environments.

AB We studied the occurrence of large high frequency temperature
   fluctuations and their potential association with settlement of
   intertidal invertebrates during the spring/summer period 1999/2000 at
   Las Cruces, on the coast of central Chile. Our results showed the
   existence of internal tidal bores, characterized by sharp drops in water
   temperature at the surface and near the bottom, and subsequent
   temperature increases, which occurred with a semidiurnal periodicity.
   Measured currents support the hypothesis of alternating onshore and
   offshore movement of warm-water fronts. The frequency of the events
   varied through the summer and their amplitude seems to be modulated by
   onshore winds. The strongest events were observed when strong onshore
   winds occurred in late afternoon hours and the entire water column
   showed a semidiurnal temperature signal. Highest values of chlorophyll
   concentration in the intertidal zone and daily settlement of bivalves,
   gastropods and crustaceans were observed at times when conditions were
   favorable for occurrence of internal tidal bores. Results suggest that
   internal tidal bore warm fronts could play an important role in the
   transport of neustonic larval invertebrates and the delivery of
   phytoplankton to at least some intertidal sites along the coast of
   Chile. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As environmental temperatures increase and become more seasonally
   variable, the ability of individuals to plastically alter their
   physiological responses to temperature (=acclimatize) may affect the
   potential for species persistence. Among marine organisms, the larval
   stage is often the most physiologically sensitive; larvae are also often
   the main dispersal stage in the life history. However, studies that
   address the acclimatization of marine larvae are rare. We investigated
   whether larvae of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans from two
   temperate populations, one from the Northern Hemisphere (Mexico) and one
   from the Southern Hemisphere (Peru), show patterns of seasonal
   acclimatization to temperature. We compared the effects of temperature
   on swimming activity, oxygen consumption, and mortality of larvae from
   the two populations in both warm and cold seasons. Larvae from Mexico
   had higher thermal tolerances when collected in the boreal summer
   compared to the boreal winter, while no similar indication of seasonal
   acclimatization was seen in larvae from Peru. The lack of
   acclimatization in larvae of P. elegans from Peru may be related to
   recent thermal history, low selection for acclimatization due to
   irregular patterns of seasonal temperature change during ENSO events, or
   to different phylogeographic histories of Northern-and
   Southern-hemisphere populations.

AB The Alboran Sea is the westernmost ecoregion of the Mediterranean Sea.
   It is located in the vicinity of Strait of Gibraltar, the only natural
   connection of the Mediterranean Sea with global circulation. This
   ecoregion presents steep and highly variable environmental gradients,
   thus acting as a natural filter for Mediterranean and Atlantic species.
   This study aimed to analyse spatial patterns of littoral and upper
   sublittoral communities and their relationship with oceanographic
   conditions and coastal geomorphology, and to quantify littoral and upper
   sublittoral rocky shore communities at landscape scale. The results
   suggest that oceanographic conditions are the main factor to explain
   landscape patterns along the studied area, while geomorphological
   features should be related with local-scale variability. In this sense,
   three biogeographic subregions, matching with oceanographic patterns,
   were identified: western, central and eastern. These subregions showed
   significant differences in the structure and the composition of the
   littoral and upper sublittoral community, which can be explained by
   regional oceanographic dynamics. Posidonia oceanica, Cystoseira
   ericaefolia group and Mytilus spp. were the species that most
   contributed to landscape dissimilarity between the three subregions
   identified. The central oceanographic region, where the environmental
   conditions were more variable, showed the poorer and less differentiated
   flora, suggesting the existence of a divergent boundary between the
   Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Effects of some abiotic environmental conditions on amounts of essential
   oil and alpha-pinene therewith and enantiomeric composition of
   alpha-pinene in Juniperus communis L were studied. The leaf and unripe
   cone samples of total 110 cone-bearing J. communis individuals were
   sampled from 11 natural habitats, differing mainly by illumination
   intensity and soil chemical characteristics, across Lithuania. The
   analysis of alpha-pinene in essential oils of leaves and unripe cones
   was carried out by GC-FID, and the enantiomeric analysis of alpha-pinene
   - by chiral-phase capillary GC. The study confirmed that the unripe
   cones accumulate more essential oils than leaves (1.3 +/- SD 0.63% and
   0.4 +/- SD 0.14%, respectively), and the amount of essential oils in
   leaves negatively significantly correlated with illumination (r = -0.69,
   p < 0.05) and soil acidity (r = -0.83, p < 0.05) of habitats. The
   alpha-pinene was the main essential oil compound in 97% and 98% of all
   analysed leaf and unripe cone samples, respectively. Leaves and unripe
   cones contained very similar amounts of this monoterpene (54.1 +/- SD
   13.9% and 58.0 +/- SD 14.62%, respectively). Significant positive
   correlations between the percentage of alpha-pinene and the ratio of
   (1R)-(+)-alpha-pinene/(1S)-(-)-alpha-pinene in essential oils of cones
   and leaves implies that the synthesis of this monoterpene and its
   enantiomers both in leaves and cones is interdependent. It was
   established that the (1R)-(+)-alpha-pinene is more prevalent than
   (1S)-(-)-alpha-pinene both in leaves and unripe cones off communis
   growing wild in Lithuania, and that purity of (-) enantiomer varied more
   than purity of (+) enantiomer. Our study showed that the amount of
   alpha-pinene and its enantiomeric composition did not correlate
   significantly with the illumination and soil characteristics of habitats
   neither in leaves nor in unripe cones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The present study describes the seasonal distribution and abundance of
   brachyuran crab larvae from 5 families in lower Glacier Bay (SE Alaska,
   USA), and is one of the few field studies describing the entire pelagic
   phase of brachyuran larvae in Alaska. The larvae of most brachyuran
   species in Glacier Bay exhibited a highly seasonal pattern of abundance,
   which when first observed coincided with the onset of oceanographic
   conditions favorable to survival (high water temperature and abundant
   food supply). During May, larval abundance of Cancer magister increased
   by 63% relative to the first sampling date, that of C. oregonensis by
   92%, Fabia subquadrata by 69%, Pugettia spp. by 73%, and Majidae by 77%.
   The seasonal timing and larval duration of C. magister and 4 other
   species in Glacier Bay were compared with the same species at lower
   latitudes to substantiate the hypothesis that larval release time and
   duration are later and longer, respectively, with increasing latitude.
   The initial occurrence of zoeae is delayed by 3 to 4 mo relative to
   published release times in California, Oregon and Washington for these
   species. Further, the pelagic larval duration for C. magister is
   approximately 30 d longer in SE Alaska than published larval durations
   in lower latitudes, suggesting that both these phenomena are a function
   of the cool water temperatures found in the former region.

AB The dynamic assembly and disassembly of microtubules and the mechanical
   properties of these polymers are essential for many key cellular
   processes. Mathematical and computational modeling, especially coupled
   mechanochemical modeling, has contributed significantly to our
   understanding of microtubule dynamics. However, critical discrepancies
   exist between experimental observations and modeling results that need
   to be resolved before further progress toward a complete model can be
   made. Open sheet structures ranging in length from several hundred
   nanometers to one micron have often been observed at the growing ends of
   microtubules in in vitro studies. Existing modeling studies predict
   these sheet structures to be short and rare intermediates of microtubule
   disassembly rather than important components of the assembly process.
   Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies also reveal interesting step-like
   gaps of the force-indentation curve that cannot yet be explained by
   existing theoretical models. We have carried out computational studies
   to compare the mechanical properties of two alternative models: a more
   conventional model where tubulin dimers are added directly into a
   microtubule lattice, and one that considers an additional type of
   tubulin lateral interaction proposed to exist in intermediate sheet
   structures during the microtubule assembly process. The first model
   involves a single type of lateral interactions between tubulin subunits,
   whereas the latter considers a second type that can convert to the
   canonical lateral contact during microtubule closure into a cylinder.
   Our analysis shows that only the second model can reproduce the AFM
   results over a broad parameter range. We propose additional studies
   using different sizes of AFM tips that would allow to unambiguously
   distinguish the relative validity of the two models.

AB Seeds are central to crop production, human nutrition, and food
   security. A key component of the performance of crop seeds is the
   complex trait of seed vigour. Crop yield and resource use efficiency
   depend on successful plant establishment in the field, and it is the
   vigour of seeds that defines their ability to germinate and establish
   seedlings rapidly, uniformly, and robustly across diverse environmental
   conditions. Improving vigour to enhance the critical and yield-defining
   stage of crop establishment remains a primary objective of the
   agricultural industry and the seed/breeding companies that support it.
   Our knowledge of the regulation of seed germination has developed
   greatly in recent times, yet understanding of the basis of variation in
   vigour and therefore seed performance during the establishment of crops
   remains limited. Here we consider seed vigour at an ecophysiological,
   molecular, and biomechanical level. We discuss how some seed
   characteristics that serve as adaptive responses to the natural
   environment are not suitable for agriculture. Past domestication has
   provided incremental improvements, but further actively directed change
   is required to produce seeds with the characteristics required both now
   and in the future. We discuss ways in which basic plant science could be
   applied to enhance seed performance in crop production.

AB The pattern of olive oil accumulation is of paramount importance in
   olive because its influence in determining final oil yield and optimal
   harvesting date. In this work, we have evaluated the genetic and
   environment influence on the olive oil accumulation pattern. For that
   purpose, a set of cultivars and breeding selections planted in a
   multi-environment trial was evaluated in two consecutive harvest
   seasons. Significant effect of the environment, genotype and their
   interaction were observed for the maximum oil content reached and the
   rate of oil accumulation. On the contrary, the date of maximum oil
   content seems to depend only on the environment. The two breeding
   selections evaluated showed, in general, high stability and adaptability
   in oil accumulation parameters. Among the potential environmental
   factors that could affect oil accumulation, PLS analysis suggests that
   temperature could play a determinant environmental effect in the oil
   accumulation parameters tested in this study. These results underline
   the relevance of using multi-environment trials for adequate
   characterization of genotypes showing either good behaviour in variable
   environments or only under specific environmental conditions.

AB Three oceanographic surveys carried out in the Sicilian Channel during
   the spawning season (June to July) of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus)
   showed a close relationship between anchovy reproductive strategy and
   important hydrographic structures. A time series of satellite-derived
   sea surface temperature images of the Sicilian Channel were analysed by
   means of empirical orthogonal functions and the dominant empirical modes
   were studied in detail. The first empirical mode captured much of the
   original variance and reproduced the trajectory of the Atlantic Ionian
   Stream (AIS), the principal hydrodynamic feature of the area. The time
   coefficients of modes 1 and 2 had seasonal signals which, when combined,
   accounted for the enhancement of the thermal front, clearly visible off
   Cape Passero (southernmost coast of Sicily) during summer. As the area
   constituted the principal nursery ground of the Sicilian Channel
   anchovy, the combination of the time coefficients of these modes was
   considered a potential indicator of the food particle concentration
   usually associated with oceanic fronts, which provided the energy
   requirements for larval growth. Mode 3 described the north/south
   displacements of the mean AIS trajectory, which modified the surface
   temperature regime of the anchovy spawning habitat. Therefore, the time
   coefficients of this mode were used as a potential indicator of anchovy
   spawning habitat variability. The capability of time coefficients of
   modes 2 and 3 to modify the main pattern depicted by mode 1 were tested
   successfully against in situ oceanographic observations.

   evaluated the effects of strain, body weight, and gender on low-oxygen

   concentration of dissolved oxygen (0.1 mg/L). The variation in
   low-oxygen tolerance, assessed as the time to loss of equilibrium, of
   channel catfish from six strains (103KS, Kansas, KMix, Marion, Marion S,
   and Thompson) was examined. Catfish (15-179 g) showed a large variation
   in resistant time to hypoxia, ranging from 8 to 104 min, and both strain
   and body weight contributed significantly to this variation (P < 0.05).
   103KS and Marion S strains had higher low-oxygen tolerance than the
   other strains, while the Marion strain had the poorest low-oxygen
   tolerance (P < 0.05). In addition to genetic background, body weight
   positively correlated with low-oxygen tolerance, but there were no
   significant differences between female and male catfish in low-oxygen
   tolerance. The results indicate that genetic background and body weight
   are important factors that contribute variations in low-oxygen
   tolerance.

AB Understanding how habitat structure at multiple spatial scales
   influences vertebrates can facilitate development of effective
   conservation strategies, but until recently most studies have focused on
   habitat relationships only at fine or intermediate scales. In
   particular, patterns of amphibian occurrence across broad spatial scales
   are not well studied, despite recent concerns over regional and global
   declines. We examined habitat relationships of larval and neotenic
   Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), larval and adult
   Pacific tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) (hereafter "tailed frogs"), and
   torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.) at three spatial scales (2-m
   sample unit, intermediate, and drainage). In 1998 and 1999, we captured
   1568 amphibians in 702 sample units in 16 randomly chosen drainages in
   the Oregon Coast Range. We examined species-habitat associations at each
   spatial scale using an information-theoretic approach of analysis to
   rank sets of logistic regression models developed a priori. At the 2-m
   sample unit scale, all groups were negatively associated with proportion
   of small substrate and positively associated with stream width or
   elevation. At the intermediate scale, Pacific giant salamanders, adult
   tailed frogs, and torrent salamanders were positively associated with
   presence of a 46-m band of forested habitat on each side of the stream,
   and larval tailed frogs were positively associated with. presence of
   forest > 105 years old. Aspect was important for Pacific giant
   salamanders and larval tailed frogs at the intermediate scale. At the
   drainage scale, all groups except torrent salamanders were positively
   associated with proportion of stream length having forested bands > 46 m
   in width, but further analysis suggests narrower bands may provide
   adequate protection for some groups. Population- and community-level
   responses at broad spatial scales may be reflected in species-level
   responses at fine spatial scales, and our results suggest that
   geophysical and ecological characteristics, as well as measures of
   instream habitat, can be used together to prioritize conservation
   emphasis areas for stream amphibians in managed landscapes.

AB A natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in southern France was
   sampled in three different years and 10 isofemale lines were
   investigated from each sample. Two size-related traits, wing and thorax
   length, were measured and the wing/thorax ratio was also calculated.
   Phenotypic plasticity was analysed after development at seven different
   constant temperatures, ranging from 12 degrees C to 31 degrees C. The
   three year samples exhibited similar reaction norms, suggesting a stable
   genetic architecture in the natural population. The whole sample (30
   lines) was used to determine precisely the shape of each reaction norm,
   using a derivative analysis. The practical conclusion was that
   polynomial adjustments could be used in all cases, but with different
   degrees: linear for the wing/thorax ratio, quadratic for thorax length,
   and cubic for wing length. Both wing and thorax length exhibited concave
   reaction norms, with a maximum within the viable thermal range. The
   temperatures of the maxima were, however, quite different, around 15
   degrees C for the wing and 19.5 degrees C for the thorax. Assuming that
   thorax length is a better estimate of body size, it is not possible to
   state that increasing the temperature results in monotonically
   decreasing size (the temperature-size rule), although this is often seen
   to be the case for genetic variations in latitudinal clines. The
   variability of the traits was investigated at two levels-within and
   between lines-and expressed as a coefficient of variation. The
   within-line (environmental) variability revealed a regular, quadratic
   convex reaction norm for the three traits, with a minimum around 21
   degrees C. This temperature of minimum variability may be considered as
   a physiological optimum, while extreme temperatures are stressful. The
   between-line (genetic) variability could also be adjusted to quadratic
   polynomials, but the curvature parameters were not significant. Our
   results show that the mean values of the traits and their variance are
   both plastic, but react in different ways along a temperature gradient.
   Extreme low or high temperatures decrease the size but increase the
   variability. These effects may be considered as a functional response to
   environmental stress.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has primarily been studied in the context of
   adaptation to environmental fluctuations and its underlying genetic
   mechanisms. However, its impact on competition and coexistence has
   rarely been addressed. In this paper we analyzed the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of phenotypic plasticity in diel vertical
   migration of competing, physiologically distinguishable, Daphnia
   populations. We developed a model that evaluates the competitive
   strength of daphnids which are food limited and which face predation.
   Competitive strength is assessed by a population's ability to invade and
   defend a previously established site. Phenotypically plastic individuals
   were assumed to choose an evolutionarily stable migration strategy at
   any time during the invasion process. We found plasticity to increase a
   population's competitive ability and in special cases to support
   coexistence of similar populations. Including community structure in
   analyzing the adaptive Value of phenotypic plasticity reveals aspects
   that are not directly inferable from isolated population models. Hence,
   selection for plasticity may be more widespread than generally expected.

AB Considerable variation is inherent both within and between comparative
   physiological data sets. Known sources for such variation include diet,
   gender, time of day and season of experiment, among many other factors,
   but a meta-analysis of physiological studies shows that surprisingly few
   studies report controlling for these factors. In fact, less than 3% of
   comparative physiological papers mention epigenetics. However, our
   understanding of epigenetic influences on physiological processes is
   growing rapidly, and it is highly likely that epigenetic phenomena are
   an additional 'hidden' source of variation, particularly in wild-caught
   specimens. Recent studies have shown epigenetic inheritance of commonly
   studied traits such as metabolic rate (water fleas Daphnia magna; emu,
   Dromaius novaellandiae), hypoxic tolerance, cardiac performance
   (zebrafish, Danio rerio), as well as numerous morphological effects. The
   ecological and evolutionary significance of such epigenetic inheritance
   is discussed in a comparative physiological context. Finally, against
   this context of epigenetic inheritance of phenotype, this essay also
   provides a number of caveats and warnings regarding the interpretation
   of transgenerational phenotype modification as a true epigenetic
   phenomenon. Parental effects, sperm storage, multiple paternity and
   direct gamete exposure can all be confounding factors. Epigenetic
   inheritance may best be studied in animal models that can be maintained
   in the laboratory over multiple generations, to yield parental stock
   that themselves are free of epigenetic effects from the historical
   experiences of their parents.

AB Calcareous nannoplankton analyses on late quaternary sediments from the
   eastern North Atlantic ODP Site 980 (55 degrees 29'N, 14 degrees 42'W)
   provide detailed insight into palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic
   changes that occurred throughout the Termination II and the adjacent
   interglacial of the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. This study presents
   the development of the coccolah assemblage throughout the interglacial
   MIS 5 towards the beginning of the glacial MIS 4 in the vicinity of the
   Rockall Plateau and investigates and characterises the impact of
   climatic and environmental variations on the coccolith assemblage
   distribution between 135 and 65 ky
   In general, the coccolith assemblage is dominated by Gephyrocapsa
   muellerae and Emiliania huxleyi, whilst significant changes in
   palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic conditions are mainly shown by
   variations of subordinate species A drastic increase m coccolith
   accumulation rates and a change from a less to a higher diverse species
   assemblage indicate a rapid increase m surface water temperatures during
   the onset of MIS 5 from c. 127 5 ky on. Highest coccolith numbers, high
   numbers of taxa and a large diversity indicate highest coccolithophore
   primary productivity and peak interglacial conditions during MIS 5.5,
   which are due to the high influence of relatively warm surface water to
   this region. Coccolith numbers peak again around 120 ky and decline
   afterwards but stay above glacial levels. The two cooling events of MIS
   54 and 5 2 interrupt the generally warm conditions and are indicated by
   lowered coccolith numbers, a drop of thermophile species and a reduction
   of the species diversity. Decreasing coccolah numbers and a slightly
   reduced diversity indicate that environmental conditions deteriorated
   towards the onset of MIS 4 The analysis of the coccolith assemblage
   reveals that not only the stadia! events MIS 54 and 5 2 are
   characterised by colder conditions, but furthermore confirms the
   upcoming notion that MIS 5.5 was terminated by a slight short-term
   cooling of the surface water which occurred around 124 ky (C) 2010

AB Previously, we found that phrynosomatid lizards, a diverse group common
   in the southwestern USA, vary markedly in fiber-type composition of the
   iliofibularis (a hindlimb muscle important in locomotion).
   Phrynosomatidae comprises three subclades: the closely related sand and
   horned lizards, and their relatives the Sceloporus group. The variation
   in muscle fiber-type composition for 11 phrynosomatid species is
   attributable mainly to differences between the sand- and horned-lizard
   subclades. Here, we expand the phrynosomatid database with three
   additional species and compare these results with data collected for 10
   outgroup (distantly related) species. Our goal was to determine if the
   patterns found in Phrynosomatidae hold across a broader phylogenetic
   range of the extant lizards and to elucidate the evolution of muscle
   fiber-type composition and related traits. To allow for meaningful
   comparisons, data were collected from species that are primarily
   terrestrial and relatively small in size (3.5-65 g body mass). Results
   indicate that the fiber-type variation observed within the
   Phrynosomatidae almost spans the range of variation observed in our
   sample of 24 species from eight families. However, one species of
   Acanthodactylus (Lacertidae) had a consistent region of large tonic
   fibers (that did not stain darkly for either succinic dehydrogenase or
   myosin ATPase activity), a fiber-type only occasionally seen in the
   other 23 species examined. Many species have a large proportion of
   either fast-twitch glycolytic (FG; e.g. sand lizards and Aspidoscelis)
   or fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) fibers (e.g. horned lizards),
   with the slow-oxidative proportion occupying only 1-17% of the
   iliofibularis. Importantly, the negative relationship between FG and FOG
   composition observed in Phrynosomatidae appears to be a characteristic
   of lizards in general, and could lead to functional trade-offs in
   aspects of locomotor performance, as has previously been reported for
   Lacertidae. Reconstruction of ancestral trait values by use of
   phylogenetically based statistical methods indicates especially large
   changes in fiber-type composition during the evolution of horned
   lizards.

   and time scales (microns, seconds and longer) relevant to cellular
   biology. Continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of
   elasticity theory, fluid dynamics and statistical mechanics provide a
   framework for studying membrane biophysics over a range of mesoscopic to
   macroscopic length and time regimes, but the application of such ideas
   to simulation studies has occurred only relatively recently. We review
   some of our efforts in this direction with emphasis on the dynamics in
   model membrane systems. Several examples are presented that highlight
   the prominent role of hydrodynamics in membrane dynamics and we argue
   that careful consideration of fluid dynamics is key to understanding
   membrane biophysics at the cellular scale.

AB Physiological variation among and within species is thought to play a
   key role in determining distribution patterns across environmental
   gradients. We tested inter- and intraspecific variation in cold and heat
   tolerances for three grasshopper species (genus Kosciuscola) with
   overlapping elevation distributions, across their respective ranges in
   the Australian mountains. Of the three cold tolerance traits measured,
   the critical thermal minimum was the only trait to vary among species,
   with greater cold tolerance associated with a distribution extending to
   a higher elevation. Cold tolerance limits were regularly exceeded in
   exposed microhabitats, suggesting a role for cold adaptation in
   structuring species distribution patterns. In contrast to cold
   tolerance, heat tolerance variation was primarily partitioned within
   species. For two species, populations from treeless alpine habitat were
   more heat tolerant than their lower-elevation counterparts, supporting
   recent models that suggest greater exposure to temperature extremes at
   higher elevations. These contrasting patterns of physiological variation
   among and within species emphasise the importance of considering
   variation within species when attempting to understand how species
   distributions are affected by thermal extremes.

AB The seasonal and spatial distribution of Pseudocalanus acuspes in the

   March 2002 and May 2003 from stratified (10 m) multinet samples. The
   highest abundances were reached in May 2002 and April 2003 (618x10(3)
   and 869x10(3) ind. m(-2), respectively). Ontogenetic vertical
   distribution was stage specific with differences of mean annual weighted
   mean depth > 30 m between nauplii and males; it followed closely the
   hydrography which was characterized by a permanent halocline and a
   summer thermocline. The vertical distribution showed a positive
   correlation with salinity especially in the older developmental stages;
   the relationship to temperature was negative in the nauplii and
   copepodite stage I (CI). Most of the stages performed a seasonal
   migration. The consequences of the vertical distribution patterns in
   relation to the effects of climate and predation are discussed. A stage
   shift from nauplii in April/May to CIV and CV as overwintering stages
   indicated slow seasonal development. However, nauplii were observed all
   the year round, and the resulting stage structure did not allow to
   distinguish generations. Changes in the prosome length of females seemed
   to be related to the advection of water masses with different
   temperatures rather than to different generations. It could not be
   clarified whether the strong increase of nauplii and adults after an
   inflow event of cold, saline North Sea water in the beginning of 2003
   was a result of advection or improvement in habitat conditions.

AB Optimal defense theory predicts that induction of defensive secondary
   metabolites in plants will be inversely correlated with constitutive
   expression of those compounds. Here, we asked whether camalexin, an
   important defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens, support this
   prediction in structured natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
   from the Iberian Peninsula. In common garden experiments, we found that
   genotypes from the VIE population constitutively hyper-accumulated
   camalexin. Camalexin concentrations were not induced significantly when
   plants were exposed to a temperature of 10 degrees C for 48 h. However,
   they were induced when plants were exposed to 48 h of infection by the
   virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.
   Genotypes from the VIE population with the hyper-accumulation of
   camalexin were significantly more resistant to bacterial growth.
   Induction of camalexin was negatively correlated with constitutive
   camalexin concentrations following log transformation and two different
   corrections for autocorrelation, thus supporting the tradeoff predicted
   by optimal defense theory. Constitutive overexpression of camalexin was
   not explained by the only known natural genetic polymorphism at the
   Accelerated Cell Death 6, ACD6, locus. Collectively, the results support
   an important role of camalexin in defense against P. syringae as well as
   significant structured variation in defense levels within wild
   populations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Skeletons of Norian corals from the aragonite Konservat-Lagerstatte in
   Alakir Cay, Turkey are commonly considered to be exceptionally
   preserved. However, one example of Pachysolenia cylindrica shows that
   although aragonite is the dominant mineral phase (about 86.2%), the
   distribution of microscale diagenetic features in the skeleton
   complicate its usage as a paleoenvironmental archive. We used a density
   separation technique to isolate aragonite-enriched powders of skeletal
   material, which compared to powders of bulk skeleton (similar to 8.3%
   more calcite than aragonite-enriched powders), exhibit higher Sr/Ca (by
   an average of 0.27 mmol/mol), lower Mg/Ca (by an average of 1.34
   mmol/mol), and lower delta O-18 (by an average of 0.28 parts per
   thousand). In addition, paleo-sea surface temperatures calculated using
   values from bulk measurements are 1.1-3.4 degrees C colder (3.3-3.4
   degrees C for Sr/Ca and 1.1-2.0 degrees C for delta O-18) than
   temperatures calculated from the density-separated, aragonite-enriched
   powders. These data suggest that the presence of about 13.8% of
   secondary calcite can influence the robustness of geochemical proxies
   and that density separation is an effective tool for recovering the
   original geochemical signal from diagenetically altered samples.

AB The Eastern Canadian northern shrimp population, representing one of the
   most important fisheries in the region, decreased dramatically since the
   mid-2000s to a historical low in 2017, but changes were not spatially
   uniform. Applying a biophysical model within Newfoundland and Labrador
   (NL) management areas, we investigated connectivity processes during the
   long pelagic larval phase (2-3 months) of Pandalus borealis and key
   drivers of larval dispersal in different environmental conditions. We
   selected 3 years representative of contrasting North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) phases to assess potential larval dispersal patterns
   of the northern shrimp population in NL, and hierarchically assessed the
   impact of the timing of release (yearly and daily), release location,
   and vertical migration behaviour on shrimp larval dispersal. Overall, we
   found that populations located on the northern Newfoundland and Labrador
   shelf supplied potential settlers to southern populations because of the
   dominant Labrador Current. Ocean circulation and current velocities
   during the NAO positive year differed from other years, generating
   contrasting settlement spatial patterns. Larval release location and
   vertical migration behaviour were the two most important influences on
   the strength of larval supply and settlement patterns. Inclusion of diel
   and ontogenic swimming behaviour increased settlement success of larvae
   released from inshore areas, regardless of study years. Our study
   improves understanding of northern shrimp stock-recruitment
   relationships, their sensitivity to changing environmental conditions,
   and spatially non-homogeneous population decline for bentho-pelagic
   species with a long larval phase, which could potentially help improve
   management strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Drip application of insecticides is an effective way to
   deliver the chemical to the plant that avoids off-site movement via
   spray drift and minimizes applicator exposure. The aim of this paper is
   to present a cascade model for the uptake of pesticide into plants
   following drip irrigation, its application for a soil-applied
   insecticide and a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters.
   RESULTS: The model predicted the measured increase and decline of
   residues following two soil applications of an insecticide to peppers,
   with an absolute error between model and measurement ranging from 0.002
   to 0.034 mg kg fw(-1). Maximum measured concentrations in pepper fruit
   were approximately 0.22 mg kg fw(-1). Temperature was the most sensitive
   component for predicting the peak and final concentration in pepper
   fruit, through its influence on soil and plant degradation rates.
   CONCLUSION: Repeated simulations of pulse inputs with the cascade model
   adequately describe soil pesticide applications to an actual cropped
   system and reasonably mimic it. The model has the potential to be used
   for the optimization of practical features, such as application rates
   and waiting times between applications and before harvest, through the
   integrated accounting of soil, plant and environmental influences. (C)

AB Natural variation for freezing tolerance is a major component of
   adaptation and geographic distribution of plant species. However, little
   is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms that determine its
   naturally occurring diversity. We have analyzed the intraspecific
   freezing tolerance variation existent between two geographically distant
   accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Cape Verde Islands
   (Cvi) and Landsberg erecta (Ler). They differed in their freezing
   tolerance before and after cold acclimation, as well as in the cold
   acclimation response in relation to photoperiod conditions. Using a
   quantitative genetic approach, we found that freezing tolerance
   differences after cold acclimation were determined by seven quantitative
   trait loci (QTL), named FREEZING TOLERANCE QTL 1 (FTQ1) to FTQ7. FTQ4
   was the QTL with the largest effect detected in two photoperiod
   conditions, while five other FTQ loci behaved as photoperiod dependent.
   FTQ4 colocated with the tandem repeated genes C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 1
   (CBF1), CBF2, and CBF3, which encode transcriptional activators involved
   in the cold acclimation response. The low freezing tolerance of FTQ4-Cvi
   alleles was associated with a deletion of the promoter region of Cvi
   CBF2, and with low RNA expression of CBF2 and of several CBF target
   genes. Genetic complementation of FTQ4-Cvi plants with a CBF2-Ler
   transgene suggests that such CBF2 allelic variation is the cause of CBF2
   misexpression and the molecular basis of FTQ4.

AB The thermal limits of individual animals were originally proposed as a
   link between animal physiology and thermal ecology. Although this link
   is valid in theory, the evaluation of physiological tolerances involves
   some problems that are the focus of this study. One rationale was that
   heating rates shall influence upper critical limits, so that ecological
   thermal limits need to consider experimental heating rates. In addition,
   if thermal limits are not surpassed in experiments, subsequent tests of
   the same individual should yield similar results or produce evidence of
   hardening. Finally, several non-controlled variables such as time under
   experimental conditions and procedures may affect results. To analyze
   these issues we conducted an integrative study of upper critical
   temperatures in a single species, the ant Atta sexdens rubropiosa, an
   animal model providing large numbers of individuals of diverse sizes but
   similar genetic makeup. Our specific aims were to test the 1) influence
   of heating rates in the experimental evaluation of upper critical
   temperature, 2) assumptions of absence of physical damage and
   reproducibility, and 3) sources of variance often overlooked in the
   thermal-limits literature; and 4) to introduce some experimental
   approaches that may help researchers to separate physiological and
   methodological issues. The upper thermal limits were influenced by both
   heating rates and body mass. In the latter case, the effect was
   physiological rather than methodological. The critical temperature
   decreased during subsequent tests performed on the same individual ants,
   even one week after the initial test. Accordingly, upper thermal limits
   may have been overestimated by our (and typical) protocols. Heating
   rates, body mass, procedures independent of temperature and other
   variables may affect the estimation of upper critical temperatures.
   Therefore, based on our data, we offer suggestions to enhance the
   quality of measurements, and offer recommendations to authors aiming to
   compile and analyze databases from the literature.

AB Field metabolic rate (FMR) is key to understanding individual and
   population-level responses to environmental changes, but is challenging
   to measure in field conditions, particularly in aquatic environments.
   Here we show that FMR can be estimated directly from the isotopic
   composition of carbon in fish otoliths (delta C-1(3)oto). We describe
   the relationship between delta C-13(oto) values and oxygen consumption
   rate, and report results from laboratory experiments relating
   individual-level measurements of oxygen consumption rates to delta
   C-13(oto) values in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). We apply our new
   delta(13)C(oto )metabolic proxy to existing delta(13)C(oto )data from
   wild cod and four deepwater fish species to test the validity of
   inferred FMR estimates. The delta(13) C(oto )metabolic proxy offers a
   new approach to study physiological ecology in free-ranging wild fishes.
   Otolith-based proxies for FMR are particularly promising as they allow
   retrospective assessment of time-integrated, individual-level FMR
   throughout an individual fish's life history.

AB We describe depth-dependent variation in the condition and length-at-age
   of southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod (Gadus morhua) on their feeding
   grounds in September 1971-2000. Bathymetric variation in condition
   appears to be linked to abundance. In periods of low abundance,
   condition was relatively uniform over shallow and intermediate depths
   (<100-125 m). During periods of high abundance, condition was highest in
   the shallowest waters and declined steadily as depth increased to 100
   in. In all periods, condition was low in deep water. Bathymetric trends
   in length-at-age contrasted with those in condition. Length-at-age was
   high in the deep waters where condition was low. Length-at-age also
   tended to increase from minimum values at intermediate depths to high
   values in shallow waters. This tendency was most striking in the 1990s,
   a period when condition was uniform over this depth range. We discuss
   the ecological, bioenergetic, and sampling implications of these
   patterns.

AB Contrary to previous assumptions that most mutations are deleterious,
   there is increasing evidence for persistence of large-effect mutations
   in natural populations. A possible explanation for these observations is
   that mutant phenotypes and fitness may depend upon the specific
   environmental conditions to which a mutant is exposed. Here, we tested
   this hypothesis by growing large-effect flowering time mutants of
   Arabidopsis thaliana in multiple field sites and seasons to quantify
   their fitness effects in realistic natural conditions. By constructing
   environment-specific fitness landscapes based on flowering time and
   branching architecture, we observed that a subset of mutations increased
   fitness, but only in specific environments. These mutations increased
   fitness via different paths: through shifting flowering time, branching,
   or both. Branching was under stronger selection, but flowering time was
   more genetically variable, pointing to the importance of indirect
   selection on mutations through their pleiotropic effects on multiple
   phenotypes. Finally, mutations in hub genes with greater connectedness
   in their regulatory networks had greater effects on both phenotypes and
   fitness. Together, these findings indicate that large-effect mutations
   may persist in populations because they influence traits that are
   adaptive only under specific environmental conditions. Understanding
   their evolutionary dynamics therefore requires measuring their effects
   in multiple natural environments.

AB We use time-series analyses to characterize the effects of recent
   climate variability upon the local physical conditions at 11 study sites
   along the northern-central coast of Chile (29-34 degrees S).
   Environmental indices show that the 1 degrees Bakun upwelling index in
   this coastal region has fluctuated in time, starting from a stable
   period around the 1980's, peaking during the mid 90s, decreasing during
   the next ten years and increasing at a steep rate since 2010. Upwelling
   intensity decreased with increasing latitude, showing also a negative
   correlation with climate patterns (El Nino3 sea surface temperature-SST
   anomalies and the Multivariate El Nino Index). We hypothesize that the
   impacts of climate variability on upwelling events seem to be spatially
   heterogeneous along the region. Non-sheltered locations and,
   particularly, sites on prominent headlands show an immediate (lag = 0)
   and negative correlation between local SST, upwelling events and wind
   stress. We suggest that near-shore thermal conditions are closely
   coupled to large-scale forcing of upwelling variability and that this
   influence is modulated through local topographic factors.

AB Headwater streams contribute to overall production and life history
   diversity in river systems. These relatively small streams represent an
   alternative rearing habitat for juvenile fish, including Coho Salmon
   Oncorhynchus kisutch. To determine the extent that juvenile Coho Salmon
   use headwater habitats, we used a spatially continuous sampling approach
   to investigate the distribution and density patterns of juvenile Coho
   Salmon in three headwater streams of the Little Susitna River, Alaska.
   We related the distribution patterns to environmental and biological
   variables, which are important for informed management of this species.
   Juvenile Coho Salmon were continuously distributed along the length of
   headwater streams, with upstream limits of 4-5km from the main stem, at
   about 250m elevation, with slopes between 4% and 5%. For all juvenile
   Coho Salmon, elevation and dominant substrate type (e.g., boulders) were
   negatively related to fish density; both variables may be related to
   adult spawning habitat and the proximity of juveniles to their point of
   emergence. Age-1 Coho Salmon, which overwinter in the Little Susitna
   River basin before smolting, represented only 2% of all juvenile fish
   captured; no environmental variables related to age-1 fish density. Yet,
   their presence in the headwater streams represented an opportunity to
   determine what factors relating to conservation and fisheries management
   (i.e., culverts) may limit their distribution. Headwater stream habitats
   may increase the variability in life history and juvenile traits, and
   given ongoing climate change and human development this type of
   variability is likely to be increasingly important for the persistence
   and continued productivity of this population of Pacific salmon.

AB Dramatic changes in length-at-age have been observed in many populations
   of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Northwest Atlantic over the past
   20-30 years. We tested for density- and temperature-dependent effects on
   length-at-age over this period for cod in four populations, the southern
   Gulf of St. Lawrence stock (referred to here as 4T cod), the northern
   Gulf of St. Lawrence stock (3Pn4RS), the northeastern Scotian Shelf
   stock (4VsW) and the southwestern Scotian Shelf stock (4X). Effects were
   tested using a modified von Bertalanffy growth model, in which
   L-infinity was density- and/or temperature-dependent. For the 4T stock,
   effects of both density and temperature were significant, with faster
   growth at lower densities and higher temperatures. Results were similar
   for the 4VsW stock, except that the effect of density was slight
   compared to the effect of temperature. Only the effect of temperature
   was significant for the 3Pn4RS stock, with faster growth at wanner
   temperatures. Age alone accounted for most of the interannual variation
   in mean length of 4X cod, and neither density nor temperature effects
   were significant for this stock. Measures of both cod ambient
   temperature (bottom temperature weighted by cod distribution) and
   general temperature conditions in the environment (i.e., temperatures
   unweighted by cod distribution) were used for the 4T stock, but only the
   latter were available for the other stocks. For the 4T stock, ambient
   temperature was the most important explanatory variable in 4-parameter
   models (i.e., three von Bertalanffy parameters plus one additional
   explanatory variable). However, more of the variation in mean length was
   explained by the 5-parameter model with cod abundance and general
   environmental temperature than by either of the 5-parameter models that
   included ambient temperature. Strong patterns were evident in the
   residuals from the growth models, especially for the 4T, 4VsW and 3Pn4RS
   stocks. These patterns were similar between stocks, and suggested the
   action of some factor not accounted for in the models, possibly
   variation in size-selective mortality. Crown Copyright (C) 2002

AB The constraint of a rotating earth has led to the evolution of a
   circadian clock that drives anticipation of future environmental
   changes. During this daily rotation, the circadian clock of Arabidopsis
   thaliana (Arabidopsis) intersects with the diurnal environment to
   orchestrate virtually all transcriptional processes of the plant cell,
   presumably by detecting, interpreting, and anticipating the
   environmental alternations of light and temperature. To comparatively
   assess differential inputs toward phenotypic and physiological responses
   on a circadian parameter, we surveyed clock periodicity in a recombinant
   inbred population modified to allow for robust periodicity measurements
   after entrainment to respective photic vs. thermal cues, termed
   zeitgebers. Lines previously thermally entrained generally displayed
   reduced period length compared to those previously photically entrained.
   This differential zeitgeber response was also detected in a set of
   diverse Arabidopsis accessions. Thus, the zeitgebers of the preceding
   environment direct future behavior of the circadian oscillator. Allelic
   variation at quantitative trait loci generated significant differences
   in zeitgeber responses in the segregating population. These were
   important for periodicity variation dependent on the nature of the
   subsequent entrainment source. Collectively, our results provide a
   genetic paradigm for the basis of environmental memory of a preceding
   environment, which leads to the integrated coordination of circadian
   periodicity.

AB Climate change will have important implications in water shore regions,
   such as Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) plain, where expected warmer and drier
   conditions might augment crop water demand. Sensitivity analysis is
   important in understanding the relative importance of climatic variables
   to the variation in reference evapotranspiration (ET0). In this study,
   the 51-yr ET0 during winter wheat and summer maize growing season were
   calculated from a data set of daily climate variables in 40
   meteorological stations. Sensitivity maps for key climate variables were
   estimated according to Kriging method and the spatial pattern of
   sensitivity coefficients for these key variables was plotted. In
   addition, the slopes of the linear regression lines for sensitivity
   coefficients were obtained: Results showed that ET0 during winter wheat
   growing season accounted for the largest proportion of annual ET0 due to
   its long phenological days, while ET0 was detected to decrease
   significantly with the magnitude of 0.5 mm yr(-1) in summer maize
   growing season. Solar radiation is considered to be the most sensitive
   and primarily controlling variable for negative trend in ET0 for summer
   maize season, and higher sensitive coefficient value of ET0 to solar
   radiation and temperature were detected in east part and southwest part
   of 311 plain respectively. Relative humidity was demonstrated as the
   most sensitive factor for ET0 in winter wheat growing season and
   declining relativity humidity also primarily controlled a negative trend
   in ET0, furthermore the sensitivity coefficient to relative humidity
   increased from west to southeast. The eight sensitivity centrals were
   all found located in Shandong Province. These ET0 along with its
   sensitivity maps under winter wheat-summer maize rotation system can be
   applied to predict the agricultural water demand and will assist water
   resources planning and management for this region.

AB From 1976 to 1978 there was a change in the climate over the North

   the sea surface adjacent to North America and a cooling offshore.
   Associated with this change was a period of exceptional fish production.
   Strong year classes and above-average survival occurred for many
   commercially important species all along the west coast of Canada and
   the United States. Trends in total salmon catches increased primarily
   from increased salmon production in Alaska. Some stocks of maturing pink
   (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho (O. kisutch), and chinook salmon (O.
   tshawytscha) also had above-average growth in 1977. A majority of
   commercially important nonsalmon species that spawned from California to
   the Bering Sea and have a wide range of life history types also had
   exceptionally strong year classes from 1976 to 1978. The exceptional
   survival appears to be related to improved ocean productivity caused by
   changes in the intensity of the Aleutian Low.

AB Growing evidence shows that increasing global temperature causes
   population declines and latitudinal shifts in geographical distribution
   for plants living near their thermal limits. Yet, even populations
   living well within established thermal limits of a species may suffer as
   the frequency and intensity of warming events increase with climate
   change. Adaptive response to this stress at the population level depends
   on the presence of genetic variation in thermal tolerance in the
   populations in question, yet few data exist to evaluate this. In this
   study, we examined the immediate effects of a moderate warming event of
   4.5 degrees C lasting 5 weeks and the legacy effects after a 5 week
   recovery on different genotypes of the marine plant Zostera marina
   (eelgrass). We conducted the experiment in Bodega Bay, CA USA, where
   average summer water temperatures are 14-15 degrees C, but extended
   warming periods of 17-18 degrees C occur episodically. Experimental
   warming increased shoot production by 14% compared to controls held at
   ambient temperature. However, after returning temperature to ambient
   levels, we found strongly negative, delayed effects of warming on
   production: shoot production declined by 27% and total biomass decreased
   by 50% relative to individuals that had not been warmed. While all
   genotypes' production decreased in the recovery phase, genotypes that
   grew the most rapidly under benign thermal conditions (control) were the
   most susceptible to the detrimental effects of warming. This suggests a
   potential trade-off in relative performance at normal vs. elevated
   temperatures. Modest short-term increases in water temperature have
   potentially prolonged negative effects within the species' thermal
   envelope, but genetic variation within these populations may allow for
   population persistence and adaptation. Further, intraspecific variation
   in phenology can result in maintenance of population diversity and lead
   to enhanced production in diverse stands given sufficient frequency of
   warming or other stress events.

AB In recent years a northward expansion of Sardinella aurita has been
   reported in the western Mediterranean. Considering the coexistence of
   its larvae with those of the dominant species Engraulis encrasicolus,
   the present study was conducted to compare their vertical distributions
   in 2 areas off the Catalan coast with different vertical environmental
   conditions. During summer, the water column was stratified with a deep
   chlorophyll maximum (DCM) beneath the pycnocline. However, the southern
   area, under the influence of the Ebro River, was characterized by a
   secondary surface chlorophyll maximum. Vertical distribution of larval
   food, nauplii and copepodites showed good agreement with the high
   chlorophyll layers. In the earliest stages of development, larvae of
   both species remained in the upper levels. From 6 mm standard length on
   they developed a day/night migratory behaviour to search for food during
   the day (feeding period). Therefore, in the south, where the abundance
   of potential food in the upper layers was relatively high, larvae of
   both species remained in the upper levels during the day. However, in
   the north, where food was restricted to the DCM, only E. encrasicolus
   larvae were able to reach these deep levels. The low temperatures
   (similar to 15 degrees C) detected at the DCM may restrict the vertical
   migration of S. aurita in accordance with their thermophilic character.
   This limitation might represent a restriction for the northward
   expansion of this species in the western Mediterranean.

AB Vertebral number is adaptively important in fishes and is associated
   with body shape at broad taxonomic ranks. Less is known about this
   association within species. Rhoadsia is a deep-bodied characid genus
   endemic to western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. It includes two
   species differing in body depth (BD), described from different drainages
   and elevations. Recently, BD has been found to vary with elevation in
   parallel between similar to 30 and 1260 m across drainages in western
   Ecuador. Here, we report that vertebral number also covaries with
   elevation and with body shape. The latter association was present both
   across and within sites, suggesting that these traits are phenotypically
   integrated. The ratio of precaudal to caudal vertebrae also differed
   significantly among drainages, and variation in vertebral number
   appeared to be associated primarily with the caudal vertebrae, raising
   questions about its potential adaptive significance given the functional
   importance of caudal vertebrae in fishes. Vertebral number was
   associated with body size at some sites, consistent with geographically
   localized pleomerism. Disentangling the causative mechanisms at play

AB Development of chilling and freezing tolerance is complex and can be
   affected by photoperiod, temperature and photosynthetic performance;
   however, there has been limited research on the interaction of these
   three factors. We evaluated 108 recombinant inbred lines of Boechera
   stricta, derived from a cross between lines originating from Montana and
   Colorado, under controlled long day (LD), short-day (SD) and in an
   outdoor environment (OE). We measured maximum quantum yield of
   photosystem II, lethal temperature for 50% survival and electrolyte
   leakage of leaves. Our results revealed significant variation for
   chilling and freezing tolerance and photosynthetic performance in
   different environments. Using both single- and multi-trait analyses,
   three main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. QTL on
   linkage group (LG)3 were SD specific, whereas QTL on LG4 were found
   under both LD and SD. Under all conditions, QTL on LG7 were identified,
   but were particularly predictive for the outdoor experiment. The
   co-localization of photosynthetic performance and freezing tolerance
   effects supports these traits being co-regulated. Finally, the major QTL
   on LG7 is syntenic to the Arabidopsis C-repeat binding factor locus,
   known regulators of chilling and freezing responses in Arabidopsis
   thaliana and other species.

AB We characterized the association between climate and somatic growth in
   125 North American populations of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu.
   Using multivariate techniques (i.e., principal components and Procrustes
   analyses), we found an overall significant concordance between eight
   climate variables (cloud cover, frost frequency, precipitation, mean air
   temperature, minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, mean
   summer air temperature, and growing degree-days above 10 degrees C) and
   four growth variables (body length increments for ages 1-4). Bivariate
   linear regressions revealed that there was a significant positive
   relationship between air temperature variables and early growth, while
   growth at later ages was generally less influenced by climate. Given
   that the geographical range of smallmouth bass has been rapidly
   expanding over the past century, we also examined how the climate-growth
   relationships differed in populations that have been introduced outside
   the native distribution. Analysis of residuals from the Procrustes test
   indicated that the concordance between climate and growth was probably
   higher for populations within the native range and lower for introduced
   populations. Mechanisms that might generate this pattern include the
   possibilities that (1) the introduced populations have not had time to
   adapt to their new environments and (2) growth might respond atypically
   to the more extreme climates experienced outside the native range of the
   species.

AB Clinal analysis for fitness-related traits provides a well-known
   approach to investigate adaptive evolution. Several fitness-related
   traits (developmental time, thorax length, wing length and wing loading)
   were measured at two laboratory generations (G7 and G33) of D. buzzatii
   from an altitudinal gradient from northwestern Argentina, where
   significant thermal differences persist. Developmental time (DT) was
   positively correlated with altitude of origin of population. Further, DT
   was negatively correlated with maximal mean temperature at the site of
   origin of population, and this thermal variable decreases with altitude.
   Wing loading tended to be larger in highland than in lowland
   populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger
   selection pressure in highland populations. Developmental time showed a
   significant increase with laboratory generation number. There was no
   significant correlation between developmental time and body size across
   populations along the altitudinal cline of DT. This result illustrates
   that developmental time and body size do not always evolve in the same
   direction, even though both traits are often positively and genetically
   correlated in a well-known tradeoff in Drosophila.

AB Fourteen tree-ring width chronologies were developed along three
   altitudinal gradients for three mountain ranges in and north central
   China. The chronology statistics, combined with results of a rotated
   principle component analysis (RPCA), suggest that physiological
   gradients play a more important role in determining tree-growth patterns
   than altitudinal gradients. As indicated by climate-growth
   relationships, temperature is mainly related to the low-frequency
   tree-ring variability, while precipitation is more influential on the
   high-frequency tree-ring variability. At the low-frequency band,
   chronologies across species from lower and upper forest limits were
   generally well correlated, except at the upper site of the Xinglong
   Mountain. It is plausible that similar temperature-shaped climate-growth
   relationships in the low-frequency domain may lead to similar growth
   patterns at this frequency band. Regarding the differing results for the
   Xinglong Mountain, our interpretation is that the changed growth
   patterns resulted from the varying climate-growth correlation patterns
   along the larger altitudinal gradients. The temperature and
   precipitation limitations for tree growth decrease along the increasing
   altitudinal gradients.

   were obtained from DNA extracted directly from wood pieces collected

   Either a 2569bp or 2573bp sequence was obtained from 88 of 143 samples.
   Together with the 45 rDNA sequences of pinewood nematode isolates
   previously reported, there were eight single nucleotide polymorphisms
   and two indels of two bases. Based on these mutations, nine haplotypes
   were estimated. The haplotype frequencies differed among regions in
   Kyushu island (northwest, northeast and center, southeast, and
   southwest), and the distribution was consistent with the invasion and
   spreading routes of the pinewood nematode previously estimated from past
   records of pine wilt and wood importation. There was no significant
   difference in haplotype frequencies among the collection sites on
   Okinawa island.

AB The relationship between the phytohormones, gibberellin (GA) and
   abscisic acid (ABA) and light and temperature on seed germination is
   still not well understood. We aimed to investigate the role of the ABA
   and GA on seed germination of Vellozia caruncularis, V.intermedia and
   V.alutacea in response to light/dark conditions on different
   temperature.
   Seeds were incubated in GA (GA(3) or GA(4)) or ABA and their respective
   biosynthesis inhibitors (paclobutrazol - PAC, and fluridone - FLU)
   solutions at two contrasting temperatures (25 and 40 degrees C).
   Furthermore, endogenous concentrations of active GAs and those of ABA
   were measured in seeds of V.intermedia and V.alutacea during
   imbibition/germination.
   Exogenous ABA inhibited the germination of Vellozia species under all
   conditions tested. GA, FLU and FLU+GA(3) stimulated germination in the
   dark at 25 degrees C (GA(4) being more effective than GA(3)). PAC
   reduced seed germination in V.caruncularis and V.alutacea, but did not
   affect germination of V.intermedia at 40 degrees C either under light or
   dark conditions. During imbibition in the dark, levels of active GAs
   decreased in the seeds of V.intermedia, but were not altered in those of
   V.alutacea. Incubation at 40 degrees C decreased ABA levels during
   imbibition in both V.caruncularis and V.alutacea.
   We conclude that the seeds of Vellozia species studied here require
   light or high temperature to germinate and ABA has a major role in the
   regulation of Vellozia seed germination in response to light and
   temperature.

AB In animals with complex life cycles, the environment experienced early
   during the development may have strong effects on later performance and
   fitness. We investigated the intraspecific variation in the effects of
   larval temperature environment on the morphology and locomotory
   performance of juvenile pool frogs Rana lessonae originating from three
   closely located populations of the northern fringe metapopulation in
   central Sweden. Tadpoles were raised individually at two temperatures
   (20 and 25 degrees C) until metamorphosis. We measured the morphology of
   the metamorphs and tested the jumping performance of the froglets after
   complete tail absorption. We found that early temperature environment
   affected juvenile morphology, metamorphs from high-temperature
   environments having relatively longer hindlimbs (tibiofibulas) and
   longer tails when weight at metamorphosis was accounted for. In absolute
   terms, froglets from low temperature jumped significantly longer;
   however, after correcting for size differences the relationship was
   reversed, individuals raised at high temperature performing better. In
   both temperatures, relative jumping performance was positively
   associated with tibiofibula and body length. Populations differed both
   in metamorphic traits and in jumping capacity, especially at low
   temperature, suggesting microgeographical variation in temperature
   sensitivity within the metapopulation. Our results indicate that the
   temperature environment experienced during the early aquatic stages can
   influence the morphology and performance of juvenile frogs, and that
   these effects can be population specific.

AB The record-breaking heat-wave in summer 2003 was expected to have a
   strong impact on tree growth, especially where trees occur at their
   ecological limits. We studied radial growth response of Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.)
   exposed to dry inner Alpine climate (Tyrol, Austria) to extreme hot and
   dry conditions in 2003. Tree ring chronologies from two stands
   comprising different social status, i.e. dominant, co-dominant and
   suppressed trees, on a south- and north-facing slope, which represent
   xeric and dry-mesic site conditions, respectively, were analysed.
   Growth-climate relationships were explored using response function
   analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients. Major findings of our
   study were: (i) radial growth in 2003 was strongest reduced in
   suppressed P. sylvestris growing on a xeric site and in dominant Picea
   abies growing on the dry-mesic site, (ii) median reductions in annual
   increments reached 35% compared to previous years (1998-2002) and were
   caused by early stop of cambial activity as indicated by pronounced
   decrease in latewood width and (iii) April through June precipitation
   was the environmental factor most strongly associated with growth of
   both species. Ring width of P. sylvestris and Picea abies was
   additionally limited by hot late spring and hot late spring/summer
   months, respectively. The minor impact of the 2003 summer heat-wave on
   growth of drought exposed forest trees might find its explanation in
   strong dependency of radial stem growth on precipitation during late
   spring and preconditioning of tree vigor in previous years. Results
   demonstrate that impact of climate extremes on radial tree growth can
   vary within site and canopy position and strongly depend on
   species-specific response to climate factors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The objectives of this study were to determine if coccinellids adjusted
   their distribution within spring wheat fields in response to spatial
   variation cereal aphid density in the fields and to describe the
   patterns of cereal aphid population growth that resulted. Field
   experiments were completed in which the physical dimensions of patches
   infested with cereal aphids, cereal aphid density, and access to patches
   by coccinellids were varied. Aphid infestations consisted of naturally
   occurring densities (natural patches) and much greater densities created
   by supplementing patches with aphids (supplemented patches).
   Coccinellids were denied access to some supplemented patches (exclusion
   patches) but allowed unlimited access to others. Densities of adult
   Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septem-punctata were correlated
   with aphid density in patches whereas density of Coleomegilla maculata
   was not. Aggregation by coccinellids was independent of patch area. The
   realized aphid population growth rate (r) was lower in supplemented than
   natural patches in all four trials but was significantly lower in only
   one trial. The lower r in supplemented patches was not exclusively
   caused by coccinellid predation, and emigration of aphids from patches
   probably also contributed, r was significantly greater in exclusion
   patches than supplemented and natural patches, indicating that
   coccinellids markedly reduced aphid numbers in patches even when aphid
   density was extremely high.

AB 1. The following three hypotheses explaining why spruce bud moth
   (Zeiraphera canadensis Mut. and Free.) populations decline at crown
   closure were evaluated: (i) first-instar larval mortality increases as a
   result of asynchrony between budburst and egg hatch (phenology
   hypothesis); (ii) larval mortality increases and fecundity of females
   decreases due to decreased nutritional quality of shaded foliage
   (nutrition hypothesis); and (iii) egg densities decrease because females
   lay fewer eggs in closed stands (oviposition preference hypothesis).
   2. Field experiments and surveys supported the phenology and oviposition
   preference hypotheses but not the nutrition hypothesis.
   3. Increases in the degree of asynchrony between the time of egg hatch
   and budburst following increased shading of tree crowns resulted in high
   mortality of first instars in closed stands.
   4. In closed stands budburst was delayed because snow cover reduced soil
   and root temperatures when air temperatures were above the minimum
   threshold for egg development. Consequently, many eggs (which are
   located in the crown) hatched before buds burst.
   5. Decreases in larval survival following crown closure were not
   attributable to changes in the nutritional quality of shaded foliage for
   larval development and did not influence adult sex ratios in 2 of 3
   years.
   6. Females that developed on closed or open trees were of similar size,
   indicating that declines in population density following crown closure
   were not due to reduced fecundity.
   7. When trees in a closed stand were opened by removing nearby trees,
   they were subjected to higher levels of herbivory. Egg hatch was more
   closely synchronized with budburst on opened than on closed trees.
   8. We conclude that declines in bud moth populations following crown
   closure are caused by increased first-instar larval mortality, resulting
   from temporal asynchrony between budburst and egg hatch, and reduced
   oviposition caused by female preference for open trees.

AB Genetic variation in freezing resistance was evaluated among and within
   six populations of Spanish wild chestnut (Castanea sativa Miller). The
   extent to which frost susceptibility was related to phenology and the
   relationship between population differentiation and climatic conditions
   was studied.
   Twigs were collected in March and November from saplings (5-year-old
   trees) of 41 open-pollinated families from the six populations in a
   provenance-progeny test, and were subjected to artificial freezing.
   Damage to each twig was assessed as visible browning of bud and of stem
   tissues.
   Population differences as regards frost damage traits were highly
   significant (p < 0.01) in both spring and autumn. Family differences
   within populations were low, often non-significant, and in all cases
   smaller than differences among populations. Population means were
   closely correlated with the parental drought and frost conditions.
   Populations originating from dry areas or from regions where frost
   seldom occurs were the least resistant.
   Drought is suggested to be the one of the most important selective
   agents that shapes population differentiation in Spanish wild chestnut,
   while frost may be more important in northern Spain. Phenological
   differences are not always good predictors of the degree of frost
   damage. Thus, freezing tests should be used to detect frost
   susceptibility in chestnuts.

AB Microtubules (MTs) have been proposed to act mechanically as compressive
   struts that resist both actomyosin contractile forces and their own
   polymerization forces to mechanically stabilize cell shape. To identify
   the origin of MT bending, we directly observed MT bending and F-actin
   transport dynamics in the periphery of LLC-PK1 epithelial cells. We
   found that F-actin is nearly stationary in these cells even as MTs are
   deformed, demonstrating that MT bending is not driven by actomyosin
   contractility. Furthermore, the inhibition of myosin II activity through
   the use of blebbistatin results in microtubules that are still
   dynamically bending. In addition, as determined by fluorescent speckle
   microscopy, MT polymerization rarely results, if ever, in bending. We
   suppressed dynamic instability using nocodazole, and we observed no
   qualitative change in the MT bending dynamics. Bending most often
   results from anterograde transport of proximal portions of the MT toward
   a nearly stationary distal tip. Interestingly, we found that in an in
   vitro kinesin-MT gliding assay, MTs buckle in a similar manner. To make
   quantitative comparisons, we measured curvature distributions of
   observed MTs and found that the in vivo and in vitro curvature
   distributions agree quantitatively. In addition, the measured MT
   curvature distribution is not Gaussian, as expected for a thermally
   driven semiflexible polymer, indicating that thermal forces play a minor
   role in MT bending. We conclude that many of the known mechanisms of MT
   deformation, such as polymerization and acto-myosin contractility, play
   an inconsequential role in mediating MT bending in LLC-PK1 cells and
   that MT-based molecular motors likely generate most of the strain energy
   stored in the MT lattice. The results argue against models in which MTs
   play a major mechanical role in LLC-PK1 cells and instead favor a model
   in which mechanical forces control the spatial distribution of the MT
   array.

AB For organisms to adapt to future environments, they must both evolve
   appropriate functional responses and phenotypically express those
   responses under future climatic and CO2 conditions. We examined these 2
   components of future adaptation in an invasive annual plant (Polygonum
   cespitosum) by performing a "resurrection" experiment under field
   conditions simulating a future environment. Resurrection experiments
   reveal recent evolution by comparing genotypes from natural populations
   sampled across a multigeneration interval. We collected genotypes from
   the same 3 North American populations in 1994 and 2005 and raised inbred
   lines from these collections under free air CO2 enrichment to examine
   functional and fitness traits expressed in hot, dry conditions at both
   ambient and elevated CO2 (N = 295 plants). The species has rapidly
   evolved in its introduced range to increase photosynthetic rate
   (collection year effect P = 0.011) and delay senescence (P = 0.017)
   under full-sun, dry field conditions, but these adaptive changes were
   not expressed when the field environment included elevated CO2
   (within-treatment year effect P = 0.20 for both traits). Populations
   showed different levels of reproductive output and its genetic variance
   in these novel, stressful conditions. These findings illustrate
   constraints on evolutionary adaptation to predicted future conditions at
   both the species and population levels.

AB Thermal and nutritional stress are commonly experienced by animals. This
   will become increasingly so with climate change. Whether populations can
   plastically respond to such changes will determine their survival.
   Plasticity can vary among populations depending on the extent of
   environmental heterogeneity. However, theory conflicts as to whether
   environmental heterogeneity should increase or decrease plasticity.
   Using three locally adapted populations ofDrosophila melanogastersampled
   from a latitudinal gradient, we investigated whether plastic responses
   to combinations of nutrition and temperature increase or decrease with
   latitude for four traits: egg-adult viability, egg-adult development
   time, and two body size traits. Employing nutritional geometry, we
   reared larvae on 25 diets varying in protein and carbohydrate content at
   two temperatures: 18 and 25 degrees C. Plasticity varied among traits
   and across the three populations. Viability was highly canalized in all
   three populations. The tropical population showed the least plasticity
   for development time, the sub-tropical showed the highest plasticity for
   wing area, and the temperate population showed the highest plasticity
   for femur length. We found no evidence of latitudinal plasticity
   gradients in either direction. Our data highlight that differences in
   thermal variation and resource predictability experienced by populations
   along a latitudinal cline are not sufficient to predict their
   plasticity.

AB The snow cover extent in mid-high latitude areas of the Northern
   Hemisphere has significantly declined corresponding to the global
   warming, especially since the 1970s. Snow-climate feedbacks play a
   critical role in regulating the global radiation balance and influencing
   surface heat flux exchange. However, the degree to which snow cover
   changes affect the radiation budget and energy balance on a regional
   scale and the difference between snow-climate and land use/cover change
   (LUCC)-climate feedbacks have been rarely studied. In this paper, we
   selected Heilongjiang Basin, where the snow cover has changed obviously,
   as our study area and used the WRF model to simulate the influences of
   snow cover changes on the surface radiation budget and heat balance. In
   the scenario simulation, the localized surface parameter data improved
   the accuracy by 10 % compared with the control group. The spatial and
   temporal analysis of the surface variables showed that the net surface
   radiation, sensible heat flux, Bowen ratio, temperature and percentage
   of snow cover were negatively correlated and that the ground heat flux
   and latent heat flux were positively correlated with the percentage of
   snow cover. The spatial analysis also showed that a significant
   relationship existed between the surface variables and land cover types,
   which was not obviously as that for snow cover changes. Finally, six
   typical study areas were selected to quantitatively analyse the
   influence of land cover types beneath the snow cover on heat absorption
   and transfer, which showed that when the land was snow covered, the
   conversion of forest to farmland can dramatically influence the net
   radiation and other surface variables, whereas the snow-free land showed
   significantly reduced influence. Furthermore, compared with typical land
   cover changes, e.g., the conversion of forest into farmland, the
   influence of snow cover changes on net radiation and sensible heat flux
   were 60 % higher than that of land cover changes, indicating the
   importance of snow cover changes in the surface-atmospheric feedback
   system.

AB The impact of climate change on strongly age-structured populations is
   poorly understood, despite the central role of temperature in
   determining developmental rates in ectotherms. Here we examine the
   effect of warming and its interactions with resource availability on the
   population dynamics of the pyralid moth Plodia interpunctella,
   populations of which normally show generation cycles, a consequence of
   strong and asymmetric age-related competition. Warming by 3 degrees C
   above the standard culture temperature led to substantial changes in
   population density, age structure, and population dynamics. Adult
   populations were some 50% larger in warmed populations, probably because
   the reduced fecundity associated with warming leads to reduced larval
   competition, allowing more larvae to develop to adulthood. Warming also
   interacted with resource availability to alter population dynamics, with
   the generation cycles typical of this species breaking down in the 30
   degrees populations when standard laboratory diet was provided but not
   when a reduced nutrient poor diet was used. Warming by 6 degrees led to
   either rapid extinction or the persistence of populations at low
   densities for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that even
   moderate warming can have considerable effects on population structure
   and dynamics, potentially leading to complete changes in dynamics in
   some cases. These results are particularly relevant given the large
   number of economically important species that exhibit generation
   cycling, in many cases arising from similar mechanisms to those
   operating in P.interpunctella.

AB A cost-effective climate change adaptation strategy for the forestry
   sector is to move seed sources to more northern and higher elevation
   planting sites as part of ongoing reforestation programs. This is meant
   to match locally adapted populations with anticipated environments, but
   adaptive traits do not always show population differences suitable to
   mitigate climate change impacts. For white spruce, drought tolerance is
   a critical adaptive trait to prevent mortality and productivity losses.
   Here, we use a 40-year-old provenance experiment that has been exposed
   to severe drought periods in 1999 and 2002 to retrospectively
   investigate drought response and the adaptive capacity of white spruce
   populations across their boreal range. Relying on dendrochronological
   analysis under experimentally controlled environments, we evaluate
   population differences in resistance, resilience, and recovery to these
   extreme events. Results showed evidence for population differentiation
   in resistance and recovery parameters, but provenances conformed to
   approximately the same growth rates under drought conditions and had
   similar resilience metrics. The lack of populations with better growth
   rates under drought conditions is contrary to expectations for a
   wide-ranging species with distinct regional climates. Populations from
   the wettest environments in the northeastern boreal were surprisingly
   drought-tolerant, suggesting that these populations would readily resist
   water deficits projected for the 2080s, and supporting the view that
   northeastern Canada will provide a refugium for boreal species under
   climate change. The findings also suggest that white spruce is sensitive
   to growth reductions under climate change in the western boreal. The
   study highlights that population differentiation in adaptive capacity is
   species- and trait-specific, and we provide a counterexample for drought
   tolerance traits, where assisted migration prescriptions may be
   ineffective to mitigate climate change impacts. For resource managers
   and policy makers, we provide maps where planning for widespread
   declines of boreal white spruce forests may be unavoidable.

AB AimWe evaluated whether the performance of individuals and populations
   of the invasive plant Verbascum thapsus differs between its native and
   non-native ranges, across climate gradients, and in response to its
   position in a global-scaled niche model.
   LocationIndia (Kashmir) and Switzerland (native range) and Australia and
   USA (Hawaii, Montana and Oregon) (non-native range).
   MethodsWe measured population characteristics (density of flowering
   individuals, population size), plant traits (plant height, number of
   flowering branches) and seed germination for 50 populations of V.
   thapsus growing along elevational gradients in six mountain regions
   around the world (two in the native range, and four in the non-native
   range). We fitted linear regression models to determine the relationship
   of plant and population level performance variables to range, region,
   climate and probability of occurrence from a global niche model.
   ResultsPlant height, number of flowering branches and population density
   of V. thapsus did not differ consistently between the native and
   non-native ranges, but the area covered by populations in the non-native
   range was on average two orders of magnitude larger than the area of
   native populations. Within and among regions, individual plant
   performance traits responded variably to precipitation and mean annual
   temperature, depending on the climatic range of the observed
   populations; however, performance was greater for populations that had a
   greater modelled probability of occurrence. Seed germination under
   controlled conditions was highest between 20 and 35 degrees C and
   consistent across populations, although germination at low temperatures
   was substantially higher for native populations from Kashmir.
   Main conclusionsThe introduction of V. thapsus to its non-native range
   is not associated with consistent increases in plant performance.
   Instead, plant performance is more strongly influenced by position
   within the climate niche of the species, position along environmental
   gradients, and climatic or other differences among regions. We
   demonstrate that individual-level and population-level performance
   traits can yield different predictors of plant performance. Therefore,
   future studies comparing plant performance in native and non-native
   ranges should include both plant and population characteristics and
   should also sample the target species from multiple regions in both
   ranges and along environmental gradients that comprehensively represent
   the niche of the species.

   Salmo trutta) in an attempt to understand relationships among
   biogeography, prey communities, and climate on diet composition at

   diet patterns remained the same at global scales. At regional scales, we
   uncovered comprehensive patterns in diet composition among neighbouring
   freshwater ecoregions, with site-specific prey communities as the best
   predictor of the observed prey utilization patterns. Thus, we posit that
   environmental gradients altering site-specific prey communities and
   consequently the trophic niche of the predator through bottom-up
   mechanisms are key in understanding spatial dietary patterns. Proximity
   was also important for the revealed biogeographic patterns at global
   scales. We suggest that geographic location (latitude and elevation) as
   a proxy of environmental heterogeneity is key at small spatial scales,
   and climate at global extents, to understand spatial dietary patterns.
   Our findings support the hypothesis that future shifts in prey
   communities due to climate change will strengthen biographical patterns
   in feeding of freshwater fishes, with consequences for invasiveness
   assessment and nature management and conservation.

AB Barley is used for food and feed, and brewing. Nondormant seeds are
   required for malting, but the lack of dormancy can lead to preharvest
   sprouting (PHS), which is also undesired. Here, we report several new
   loci that modulate barley seed dormancy and PHS. Using genome-wide
   association mapping of 184 spring barley genotypes, we identified four
   new, highly significant associations on chromosomes 1H, 3H, and 5H
   previously not associated with barley seed dormancy or PHS. A total of
   71 responsible genes were found mostly related to flowering time and
   hormone signalling. A homolog of the well-known Arabidopsis Delay of
   Germination 1 (DOG1) gene was annotated on the barley chromosome 3H.
   Unexpectedly, DOG1 appears to play only a minor role in barley seed
   dormancy. However, the gibberellin oxidase gene HvGA20ox1 contributed to
   dormancy alleviation, and another seven important loci changed
   significantly during after-ripening. Furthermore, nitric oxide release
   correlated negatively with dormancy and shared 27 associations. Origin
   and growth environment affected seed dormancy and PHS more than did
   agronomic traits. Days to anthesis and maturity were shorter when seeds
   were produced under drier conditions, seeds were less dormant, and PHS
   increased, with a heritability of 0.57-0.80. The results are expected to
   be useful for crop improvement.

AB The body size of a univoltine carabid beetle Carabus tosanus on Shikoku
   Island, Japan, was clearly smaller in higher-altitude populations
   (subspecies), which possibly represents incipient speciation. To explore
   the determinants of altitudinal differences in body size in this
   species, we studied the degree of phenotypic plasticity by conducting
   rearing experiments at two constant temperatures and examined genetic
   differences through interpopulation crosses. At 15 degrees C, C. tosanus
   had a longer developmental period and a shorter adult body than at 20
   degrees C. Nevertheless, variation in body size due to temperature
   effects (phenotypic plasticity) was small compared to the
   interpopulation differences, which suggests substantial genetic
   differences between populations (subspecies) at different altitudes. In
   F1 offspring from crosses between a low-altitude (subspecies tosanus)
   and a high-altitude population (subspecies ishizuchianus), adult body
   length was affected by the genotypes of both parents, with an
   interaction effect of parental genotype and offspring sex. Further
   analyses revealed that adult body length was affected by sex-linked
   factors in addition to autosomal factors. These genetic differences in
   body size may have resulted from adaptations to different altitudes and
   may be important for the process of incipient speciation because body
   size differences could contribute to premating reproductive isolation.

   their activities to shallow and highly productive waters with
   temperatures ranging from 5 to 8 degrees C. However, analysis of
   migration patterns, in conjunction with remotely-sensed sea surface
   temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration data, showed
   that habitat use and movement were substantially different for the 2
   years. Both years were characterised by different oceanographic
   conditions; comparison of SST revealed colder temperatures in 2002 than
   the long-term average, while temperatures in 2003 were not significantly
   different from average conditions. The movement of rockhopper penguins
   differed between years: penguins migrated to the same general locations
   but used a larger number of foraging areas in 2002. They also spent less
   time travelling than in 2003. Moreover, we also found differences in
   adult survival or return rate and breeding success between years.
   Consequently, we conclude that during colder winters with more
   heterogeneous oceanographic conditions (e.g. 2002), penguins are better
   able to find enough food to achieve body condition for the following
   breeding season.

AB Variation in climate, particularly temperature, is known to affect the
   genetic composition of populations. Although there have been many
   studies of latitudinal variation, comparisons of populations across
   altitudes or seasons, particularly for animal species, are less common.
   Here, we study genetic variation (microsatellite markers) in populations
   of Drosophila buzzatii collected along altitudinal gradients and in
   different seasons. We found no differences in genetic variation between
   2 years or between seasons within years. However, there were numerous
   cases of significant associations between allele frequencies or expected
   heterozygosities and altitude, with more than half showing nonlinear
   relationships. While these associations indicate possible selection and
   local altitudinal adaptation, direct tests gave strong evidence for
   selection affecting two loci and weaker evidence for five other loci.
   Two loci that are located within an inversion (including the one with
   strongest evidence for selection) show a linear increase in genetic
   diversity with altitude, likely due to thermal selection. Parallel
   associations with altitude here and with latitude in Australian
   populations indicate that selection is operating on chromosomal regions
   marked by some of the loci.

AB I summarize marine studies on plastic versus adaptive responses to
   global change. Due to the lack of time series, this review focuses
   largely on the potential for adaptive evolution in marine animals and
   plants. The approaches were mainly synchronic comparisons of
   phenotypically divergent populations, substituting spatial contrasts in
   temperature or CO2 environments for temporal changes, or in assessments
   of adaptive genetic diversity within populations for traits important
   under global change. The available literature is biased towards
   gastropods, crustaceans, cnidarians and macroalgae. Focal traits were
   mostly environmental tolerances, which correspond to phenotypic
   buffering, a plasticity type that maintains a functional phenotype
   despite external disturbance. Almost all studies address coastal species
   that are already today exposed to fluctuations in temperature, pH and
   oxygen levels. Recommendations for future research include (i)
   initiation and analyses of observational and experimental temporal
   studies encompassing diverse phenotypic traits (including diapausing
   cues, dispersal traits, reproductive timing, morphology) (ii)
   quantification of nongenetic trans-generational effects along with
   components of additive genetic variance (iii) adaptive changes in
   microbe-host associations under the holobiont model in response to
   global change (iv) evolution of plasticity patterns under increasingly
   fluctuating environments and extreme conditions and (v) joint
   consideration of demography and evolutionary adaptation in evolutionary
   rescue approaches.

AB The environmental effects of climate change are expected to impact
   fisheries, and related economies, and represent a significant challenge
   for the development of government policy. The impact of ocean warming on
   fisheries yields is of particular concern. The effect of sea surface
   temperature (SST) on fisheries in three distinct biogeographic areas
   (north-western, NW; south-western, SW; and south, S) and different fleet
   sectors (trawl, seine, and multi-gear) of the Portuguese coast was
   examined. The mean temperature of the catch (MTC) was applied to the
   official landings statistics to assess the effect of global warming on
   the exploited marine communities. MTC increased from 16.9, 16.7, and
   17.4 degrees C in 1989 to 17.9, 18.1, and 18.3 degrees C in 2009,
   whereas the linear rate of MTC increase was 0.54, 0.49, and 0.70 degrees
   C per decade in the NW, SW, and S regions, respectively. The increase of
   warmer species in fisheries landings is regional-specific. The
   percentage increases in landings of warmer water species increased
   significantly from north to south: 5.1, 6.7, and 18% per decade in the
   NW, SW, and S, respectively. The results confirmed that ocean warming
   has affected the composition of fisheries landings (of warmer and colder
   species) in the three regions of the Portuguese coast. The results
   highlight the importance and urgency of considering the
   temperature-induced shift in species distribution in fisheries
   management.

AB In this paper, we review the role of the norpA-encoded phospholipase C
   in light and thermal entrainment of the circadian clock in Drosophila
   melanogaster.We extend our discussion to the role of norpA in the
   thermo-sensitive splicing of the per 3' UTR, which has significant
   implications for seasonal adaptations of circadian behaviour. We use the
   norpA mutant-generated enhancement of persplicing and the corresponding
   advance that it produces in the morning (M) and evening (E) locomotor
   component to dissect out the neurons that are contributing to
   thisnorpAphenotype using GAL4/UAS. We initially confirmed, by
   immunocytochemistry andin situhybridisation in adult brains, that norpA
   expression is mostly concentrated in the eyes, but we were unable to
   unequivocally revealnorpAexpression in the canonical clock cells using
   these methods. In larval brains, we did see some evidence for
   co-expression of NORPA with PDF in clock neurons. Nevertheless,
   downregulation ofnorpAin clock neurons did generate behavioural advances
   in adults, with the eyes playing a significant role in thenorpAseasonal
   phenotype at high temperatures, whereas the more dorsally located
   CRYPTOCHROME-positive clock neurons are the likely candidates for
   generating the norpA behavioural effects in the cold. We further show
   that knockdown of the related plc21C encoded phospholipase in clock
   neurons does not alterpersplicing nor generate any of the behavioural
   advances seen withnorpA.Our results with downregulating norpA and plc21C
   implicate the rhodopsins Rh2/Rh3/Rh4 in the eyes as mediatingper 3' UTR
   splicing at higher temperatures and indicate that the CRY-positive LNds,
   also known as 'evening' cells are likely mediating the low-temperature
   seasonal effects on behaviour via alteringper 3'UTR splicing.

AB This study assesses the impact of a changing climate on fish fauna by
   comparing the past mean state of fish assemblage to a possible future
   mean state. It is based on (1) local scale observations along an
   Inner-Alpine river called Mur, (2) an IPCC emission scenario (IS92a),
   implemented by atmosphere-ocean global circulation model (AOGCM)
   ECHAM4/OPYC3, and (3) a model-chain that links climate research to
   hydrobiology. The Mur River is still in a near-natural condition and
   water temperature in summer is the most important aquatic ecological
   constraint for fish distribution. The methodological strategy is (1) to
   use downscaled air temperature and precipitation scenarios for the first
   half of the twenty-first century, (2) to establish a model that
   simulates water temperature by means of air temperature and flow rate in
   order to generate water temperature scenarios, and (3) to evaluate the
   impact on fish communities using an ecological model that is driven by
   water temperature. This methodology links the response of fish fauna to
   an IPCC emission scenario and is to our knowledge an unprecedented
   approach. The downscaled IS92a scenarios show increased mean air
   temperatures during the whole year and increased precipitation totals
   during summer, but reduced totals for the rest of the annual cycle.
   These changes result in scenarios of increased water temperatures, an
   altered annual cycle of flow rate, and, in turn, a 70 m displacement in
   elevation of fish communities towards the river's head. This would
   enhance stress on species that rely on low water temperatures and coerce
   cyprinid species into advancing against retreating salmonids.
   Hyporhithral river sectors would turn into epipotamal sectors. Grayling
   (Thymallus thymallus) and Danube salmon (Hucho hucho), presently
   characteristic for the Mur River, would be superceded by other species.
   Native brown trout (Salmo trutta), already now under pressure of
   competition, may be at risk of losing its habitat in favour of invaders
   like the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which are better
   adapted to higher water temperatures. Projected changes in fish
   communities suggest an adverse influence on salmonid sport fishing and a
   loss in its high economic value.

AB The genetic control of the switch between seasonal and perpetual
   flowering has been deciphered in various perennial species. However,
   little is known about the genetic control of the dynamics of perpetual
   flowering, which changes abruptly at well-defined time instants during
   the growing season. Here, we characterize the perpetual flowering
   pattern and identify new genetic controls of this pattern in the
   cultivated strawberry. Twenty-one perpetual flowering strawberry
   genotypes were phenotyped at the macroscopic scale for their course of
   emergence of inflorescences and stolons during the growing season. A
   longitudinal analysis based on the segmentation of flowering rate
   profiles using multiple change-point models was conducted. The flowering
   pattern of perpetual flowering genotypes takes the form of three or four
   successive phases: an autumn-initiated flowering phase, a flowering
   pause, and a single stationary perpetual flowering phase or two
   perpetual flowering phases, the second one being more intense. The
   genetic control of flowering was analysed by quantitative trait locus
   mapping of flowering traits based on these flowering phases. We showed
   that the occurrence of a fourth phase of intense flowering is controlled
   by a newly identified locus, different from the locus FaPFRU,
   controlling the switch between seasonal and perpetual flowering
   behaviour. The role of this locus was validated by the analysis of data
   obtained previously during six consecutive years.

AB Background: Water availability is a major limiting factor for wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) production in rain-fed agricultural systems
   worldwide. Root system architecture has important functional
   implications for the timing and extent of soil water extraction, yet
   selection for root architectural traits in breeding programs has been
   limited by a lack of suitable phenotyping methods. The aim of this
   research was to develop low-cost high-throughput phenotyping methods to
   facilitate selection for desirable root architectural traits. Here, we
   report two methods, one using clear pots and the other using growth
   pouches, to assess the angle and the number of seminal roots in wheat
   seedlings-two proxy traits associated with the root architecture of
   mature wheat plants.
   Results: Both methods revealed genetic variation for seminal root angle
   and number in the panel of 24 wheat cultivars. The clear pot method
   provided higher heritability and higher genetic correlations across
   experiments compared to the growth pouch method. In addition, the clear
   pot method was more efficient - requiring less time, space, and labour
   compared to the growth pouch method. Therefore the clear pot method was
   considered the most suitable for large-scale and high-throughput
   screening of seedling root characteristics in crop improvement programs.
   Conclusions: The clear-pot method could be easily integrated in breeding
   programs targeting drought tolerance to rapidly enrich breeding
   populations with desirable alleles. For instance, selection for narrow
   root angle and high number of seminal roots could lead to deeper root
   systems with higher branching at depth. Such root characteristics are
   highly desirable in wheat to cope with anticipated future climate
   conditions, particularly where crops rely heavily on stored soil
   moisture at depth, including some Australian, Indian, South American,
   and African cropping regions.

AB In this study, a rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was
   used to determine the genetic characteristics of seed dormancy (SD) at 4
   (early), 5 (middle) and 6 (late) weeks after heading stages. Dynamic
   analysis showed that the indica IR28 variety tended to have deeper
   dormancy than the japonica Daguandao at the middle and late development
   stages. The level of SD decreased with the process of seed development.
   The significant interaction between heading date (HD) and SD occurred
   only in those seeds collected at the early development stage. A total of
   nine additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and eight epistatic QTLs
   for SD were identified at three seed development stages. Of them, one
   additive and four epistatic QTLs were identified for the early stage,
   six additive and one epistatic QTL for the middle stage and two additive
   and three epistatic QTLs for the late stage. The phenotypic variation
   explained by each additive and epistatic QTL ranged from 5.8 to 30.6 %
   and from 3.8 to 13.1 %, respectively. Compared with the additive QTLs,
   epistatic interactions were much more important for SD at the early and
   late development stages. Two major additive QTLs, qSD3.1 and qSD4.1,
   were identified; each QTL could explain more than 20 % of the total
   phenotypic variance and each dormancy-enhancing allele could decrease
   the germination percentage by about 10 %. By comparing the chromosomal
   positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, five
   additive QTLs, qSD1.2, qSD2.1, qSD3.2, qSD4.1 and qSD9.1, might
   represent novel genes. One QTL identified here, qHD1, and nine QTLs
   identified in previous studies for HD were co-located with our QTLs for
   SD, which indicated that the significant correlation between SD and HD
   might be due to the linkage of QTLs for SD and HD. Four RILs with deep
   dormancy at development stages but non-dormancy after post-ripening
   under different germination conditions were selected. Using the selected
   RILs, three cross combinations of SD for the development of RIL
   populations were predicted. The selected RILs and the identified QTLs
   might be applicable for the improvement of pre-harvest sprouting
   tolerance by marker-assisted selection in rice.

AB Intraspecific variation in characters such as arm sucker and gill
   lamellae counts in octopodids is yet to be thoroughly investigated,
   potentially hampering our ability to recognize species. In this study,
   data from 13 specimens of Muusoctopus hydrothermalis collected at four
   hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise between 8 degrees 38'N and
   12 degrees 48'N are considered. Although the northern and southern
   octopuses differ minimally in size, mean sucker count by arm in the
   northern group is 11.7 to 22.8% higher than it is in the southern group;
   in addition these octopuses typically have an additional gill lamella
   and bulkier funnel organs. The arms of each individual carry a different
   number of suckers. The difference is significant on nonadjacent arms, a
   pattern that merits examination in a broader taxonomic context. Why
   these differences exist among conspecifics remains unknown, the
   incidence of parasitic copepods is not different between the groups and
   the between-group variation in arm suckers seen here compares well with
   a previous report of variation among 18 specimens from the type
   locality. Increases in meristic characters (counts) in fish are
   attributed to lower temperatures during embryonic development following
   Jordan's rule. Northern and southern vents offer the octopuses a wide
   temperature range, but vent fluid chemistry differs. Northern vent
   fluids may be more toxic; if so, developing octopus embryos may survive
   only minimal vent fluid exposure and therefore develop at low
   temperatures. At the less toxic southern vents, eggs may survive greater
   exposure to vent fluids and thus develop at higher temperatures.

AB Measurement of metabolic rates (made at 10A degrees C) of individuals of

   distinct populations on sub-Antarctic Marion Island were combined with
   mitochondrial DNA (COI) haplotype analysis to examine in parallel both
   physiological and genetic variation of distinct populations. We found
   evidence of genetic differentiation among populations and a general
   indication of long-term isolation with limited gene flow. While we found
   support for an overall pattern of metabolic rate structure among
   populations from different geographic locations on the island (mean rate
   = 0.0009-0.0029 mu l O-2 mu g(-1) h(-1) for populations of a mean
   individual mass of 8-26 mu g), we were unable to demonstrate a coherent
   common pattern between this and genetic variation. However, spatial
   structure in metabolic rate variation was strongly related to the extent
   of variability in microclimate among sites, and also showed some
   indication of a phylogeographic signal. Thus, over the relatively short
   timescale of Marion Island's history (< 1 million years), the periodic
   geographic barriers that have driven population differentiation from a
   molecular perspective may also have resulted in some physiological
   differentiation of populations.

   period. Our goal was to determine whether environmentally explicit
   information could be used to infer the characteristics of individual
   larvae that are most likely to survive. Backward drift reconstruction
   was used to assess the influence of variations in the feeding
   environment on changes in the growth rates of individual larvae. Forward
   drift projections were used to assess the impact of predators on
   mortality rates as well as the cumulative density distribution of growth
   rates in the population of larvae in different areas of the bay. There
   was relatively little influence of current feeding conditions on
   increment widths. Patterns of selective mortality indicate that
   fast-growing individuals suffered higher mortality rates, suggesting
   they were growing into a predator's prey field. However, the mortality
   rates appeared to increase with decreasing predator abundance, based on
   the drift reconstructions. The relationship of growth and mortality with
   environmental conditions suggests that short-term, small-scale

   accurately in this relatively small system (similar to1000 km(2)).

AB We tested if species-rich fungal assemblages are functionally more
   efficient in leaf decomposition under environmental fluctuations than
   species-poor assemblages. We manipulated temperature fluctuations in
   laboratory microcosms in which oak leaf discs were inoculated with
   monocultures of aquatic hyphomycetes or random mixtures of three or
   eight species and subjected to different temperature regimes, including
   three constant temperatures and temperature fluctuation regimes.
   Temperature regime and identity of fungal species inoculated in
   monoculture microcosms significantly affected decomposition rates: these
   increased with temperature, but across all temperature regimes species
   diversity promoted higher decomposition rate, although functional
   saturation seemed to occur above three species. In assemblages with at
   least eight species, litter decomposition was not inhibited by
   temperature fluctuating regime when compared with constant temperature
   conditions. Ecosystem function under environmental changes seems to
   benefit from the presence of multiple species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and

AB We explored variability in the composition and cover of subtidal
   macroinvertebrate assemblages, and the recruitment and growth rates of
   selected invertebrate species, on seven offshore oil and gas platforms
   arrayed across a gradient in oceanographic conditions in the Santa
   Barbara Channel, CA, USA. The major macroinvertebrate taxa (sea
   anemones, mussels, barnacles, tubiculous amphipods, hydroids, and
   sponges) were common to all platforms. However, discriminant function
   analysis (DFA) revealed that the assemblages of two platforms (Gilda and
   Gail) clearly differed from the other platforms, a pattern attributable,
   in part, to the presence of conspicuous exotic species (the anemone,
   Diadumene sp., and encrusting bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata) on
   these platforms. If these exotic species were excluded from the
   analysis, platforms in proximity to each other generally tended to have
   invertebrate assemblages more similar to each other than to platforms
   located farther away. Spatial variation in barnacle recruitment onto
   ceramic plates and mussel growth rate reflected prevailing oceanographic
   gradients. The existence of along-channel patterns in the composition of
   platform invertebrate assemblages, and in invertebrate recruitment and
   growth associated with oceanographic gradients, suggests that
   assemblages attached to platforms or other artificial structures may be
   useful barometers of short and perhaps longer term change in ocean
   climate.

AB The Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil has been considered to have
   the highest number of tree species per hectare in the world. Assessing
   the influence of climate on tropical tree species is a priority in the
   face of ongoing climate change, and for which dendrochronological
   studies have been important. We address the dendrochronological
   potential of Licaria bahiana Kurz (Lauraceae), an endemic species of the
   Atlantic forests. We studied growth ring anatomy of L. bahiana and
   applied dendrochronological methods to investigate how short-term
   variation in climate affect its radial growth. Distinct growth rings
   were observed in all individuals and demarcated by darker tangential
   fiber zones in latewood. Trees showed high climatic sensitivity (0.48)
   and growth synchrony (intercorrelation r = 0.69; rbar = 0.38). Radial
   growth was negatively influenced by high temperatures at the beginning
   of the current growing season (r = -0.46) and by excessive rainfall at
   the end of the current growing season (r = -0.29), which are periods
   that correspond to the phenological reproductive phases of the species.
   Climate anomalies during this period may alter the tradeoff between
   growth and reproduction, in favor of the latter.

AB Individual differences in behavior may strongly shape life-history
   trajectories. However, few empirical studies to date have investigated
   the link between behavioral traits and fitness, especially in wild
   populations. We measured the impact of coping style in female roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) on early survival of their offspring.
   Specifically, we expected offspring of proactive mothers, which should
   be more mobile and aggressive, to survive better than those of reactive
   females, which should be more passive and react less in stressful
   contexts. To test this prediction, we accounted for confounding effects
   of variation in early survival linked to habitat heterogeneity, as we
   also expected bed-site selection to impact fawn survival. Fawn survival
   was highly dependent on the interaction between habitat use and the
   coping style of the mother. As expected, fawns of proactive mothers
   survived better in open habitats. However, unexpectedly, fawns of
   reactive mothers had the highest survival in closed habitats. Our
   findings provide clear evidence that interindividual differences in the
   coping style of the mother can markedly impact early offspring survival
   and, thereby, female fitness, in wild populations of mammals. Moreover,
   we provide evidence that fitness consequences of copying styles are
   habitat-dependent, providing a possible mechanism for the maintenance of
   within-population variation in behavior.

AB The prediction of suicidal behavior is a complex task. To fine-tune
   targeted preventative interventions, predictive analytics (i.e.
   forecasting future risk of suicide) is more important than exploratory
   data analysis (pattern recognition, e.g. detection of seasonality in
   suicide time series). This study sets out to investigate the accuracy of
   forecasting models of suicide for men and women. A total of 101 499 male
   suicides and of 39 681 female suicides - occurred in Italy from 1969 to
   2003 - were investigated. In order to apply the forecasting model and
   test its accuracy, the time series were split into a training set (1969
   to 1996; 336 months) and a test set (1997 to 2003; 84 months). The main
   outcome was the accuracy of forecasting models on the monthly number of
   suicides. These measures of accuracy were used: mean absolute error;
   root mean squared error; mean absolute percentage error; mean absolute
   scaled error. In both male and female suicides a change in the trend
   pattern was observed, with an increase from 1969 onwards to reach a
   maximum around 1990 and decrease thereafter. The variances attributable
   to the seasonal and trend components were, respectively, 24% and 64% in
   male suicides, and 28% and 41% in female ones. Both annual and seasonal
   historical trends of monthly data contributed to forecast future trends
   of suicide with a margin of error around 10%. The finding is clearer in
   male than in female time series of suicide. The main conclusion of the
   study is that models taking seasonality into account seem to be able to
   derive information on deviation from the mean when this occurs as a
   zenith, but they fail to reproduce it when it occurs as a nadir.
   Preventative efforts should concentrate on the factors that influence
   the occurrence of increases above the main trend in both seasonal and
   cyclic patterns of suicides.

   explore the climate signal at the high- and low-elevation sites and
   assess the effects of varying temperature and precipitation regimes on
   MXD formation. Ranging from spring temperature to summer precipitation,
   the elevation-specific climate sensitivity suggests that the MXD

AB Models which explore the possibilities of emergent self-regulation in
   the Earth system often assume the timescales associated with changes in
   various sub-systems to be predetermined. Given their importance in
   guiding the fixed point dynamics of such models, relatively little
   formalism has been established. We analyse a classic model of
   environmental self-regulation, Daisyworld, and interpret the original
   equations for model temperature, changes in insolation, and
   self-organisation of the biota as an important separation of timescales.
   This allows a simple analytical solution where the model is reduced to
   two states while retaining important characteristics of the original
   model. We explore the consequences of relaxing some key assumptions. We
   show that increasing the rate of change of insolation relative to
   adaptation of the biota shows a sharp transition between regulating, and
   lifeless states. Additionally, in slowing the rate of model temperature
   change relative to the adapting biota we derive expressions for the
   damping rate of fluctuations, along with a threshold beyond which damped
   oscillations occur. We relax the assumption that seeding occurs globally
   by extending this analysis to solve a two-dimensional cellular automata
   Daisyworld. We conclude by reviewing a number of previous Daisyworld
   models and make explicit their respective timescales, and how their
   behaviour can be understood in light of our analysis. (C) 2012 Published

AB The aim of this study was to investigate, during the summer of the year
   2008, the variation in leaf water and photosynthetic characteristics of
   Eucryphia cordifolia Cav. (Cunoniaceae) along its broad latitudinal
   distribution in central south Chile (36 degrees to 42 degrees S). The
   latitudinal variation in water potential (Psi(w)), water potential at
   saturation (Psi pi(sat)), water potential at the turgor lost point (Psi
   pi(tlp)), stomatal density of the leaves, leaf nitrogen concentrations
   and photosynthetic light response were studied in eight populations. The
   populations located in the northern region of the distribution of E.
   cordifolia had the lowest leaf water potential. Osmotic potential at
   full turgor was highest in the two southernmost populations and
   gradually decreased towards the northernmost points. Similarly, osmotic
   potential at zero turgor was the lowest in the northern population. On
   the contrary, the symplastic water content was lower in the two
   southernmost populations. The highest net photosynthesis rate was
   recorded for plants in the populations of intermediate distributions,
   and it was dependent on the precipitation and temperature gradient. The
   northern populations, which are subject to the lowest precipitations,
   showed the lowest stomatal densities, which were tightly linked with
   stomatal conductance variation. Therefore, the variability of A(max) was
   independent of stomatal density and conductance, so that the northern
   populations, subject to environments with less water availability,
   presented higher photosynthetic water use efficiency. Photosynthesis
   variations were also not associated with changes in leaf water potential
   or in nitrogen content in E. cordifolia leaves, which did not show any
   consistent latitudinal or altitudinal trend. In conclusion, the results
   support our hypothesis that the leaf water relations, stomatal
   characteristics and photosynthetic rates of the leaf would vary along
   its latitudinal gradient, helping to explain the ability of E.
   cordifolia trees to inhabit a broad latitudinal and altitudinal range
   throughout the central south Chile.

AB Chub mackerel Scomber japonicas is an economically important fish
   species, extensively distributed in the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea
   and the Sea of Japan. Climate variability has strong impacts on its
   habitat. In this study, an integrated habitat suitability index (HSI)
   model was constructed to examine habitat suitability of S. japonicas in
   the East China Sea, and evaluate the relationship with the El Nino and
   La Nina events, with three crucial environmental variables (sea surface
   temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH) and net primary production
   (NPP)) as predictors. The HSI model was developed using data over
   2006-2013 and validated using data in 2014 and 2015. Results showed that
   the HSI model with the best model performance yielded robust predictions
   of habitat suitability for S. japonicas. The decreasing catch and CPUE
   (catch per unit effort) of S. japonicus during 2006-2015 were highly
   consistent with substantial shrinkage of suitable and optimal habitats,
   and enlargement of normal and poor habitats. Similar movement pattern
   was also found between the latitudinal gravity centers of fishing effort
   for S. japonicas fishery and the gravity centers of potential habitat.
   In addition, spatial correlation analysis indicated that the HSI value
   was significantly positively related to the SST anomaly (SSTA) and
   negatively correlated with the SSH anomaly (SSHA) and NPP anomaly
   (NPPA), on the main fishing ground between 25 degrees-30 degrees N and
   120 degrees-130 degrees E. Furthermore, various intensity of the El Nino
   and La Nina event may lead to different variations in the habitat
   suitability of S. japonicus. Comparing to the very strong El Nino, the
   moderate El Nitio events would yield rising SSTA and lowing SSHA and
   NPPA, leading to dramatically enlarged suitable habitat of S. japonicas.
   The habitat quality in La Nina events with different intensity depended
   on the local environmental variability on the fishing ground. Our
   findings suggested that the El Nino and La Nina events prominently
   affected the habitat suitability of S. japonicas in the East China Sea.
   However, the impacts varied with the intensity of each anomalous
   climatic event.

   photosynthetic pigment variability in visibly healthy Porites lobata and
   Porites lutea corals from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and explored whether
   pigment variability was related to the genetic identity or phenotypic
   characteristics of the symbionts. Concentrations of the photosynthetic
   pigments chlorophyll a, peridinin, chlorophyll c(2) , diadinoxanthin,
   diatoxanthin, beta,beta-carotene and dinoxanthin were quantified using
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pigment concentrations
   were found to range 1.5-10 fold in colonies of each species at similar
   depths (0-2, 2-4, 10-15 and 19-21 m). Despite the high pigment
   variability, pigment ratios for each species were relatively conserved
   over the 0-21 m depth gradient. The genetic identity of the symbiont
   communities was examined for each colony using 18S nuclear ribosomal DNA
   (nrDNA) restriction fragment length polymorphisms. All colonies
   contained symbionts belonging to clade C. The density and phenotypic
   characteristics of the symbionts were explored using flow cytometry, and
   fluorescence and side scatter (cell size) properties revealed
   phenotypically distinct symbiont subpopulations in every colony. The
   symbiont subpopulations displayed pigment trends that may be driven by
   acclimatization to irradiance microenvironments within the host. These
   results highlight the biological complexity of healthy coral-symbiont
   associations and the need for future research on pigments and symbiont
   subpopulation dynamics.

   We then measured the proportion of the modeled envelope that is
   currently occupied by the species, as a metric of equilibrium of species
   distributions with climate. The assumption was that the greater the
   difference between modeled bioclimatic envelope and the occupied
   distribution, the greater the likelihood that species distribution would
   not be at equilibrium with contemporary climate. On average, amphibians
   occupied 30% to 57% of their potential distributions. Although patterns
   differed across regions, there were no significant differences among
   lineages. Species in the Neotropic, Afrotropics, Indo-Malay, and
   Palaearctic occupied a smaller proportion of their potential
   distributions than species in the Nearctic, Madagascar, and Australasia.
   We acknowledge that our models underestimate non equilibrium, and
   discuss potential reasons for the observed patterns. From a modeling
   perspective our results support the view that at global scale
   bioclimatic envelope models might perform similarly across lineages but
   differently across regions.

AB 1. Many aphids form mixed populations of cyclical and obligate
   parthenogens. This is puzzling, because all else being equal, obligate
   parthenogens should outcompete cyclical parthenogens due to the two-fold
   cost of sex. Yet cyclical parthenogens produce frost-resistant,
   diapausing eggs in autumn, while obligate parthenogens spend the winter
   as active stages. Frost resistance thus represents a short-term
   advantage to sexual reproduction mediated by winter temperatures, which
   may promote this coexistence.
   2. Because obligate parthenogens overwinter as active stages, there may
   be selection for increased cold tolerance compared to cyclical
   parthenogens. This has the potential to gradually erode the advantage of
   sexually producing eggs.
   3. Four obligately and four cyclically parthenogenetic lines of Myzus
   persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were collected from each of two
   areas differing in winter severity, and their survival after exposure to
   a severe experimental frost (14 h at -9 degreesC), as well as their
   reproductive performance at a low (10 degreesC) and a high (20 degreesC)
   temperature were compared.
   4. There was significant variation among lines in survival after the
   experimental frost, but this variation was neither related to their
   reproductive mode, nor to their area of origin. Similarly, neither
   reproductive mode nor origin had a significant effect on reproductive
   performance, independent of temperature. The average slope of the
   response to variation in temperature was also similar for both
   reproductive modes, despite the fact that slopes differed significantly
   among lines.
   5. Within the limits of extrapolating from laboratory experiments, it is
   concluded that in M. persicae, the active stages of obligate
   parthenogens are not better adapted to cold temperatures than those of
   cyclical parthenogens.

AB Cold-induced mortality is a key factor driving mountain pine beetle,
   Dendroctonus ponderosae, population dynamics. In this species, the
   supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute
   cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced
   mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior
   to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D.
   ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated
   phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the
   SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the
   temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold
   tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in
   three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an
   intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their
   gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible
   from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have
   accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol).
   Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response
   to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss
   of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the
   model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good
   agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model
   predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season,
   among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local
   climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has
   important implications for understanding the insect's response to
   seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to
   climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several
   major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we
   suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the
   insect's biology. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the factors that determine community diversity is a
   central focus of ecology and has important implications for conservation
   and management. We investigated how the local movement of a dynamic
   front between 2 opposing water masses influenced subtidal invertebrate
   settlement rates and settlement diversity along the north coastline of
   Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. Using data from artificial
   collectors deployed twice per month in 2008 and 2009, we characterized
   larval settlement of ecologically and commercially important marine
   invertebrates. We also tracked movement of the front throughout the
   collection period by analyzing variation in sea temperature at sampling
   sites. Settlement rates of multiple species of bivalves, gastropods,
   decapods, and echinoderms were positively associated with the proportion
   of time a given site spent in a particular water mass. Overall
   settlement diversity was also related to front location over time, as
   sites that were exposed to both water masses had higher overall
   diversity. These results suggest that front movement has a significant
   impact on settlement and community structure. We also found that these
   effects applied at several levels of taxonomic resolution, suggesting
   that our findings are robust to varying levels of identification.
   Dynamic boundaries may impact overall regional biogeography and
   community connectivity and lead to communities in the area of front
   movement having higher levels of diversity. Thus the scale of
   oceanographic circulation patterns should be considered in conservation
   and management planning efforts focused on conserving diversity (e.g.
   the placement of marine protected areas) and in studies of marine
   population dynamics.

AB As a contribution to conservation, we investigated germination
   requirements of three perennial, endangered river corridor plants of
   Central European lowlands coexisting in subcontinental flood meadows,
   but preferring particular zones of decreasing flooding frequency and
   duration along the elevational gradient of the banks. It was
   hypothesized that the species have specific germination requirements to
   respond successfully to open patch creation depending on their
   occurrence along the gradient of spring flooding in the field. This
   study involved controlled experiments and phenological studies. Juncus
   atratus and Gratiola officinalis, which frequently occupy flooded,
   naturally disturbed sites, have an absolute light requirement for
   germination, typical of pioneer species. Summer-dispersed, non-dormant
   seeds off. atratus did hardly germinate at high temperatures and lacked
   a gap sensitivity based on temperature fluctuation. Since the
   temperature amplitude decreases beneath an insulating cover of
   vegetation or water, seeds seem to be prepared for rapid germination at
   open, wet, maybe even inundated sites. Late-summer-dispersed seeds of G.
   officinalis were in a state of conditional primary dormancy. Dormancy
   could be completely broken by cold-wet stratification, indicating spring
   germination. Similar to J. atratus, daily temperature fluctuations did
   not control germination at suitable microsites. In Cnidium dubium that
   occurs at higher elevated sites, the level of primary dormancy of seeds
   was sufficient to prevent germination following dispersal, but the level
   was dependent on the year of harvest. Buried seeds showed an annual
   dormancy/conditional dormancy cycle. Dormancy was only partially broken
   by cold-wet stratification. It was completely broken by application of a
   high concentration of gibberellic acid. C. dubium had no absolute light
   requirement for germination, but it was stimulated by high light levels
   and in contrast to the other two species, seeds were stimulated by daily
   temperature fluctuations. Germination would therefore be maximized by
   zaps in early spring when the flooding water has receded. Re-entering
   dormancy in the late spring fails to support that germination occurs
   immediately after early-summer mowing - an important factor at
   subcontinental flood meadows. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

AB Theory suggests that heterogeneous environments should maintain more
   genetic variation within populations than homogeneous environments, yet
   experimental evidence for this effect in quantitative traits has been
   inconsistent. To examine the effect of heterogeneity on quantitative
   genetic variation, we maintained replicate populations of Drosophila
   melanogaster under treatments with constant temperatures, temporally
   variable temperature, or spatially variable temperature with either
   panmictic or limited migration. Despite observing differences in fitness
   and divergence in several wing traits between the environments, we did
   not find any differences in the additive genetic variance for any wing
   traits among any of the treatments. Although we found an effect of gene
   flow constraining adaptive divergence between cages in the limited
   migration treatment, it did not tend to increase within-population
   genetic variance relative to any of the other treatments. The lack of
   any clear and repeatable patterns of response to heterogeneous versus
   homogeneous environments across several empirical studies suggests that
   a single general mechanism for the maintenance of standing genetic
   variation is unlikely; rather, the relative importance of putative
   mechanisms likely varies considerably from one trait and ecological
   context to another.

AB Migratory species with a broad geographic range, such as north-east
   Atlantic mackerel, may be amongst the fauna most able to respond to
   warming seas, typically with a poleward shift in range. Habitat
   heterogeneity could, however, produce more complex patterns than a
   simple polewards translation in distribution. We tested for changes in
   the central location and spatial spread of mackerel spawning over a
   33-year period. Spatial statistics [centre of gravity (CoG) of egg
   production, spatial variance, and degree of anisotropy] were used to
   summarise interannual changes in the spawning locations of the western
   spawning stock of north-east Atlantic mackerel (NEA-WSC) using data from
   the ICES triennial egg survey. A northwards shift in CoG of egg
   production estimates was observed, related to both an expansion in the
   distribution in survey effort and warming waters of the north-east
   Atlantic. Sea surface temperature (SST) had a significant positive
   association with the observed northward movement of NEA-WSC mackerel,
   equivalent to a displacement of 37.7 km A degrees C-1 (based on spring
   mean SST for the region). The spatial distribution of spawning around
   the CoG also changed significantly with SST, with a less elongated
   spatial spread in warm years. An increase in the proportion of spawning
   over the Porcupine Bank demonstrated how habitat interacts with
   positional shifts to affect how north-east Atlantic mackerel are
   distributed around the centre of their spawning range.

AB I compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance of five
   populations of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) over a
   wide geographic range extending from the cool-temperate south to the
   tropical north of Australia. Maximum jumping performance of adult E
   peronii was assessed for each population at eight temperatures between
   5degreesC and 32degreesC using a custom-designed force platform. From
   force recordings for each individual jump, maximum jumping force (F-max)
   and acceleration (A(max)) and maximum power output (P-max), take-off
   velocity (U-max), jump distance (D-J) and contact time on the platform
   (T-C) were calculated. The body mass of adult E peronii varied over
   their geographic range, from approximately 5 g for the lowland tropical
   population to more than 22 g for the cool-temperate populations. The
   thermal sensitivity of jumping performance varied over their geographic
   range, with the populations from the cooler climates generally
   performing better than those from the warmer climate populations at the
   cooler temperatures, and vice versa at the higher temperatures. However,
   not all parameters of jumping performance underwent parallel changes in
   thermal sensitivity amongst the populations of L. peronii. Only minor
   differences in the shape of the thermal sensitivity curves for F-max and
   A(max) were detected amongst the populations, while the thermal
   sensitivities of U-max, D-J and P-max all displayed considerable
   variation amongst the populations. The optimal temperatures for U-max,
   D-J and P-max were generally lower in the cool-temperate populations
   than in the tropical populations of L. peronii. To determine whether
   this geographic variation was due to genetic variation, or merely
   reflected phenotypic plasticity, I also compared the thermal sensitivity
   of jumping performance between metamorph L. peronii from two different
   populations raised under identical conditions in the laboratory. The
   maximum jumping distance of the metamorph L. peronii was assessed at
   seven temperatures between 8degreesC and 35degreesC for the two
   latitudinally extreme populations (i.e. lowland tropical Proserpine and
   cool-temperate Gippsland populations). Like adult L. peronii, the
   metamorphs from the cool-temperate population jumped further than those
   from the lowland tropical population at the lower temperatures, although
   no differences were detected at the higher temperatures. Thus,
   geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in L.
   peronii probably has a genetic component, and the different populations
   appear to have undergone genetic adaptation of their thermal sensitivity
   to the varied thermal environments.

AB A predictive model for Salmonella spp. growth in ground pork was
   developed and validated using kinetic growth data. Salmonella spp.
   kinetic growth data in ground pork were collected at several isothermal
   conditions (between 10 and 45 degrees C) and Baranyi model was fitted to
   describe the growth at each temperature, separately. The maximum growth
   rates (mu(max)) estimated from the Baranyi model were modeled as a
   function of temperature using a modified Ratkowsky equation. To estimate
   bacterial growth under dynamic temperature conditions, the differential
   form of the Baranyi model, in combination with the modified Ratkowsky
   equation for rate constants, was solved numerically using fourth order
   Runge-Kutta method. The dynamic model was validated using five different
   dynamic temperature profiles (linear cooling, exponential cooling,
   linear heating, exponential heating, and sinusoidal). Performance
   measures, root mean squared error, accuracy factor, and bias factor were
   used to evaluate the model performance, and were observed to be
   satisfactory. The dynamic model can estimate the growth of Salmonella
   spp. in pork within a 0.5 log accuracy under both linear and exponential
   cooling profiles, although the model may overestimate or underestimate
   at some data points, which were generally < 1 log. Under sinusoidal
   temperature profiles, the estimates from the dynamic model were also
   within 0.5 log of the observed values. However, underestimation could
   occur if the bacteria were exposed to temperatures below the minimum
   growth temperature of Salmonella spp., since low temperature conditions
   could alter the cell physiology. To obtain an accurate estimate of
   Salmonella spp. growth using the models reported in this work, it is
   suggested that the models be used at temperatures above 7 degrees C, the
   minimum growth temperature for Salmonella spp. in pork. (C) 2010

   Variation of this abiotic factor across geographic gradients is expected
   to produce physiological differentiation and local adaptation of natural

   sensitivities. Here, we studied geographic variation in whole-organism
   thermal physiology of seven populations of the porcelain crab
   Petrolisthes violaceus across a latitudinal gradient of 3000 km,
   characterized by a cline of thermal conditions. Our study found that
   populations of P. violaceus show no differences in the limits of their
   thermal performance curves and demonstrate a negative correlation of
   their optimal temperatures with latitude. Additionally, our findings
   show that high-latitude populations of P. violaceus exhibit broader
   thermal tolerances, which is consistent with the climatic variability
   hypothesis. Interestingly, under a future scenario of warming oceans,
   the thermal safety margins of P. violaceus indicate that lower latitude
   populations can physiologically tolerate the ocean-warming scenarios
   projected by the IPCC for the end of the twenty-first century.

AB Predicting insect field performance has direct value for control
   programmes seeking increased efficacy while simultaneously providing
   insights into field physiology and responses to environmental
   variability. Recent studies of field-released insects have made
   significant progress in three main areas. First, the trade-offs
   associated with thermal history relative to abiotic conditions on a
   given day have been repeatedly demonstrated in several taxa.
   Cold-acclimated insects released into hotter environments typically
   suffer performance costs - but do better than controls - in cooler
   environments suggesting both costs and benefits to physiological
   adjustments. Second, molecular mechanisms explored to date suggest
   complex underlying associations with recapture rates. Third, there has
   been significant progress in strengthening the link between traits
   scored in the laboratory as indicators of field performance. The
   overarching conclusion from this developing field suggests that
   physiological adjustments can make large, and in at least several cases,
   predictable changes in performance under field conditions. Further
   research is likely to contribute important insights into variation in
   field performance of insects.

AB The kinetic properties of photosynthesis (both transient and
   steady-state) were monitored using three non-invasive techniques to
   evaluate limitations on triose-phosphate (triose-P) conversion to
   carbohydrate in rice. These included analyzing the O-2 sensitivity of
   CO2 fixation and the assimilatory charge (AC) using gas exchange
   (estimate of the ribulose 1,5- bisphosphate pool) and measuring
   Photosystem II activity by chlorophyll fluorescence analysis under
   varying light, temperature and CO2 partial pressures. Photosynthesis was
   inhibited transiently upon switching from 20 to 2 kPa O-2 (reversed O-2
   sensitivity), the degree of which was correlated with a terminal,
   steady-state suppression of low O-2 enhancement of photosynthesis. Under
   current ambient levels of CO2 and moderate to high light, the transient
   pattern was more obvious at 18 degrees C than at 26 degrees C while at
   34 degrees C no transient response was observed. The transient
   inhibition at 18 degrees C ranged from 15% to 31% depending on the
   pre-measurement temperature. This pattern, symptomatic of feedback, was
   observed with increasing light and CO2 partial pressures with the degree
   of feedback decreasing from moderate (18 degrees C) up to high
   temperature (34 degrees C). Under feedback conditions, the rate of
   assimilation is shifted from being photorespiration limited to being
   triose-P utilization limited. Transitory changes in CO2 assimilation
   rates (A) under low O-2 indicative of feedback coincided with a
   transitory drop in assimilatory charge (AC) and inhibition of electron
   transport. In contrast to previous studies with many C-3 species, our
   studies indicate that rice shows susceptibility to feedback inhibition
   under moderate temperatures and current atmospheric levels of CO2.

   in different locations and environments, from upper to lower treelines,
   and from wet maritime sites at the Pacific to the subcontinental
   interior of the peninsula. Response functions were calculated using the
   four longest meteorological records (1920s-2000) in Kamchatka. In Betula
   ermanu Cham, the dominant species in mountains and maritime woodlands,
   ring width in high-elevation (500-600 m) trees increased with warm and
   less rainy June and July and decreased with rainy/snowy cool weather
   during the prior September and October Radial growth in B ermanii
   low-elevation trees increased with higher winter precipitation,
   suggesting that water from inching snow prevents water stress and

   temperatures limited growth at its upper distributional limit (300-350
   m) and in cool, wet sites dominated by Picea ajanensis Lindl. et Gord On
   drier sites dominated by Lam cajanderu Mayr growth was limited by warm

AB Backgrounds and Aims Identification of physiological traits associated
   with leaf photosynthetic rate (P-n) is important for improving potential
   productivity of rice (Oryza sativa). The objectives of this study were
   to develop a model which can explain genotypic variation and ontogenetic
   change of P-n in rice under optimal conditions as a function of leaf
   nitrogen content per unit area (N) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), and
   to quantify the effects of interaction between N and g(s) on the
   variation of P-n.
   Methods P-n, N and g(s) were measured at different developmental stages
   for the topmost fully expanded leaves in ten rice genotypes with diverse
   backgrounds grown in pots (2002) and in the field (2001 and 2002). A
   model of P-n that accounts for carboxylation and CO2 diffusion
   processes, and assumes that the ratio of internal conductance to g(s) is
   constant, was constructed, and its goodness of fit was examined.
   Key Results Considerable genotypic differences in P-n were evident for
   rice throughout development in both the pot and field experiments. The
   genotypic variation of P-n was correlated with that of g(s) at a given
   stage, and the change of P-n with plant development was closely related
   to the change of N. The variation of g(s) among genotypes was
   independent of that of N. The model explained well the variation in P-n
   of the ten genotypes grown under different conditions at different
   developmental stages.
   Conclusions The response of P-n to increased N differs with g(s), and
   the increase in P-n of genotypes with low gs is smaller than that of
   genotypes with high g(s). Therefore, simultaneous improvements of these
   two traits are essential for an effective breeding of rice genotypes
   with increased P-n.

AB Learning and memory allow animals to adjust their foraging strategies
   through experience. Despite the known impact of temperature on many
   aspects of the behavioral ecology of animals, memory retention in the
   face of realistic thermal stress has seldom been assessed. In the
   laboratory, we studied the behavioral expression of an egg parasitoid's
   (Trissolcus basalis) memory when exposed to thermal stress that could be
   encountered in nature. We hypothesized that thermal stress would disrupt
   memory consolidation and/or modify the optimality of memory retention,
   thus affecting patch time allocation strategies. Memory consolidation
   was resilient to 1 h of thermal stress following an unrewarded
   experience (learning) on a patch of host-associated infochemicals.
   Neither high (40 degrees C) or low (10 degrees C) thermal stress changed
   the intensity of the experienced wasps' behavioral response relative to
   those held at a moderate temperature (25 degrees C). Next, we
   investigated how temperature stress could affect the parasitoids' memory
   retention ("forgetting"). When kept at a constant moderate temperature
   after learning, residence times of wasps retested on host cues increased
   relative to controls (naive wasps) over a period of 4 days as they
   presumably "forgot." However, both hot and cool daily temperature cycles
   prevented forgetting; the residence times of retested experienced wasps
   in these treatments did not change relative to controls over time. We
   discuss to what extent this may be an adaptive response by the
   parasitoids versus a physiological constraint imposed by temperature.
   Our findings contribute to an understanding of the impact of thermal
   stress on foraging strategies that involve learning and memory.

AB 1. A spatially-extensive data set of stream macroinvertebrate
   communities from 49 northern New Zealand sites sampled over a 10-year
   period was analysed to assess relationships between the environment
   (catchment land-cover, landscape position and regional-scale weather
   patterns), and (i) community persistence and stability based on the
   constancy of species occurrence (presence-absence) and abundance (per
   cent composition), respectively and (ii) the temporal variability of
   various community condition metrics.
   2. No significant relationship was evident between community stability
   or persistence within sites and a gradient of increasing land-use stress
   (LUS) based on types of upstream land-cover, with interannual mean
   similarities at all sites falling within the standard deviations
   recorded at long-term reference sites. In contrast, condition metrics
   were inversely related to LUS. Land-use appeared to be a key factor
   influencing community composition among sites whereas climate influenced
   stability and persistence within sites.
   3. Three response trajectories of community variability to increasing
   LUS were distinguished based on the coefficient of variation of mean
   interannual similarities, such that (i) persistence and stability
   appeared to be more variable at developed sites with low LUS and at
   sites with high stress relative to the variability experienced
   naturally, but similar to the natural range at intermediate levels of
   stress ('sinusoidal response'); (ii) variability in Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera and Trichoptera metrics increased at low-to-moderate stress
   and then accelerated rapidly at highly developed sites
   ('stepped-exponential response') and (iii) variability in a pollution
   tolerance metric increased rapidly and then maintained a similar level
   of variability along the remaining stress gradient ('plateau response').
   4. The results of this study have implications for biomonitoring
   approaches that assume high temporal persistence and stability of
   communities to define site impairment. Misclassifications caused by
   interannual variability could lead to misinterpretation of site
   condition, if conclusions are based on single annual surveys. Temporal
   variability in stability and persistence may help distinguish low levels
   of impairment where a predominantly healthy fauna experiences increased
   environmental fluctuations.

AB Accurate predictions of the timing and magnitude of consumer responses
   to episodic seeding events (masts) are important for understanding
   ecosystem dynamics and for managing outbreaks of invasive species
   generated by masts. While models relating consumer populations to
   resource fluctuations have been developed successfully for a range of
   natural and modified ecosystems, a critical gap that needs addressing is
   better prediction of resource pulses. A recent model used change in
   summer temperature from one year to the next (Delta T) for predicting
   masts for forest and grassland plants in New Zealand. We extend this
   climate-based method in the framework of a model for consumer-resource
   dynamics to predict invasive house mouse (Mus musculus) outbreaks in
   forest ecosystems. Compared with previous mast models based on absolute
   temperature, the Delta T method for predicting masts resulted in an
   improved model for mouse population dynamics. There was also a threshold
   effect of Delta T on the likelihood of an outbreak occurring. The
   improved climate-based method for predicting resource pulses and
   consumer responses provides a straightforward rule of thumb for
   determining, with one year's advance warning, whether management
   intervention might be required in invaded ecosystems. The approach could
   be applied to consumer-resource systems worldwide where climatic
   variables are used to model the size and duration of resource pulses,
   and may have particular relevance for ecosystems where global change
   scenarios predict increased variability in climatic events.

AB Background and Aims Germination and heterotrophic growth are crucial
   steps for stand establishment. Numerical experiments based on the
   modelling of these early stages in relation to major environmental
   factors at sowing were used as a powerful tool to browse the effects of
   the genetic diversity of Medicago truncatula, one of the model legume
   species, under a range of agronomic scenarios, and to highlight the most
   important plant parameters for emergence. To this end, the emergence of
   several genotypes of M. truncatula was simulated under a range of sowing
   conditions with a germination and emergence simulation model.
   Methods After testing the predictive quality of the model by comparing
   simulations to field observations of several genotypes of M. truncatula,
   numerical experiments were performed under a wide range of environmental
   conditions (sowing dates x years x seedbed structure). Germination and
   emergence was simulated for a set of five genotypes previously
   parameterized and for two virtual genotypes engineered to maximize the
   potential effects of genetic diversity.
   Key Results The simulation results gave an average value of 5-10 %
   difference in final emergence between genotypes, which was low, but the
   analysis underlined considerable inter-annual variation. The effects of
   parameters describing germination and emergence processes were
   quantified and ranked according to their contribution to the variation
   in emergence. Seedling non-emergence was mainly related to mechanical
   obstacles (40-50 %). More generally, plant parameters that accelerated
   the emergence time course significantly contributed to limiting the risk
   of soil surface crusting occurring before seedling emergence.
   Conclusions The model-assisted analysis of the effects of genetic
   diversity demonstrated its usefulness in helping to identify the
   parameters which have most influence that could be improved by breeding
   programmes. These results should also enable a deeper analysis of the
   genetic determinism of the main plant parameters influencing emergence,
   using the genomic tools available for this model plant.

   over the crop-growing season (kharif, rabi, and zaid) and annual
   frequencies of temperature extremes over India. The direction and

   Mann-Kendall statistics (alpha = 0.05) and further assessed at the
   homogeneous temperature regions using a field significance test
   (alpha=0.05). General warming trends were observed over India with
   considerable variations in direction and magnitude over space and time.
   The spatial extent and the magnitude of the increasing trends of minimum
   temperature (0.02-0.04 A degrees C year(-1)) were found to be higher
   than that of maximum temperature (0.01-0.02 A degrees C year(-1)) during
   winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Significant negative trends of minimum
   temperature were found over eastern India during the monsoon months.
   Such trends were also observed for the maximum temperature over northern
   and eastern parts, particularly in the winter month of January. The
   general warming patterns also changed the thermal environment of the
   crop-growing season causing significant increase in GDDs during kharif
   and rabi seasons across India. The warming climate has also caused
   significant increase in occurrences of hot extremes such as hot days and
   hot nights, and significant decrease in cold extremes such as cold days
   and cold nights.

AB Pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), diatoms, and geochemistry of
   lake sediments with partially preserved annual lamination were used to
   reconstruct post-glacial environmental changes of northern Poland in the
   Baltic region. The main stages in the lake's evolution indicate the
   following: (1) eutrophic conditions in the final stage of the
   Lateglacial, (2) very low trophy and strongly changeable water levels in
   the early Holocene, (3) slowly rising trophy through the mid- and late
   Holocene enabling persistence of the oligotrophic state of the lake up
   to c. AD 1450, (4) strong cultural eutrophication of the lake in the
   recent period (c. 150 years), and (5) maximum Ca content in the early
   Holocene followed by a gradual decline to minimum values in recent time.
   Distinct, concurrent shifts in limnological proxies and tree pollen
   accumulation rates (PARs) enabled the identification of several
   potential Holocene cool climatic events of different magnitudes and
   durations. Strong reduction in Tetraedron minimum and declines in tree
   PARs illustrate limitation of physiological processes in plants, which
   could result from shorter growing seasons and lower summer temperatures
   and insolation. Higher precipitation of Fe and Mn indicates more
   intensive weathering in the catchment, while peaks in Fe/Mn ratio and
   concurrent drops in Ca content suggest at least seasonal anoxia, which
   could result from a longer duration of ice cover and shorter periods of
   mixing. The data seem to display striking conformity of the main cooling
   events with the "Bond cycles" (Bond et al., 1997, 2001), but also
   indicate a more variable pattern that may reflect traces of a more
   complex cyclicity of climatic shifts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby
   leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize
   photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term
   changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of
   plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for
   photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood.
   A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was
   combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation
   profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (Triticum
   aestivum) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted
   to predict the optimal distribution of photosynthesis according to the
   fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the
   photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with
   field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted
   a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf
   Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal
   light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the
   photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief
   periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base),
   the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make
   acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal
   acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity
   unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy
   level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is
   argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic
   potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to
   carbon gain or grain protein content.

AB Intrinsic growth rates often vary greatly among populations within a
   single species, implying that trade-offs with fast growth are present.
   It has been hypothesized that such a trade-off exists between growth
   rate and development rate. Growth-development trade-offs have been
   considered from observations of a negative correlation between growth
   and development rates among populations. In this study, we examined not
   only interpopulation but also intrapopulation correlations in a fish
   Oryzias latipes. Rearing experiments revealed that larvae from a
   high-latitude population grew faster but metamorphosed at larger sizes
   than larvae from a low-latitude population. Moreover, within each
   population, individuals that grew faster tended to delay metamorphosis.
   The parallelism of the negative interpopulation and intrapopulation
   correlations between growth and development rates strongly support a
   growth-development trade-off. Observations of swimming behaviors
   revealed that high-latitude, fast-growing juveniles showed lower
   steady-swimming and burst-swimming speeds, probably reflecting that
   their underdeveloped skeletal and muscular structures translated into
   the poorer swimming performances. These results suggest that the higher
   growth capacity of high-latitude O. latipes has evolved at the expense
   of fast development.

AB The circadian clock serves to coordinate physiology and behavior with
   the diurnal cycles derived from the daily rotation of the earth. In
   plants, circadian rhythms contribute to growth and yield and, hence, to
   both agricultural productivity and evolutionary fitness. Arabidopsis
   thaliana has served as a tractable model species in which to dissect
   clock mechanism and function, but it now becomes important to define the
   extent to which the Arabidopsis model can be extrapolated to other
   species, including crops. Accordingly, we have extended our studies to
   the close Arabidopsis relative and crop species, Brassica rapa. We have
   investigated natural variation in circadian function and flowering time
   among multiple B. rapa collections. There is wide variation in clock
   function, based on a robust rhythm in cotyledon movement, within a
   collection of B. rapa accessions, wild populations and recombinant
   inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between parents from two
   distinct subspecies, a rapid cycling Chinese cabbage (ssp. pekinensis)
   and a Yellow Sarson oilseed (ssp. trilocularis). We further analyzed the
   RILs to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for this
   natural variation in clock period and temperature compensation, as well
   as for flowering time under different temperature and day length
   settings. Most clock and flowering-time QTL mapped to overlapping
   chromosomal loci. We have exploited micro-synteny between the
   Arabidopsis and B. rapa genomes to identify candidate genes for these
   QTL.

AB This study investigated the physiological function of suppressed
   melatonin through thermoregulation in a cold environment. Interactions
   between thermoregulation directly affected by exposure to a cold
   environment and indirectly affected by endogenous melatonin suppression
   by bright-light exposure were examined. Ten male subjects were exposed
   to two different illumination intensities (30 and 5000 lux) for 4.5 h,
   and two different ambient temperatures (15 and 27 degrees C) for 2 h
   before sleep under dark and thermoneutral conditions. Salivary melatonin
   level was suppressed by bright light (p < 0.001), although the ambient
   temperature condition had no significant effect on melatonin. During
   sleep, significant effects of pre-sleep exposure to a cold ambient
   temperature (p < 0.001) and bright light (p < 0.01) on rectal
   temperature (T-re) were observed. Pre-sleep, bright-light exposure led
   to an attenuated fall in T-re during sleep. Moreover, T-re dropped more
   precipitously after cold exposure than thermoneutral conditions (cold:
   -0.54 +/- 0.07 degrees C/ h; thermoneutral: -0.16 +/- 0.03 degrees C/h;
   p < 0.001). Pre-sleep, bright-light exposure delayed the nadir time of
   T-re under thermoneutral conditions (p < 0.05), while cold exposure
   masked the circadian rhythm with a precipitous decrease in T-re. A
   significant correlation between the T-re nadir and melatonin level (r =
   -0.774, p < 0.05) indicated that inter-individual differences with
   higher melatonin levels lead to a reduction in T-re after cold exposure.
   These results suggest that suppressed endogenous melatonin inhibits the
   downregulation of the body temperature set-point during sleep. (Author

AB A full-factorial study of the effects of rates of temperature change and
   start temperatures was undertaken for both upper and lower critical
   thermal limits (CTLs) using the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes. Results
   show that rates of temperature change and start temperatures have highly
   significant effects on CTLs, although the duration of the experiment
   also has a major effect. Contrary to a widely held expectation, slower
   rates of temperature change (i.e. longer experimental duration) resulted
   in poorer thermal tolerance at both high and low temperatures. Thus,
   across treatments, a negative relationship existed between duration and
   upper CTL while a positive relationship existed between duration and
   lower CTL. Most importantly, for predicting tsetse distribution, G.
   pallidipes suffer loss of function at less severe temperatures under the
   most ecologically relevant experimental conditions for upper (0.06
   degrees C min(-1); 35 degrees C start temperature) and lower CTL (0.06
   degrees C min(-1); 24 degrees C start temperature). This suggests that
   the functional thermal range of G. pallidipes in the wild may be much
   narrower than previously suspected, approximately 20-40 degrees C, and
   highlights their sensitivity to even moderate temperature variation.
   These effects are explained by limited plasticity of CTLs in this
   species over short time scales. The results of the present study have
   broad implications for understanding temperature tolerance in these and
   other terrestrial arthropods.

AB There is considerable evidence for an adaptive role of inversions, but
   how their genetic content evolves and affects the subsequent evolution
   of chromosomal polymorphism remains controversial. Here, we track how
   life-history traits, chromosomal arrangements and 22 microsatellites,
   within and outside inversions, change in three replicated populations of
   Drosophila sub-obscura for 30 generations of laboratory evolution since
   founding from the wild. The dynamics of fitness-related traits indicated
   adaptation to the new environment concomitant with directional evolution
   of chromosomal polymorphism. Evidence of selective changes in frequency
   of inversions was obtained for seven of 23 chromosomal arrangements,
   corroborating a role for inversions in adaptation. The evolution of
   linkage disequilibrium between some microsatellites and chromosomes
   suggested that adaptive changes in arrangements involved changes in
   their genetic content. Several microsatellite alleles increased in
   frequency more than expected by drift in targeted inversions in all
   replicate populations. In particular, there were signs of selection in
   the O3+4 arrangement favouring a combination of alleles in two loci
   linked to the inversion and changing along with it, although the lack of
   linkage disequilibrium between these loci precludes epistatic selection.
   Seven other alleles increased in frequency within inversions more than
   expected by drift, but were not in linkage disequilibrium with them.
   Possibly these alleles were hitchhiking along with alleles under
   selection that were not specific to those inversions. Overall, the
   selection detected on the genetic content of inversions, despite limited
   coverage of the genome, suggests that genetic changes within inversions
   play an important role in adaptation.

AB The sex-determining mechanism has important demographic and genetic
   consequences by virtue of its effect on the population sex ratio. Here
   we investigate the effect of temperature dependent sex determination
   (TSD) on the primary sex ratio of the harpacticoid copepod, Tigriopus
   californicus. At the two experimental temperatures (15degrees and
   22degreesC) used in this study, the primary sex ratio is almost always
   biased in favour of males. Higher temperatures induce masculinization
   and the change in sex ratio is not caused by differential mortality of
   the sexes. The mean level of TSD in the population is small (proportion
   of males increases by similar to5% between 15degrees and 22degreesC)
   because only one-third of the families actually exhibit a significant
   sex-ratio response while the rest of the population is insensitive to
   temperature. A comparison of the primary sex ratio and the level of TSD
   between two locations reveals few differences among populations.
   Finally, individuals still exhibited TSD after having been maintained
   under constant temperature conditions in the lab for several
   generations. In addition the proportion of temperature-sensitive
   individuals remained unchanged. This suggests that the observed level of
   TSD is not an artefact of testing field-captured individuals in a novel
   laboratory environment. At this point the adaptive significance of
   temperature-dependent sex determination in T californicus remains
   unknown. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of

AB There is growing evidence that biotic factors such as predator-prey
   interactions play significant roles in driving species distribution
   across large spatial scales. The relative influence of abiotic and
   biotic factors on species distribution, however, may change under
   climate change. We investigated the relative influence of abiotic and
   biotic variables on the potential current and future distributions of
   three fruit bat species, Epomophorus angolensis (Gray, 1870), E.
   wahlbergi (Sundevall, 1846) and Rousettus aegyptiacus (E. Geoffroy
   St.-Hilaire, 1810), in southern Africa. We tested three hypotheses,
   namely that bat species' distribution is primarily driven by (1)
   productivity; (2) physiological tolerance to climate; and (3) biotic
   interactions, specifically fig distribution. We adopted an ensemble
   niche modelling approach to project the suitable habitat of fruit bat
   species for current and future climate scenarios, and assessed variable
   importance in the models using a randomised variable shuffle procedure.
   We predicted that both biotic and abiotic factors influence suitable
   habitat of fruit bats, the relative influence of factors on habitat
   suitability of bat species are taxon specific, and the relative
   influence of abiotic and biotic factors will change from current to
   future climate scenarios. Abiotic variables associated with productivity
   were the primary determinants of habitat suitability for E. wahlbergi
   and E. angolensis under both current and future conditions. By contrast,
   suitable habitat of R. aegyptiacus was primarily mediated by temperature
   under current climatic conditions yet by freestanding fig distribution
   under both moderate and extreme future climate change scenarios.
   Freestanding fig distribution was also the most significant factor of
   habitat suitability for E. angolensis under the extreme future climate
   change scenario. Our results were congruent with our predictions and
   suggest that biotic variables play important roles in determining
   habitat suitability of species at relatively large spatial scales,
   contrary to the conventional assumptions of the Grinnellian niche. (C)

AB We used experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster, which had
   either been subdivided (metapopulations) or kept undivided for 40
   generations, to study the consequences of population subdivision for the
   tolerance and adaptive response after six generations of exposure to
   novel environmental factors (high temperature, medium with ethanol or
   salt added) for traits with different genetic architectures. In this
   setup, we attempted to separate the effects of the loss of fitness due
   to inbreeding (i.e., the survival upon first exposure to stress) from
   the loss of adaptive potential due to the lack of genetic variation. To
   place our experimental results in a more general perspective, we used
   individual-based simulations combining different options of levels of
   gene flow, intensity of selection and genetic architecture to derive
   quantitative hypotheses of the effects of these factors on the adaptive
   response to stress. We observed that population subdivision resulted in
   substantial inter-deme variation in tolerance due to redistribution of
   genetic variation from within demes to among demes. In line with the
   simulation results, the adaptive response was generally lower in the
   subdivided than in the undivided populations, particularly so for high
   temperature. We observed pronounced differences between stress factors
   that are likely related to the different genetic architectures involved
   in resistance to these factors. From a conservation genetics viewpoint,
   our results have two important implications: (i) Long-term fragmentation
   in combination with restricted gene flow will limit the adaptive
   potential of individual subpopulations because adaptive variation will
   become distributed among populations rather than within populations.
   (ii) The genetic architecture of the trait(s) under selection is of
   great significance to understand the possible responses to novel
   stresses that may be expected.

AB Background: Populations of a species often differ in key traits.
   However, it is rarely known whether these differences are associated
   with genetic variation and evolved differences between populations, or
   are instead simply a plastic response to environmental differences
   experienced by the populations. Here we examine the interplay of
   plasticity and direct genetic control by investigating temperature-size
   relationships in populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura from North
   America. We used 27 isolines from three populations and exposed them to
   four temperature regimes (16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 26
   degrees C) to examine environmental, genetic and genotype-by-environment
   sources of variance in wing size.
   Results: By far the largest contribution to variation in wing size came
   from rearing temperature, with the largest flies emerging from the
   coolest temperatures. However, we also found a genetic signature that
   was counter to this pattern as flies originating from the northern,
   cooler population were consistently smaller than conspecifics from more
   southern, warmer populations when reared under the same laboratory
   conditions.
   Conclusions: We conclude that local selection on body size appears to be
   acting counter to the environmental effect of temperature. We find no
   evidence that local adaptation in phenotypic plasticity can explain this
   result, and suggest indirect selection on traits closely linked with
   body size, or patterns of chromosome inversion may instead be driving
   this relationship.

AB Many temperate ectotherms undergo thermal acclimation to remain
   functional over a wide range of body temperatures, but few studies have
   investigated whether populations of a single species have evolved
   differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance.
   Therefore, we asked whether the thermal plasticity of locomotor
   performance has diverged between northern and southern populations of
   eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens). We acclimated eastern newts
   from Florida and Maine to cold (6 A degrees C) or warm (28 A degrees C)
   conditions for 12 weeks. Following acclimation, we measured the burst
   speed of newts at 6, 11.5, 17, 22.5, 28, and 33.5 A degrees C. We also
   measured the activities of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH) in skeletal muscle of newts. The newts from Maine
   were better able to acclimate to low temperature compared to newts from
   Florida. Regardless of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity of burst
   speed was higher in the Florida compared to the Maine population. In
   general, newts from Maine performed better at low temperatures, whereas
   newts from Florida performed better at high temperatures. The activities
   of CK and LDH were lower in cold compared to warm-acclimated newts in
   the Florida population, but acclimation did not affect the activities of
   these enzymes in the Maine population. The activities of CK and LDH do
   not explain differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor
   performance between populations. Our results demonstrate that the
   thermal sensitivity and plasticity of locomotor performance differ
   between northern and southern populations of eastern newts, suggesting
   that these traits readily adapt to the thermal environment.

AB Thermoregulation in ectotherms may be modulated by climatic variability
   across geographic gradients. Environmental temperature varies along
   latitudinal dines resulting in heterogeneous thermal resource
   availability, which generally induces ectotherms to use compensatory
   mechanisms to thermoregulate. Lizards can accommodate to ambient
   temperature changes through a combination of adaptive evolution and
   behavioral and physiological plasticity. We studied the thermal ecology
   of the endangered endemic lizard Liolaemus multi-maculatus at six
   different sites distributed from the northern to southern areas of the
   distribution (700 km) in the Atlantic dune barriers of Argentina, and
   even including the borders areas of the distribution range.
   Environmental temperatures and relative humidity showed a strong
   contrast between northern and southern limits of the distribution range.
   The northern localities had operative temperatures (Te) above the range
   of preferred temperatures (Tset), instead, the southern localities had
   large proportion of Tes within the Tset. Although these different
   climatic conditions may constrain the thermal biology of L.
   multimaculatus, individuals from all localities maintained relatively
   similar field body temperatures (XTb = 34.07 +/- 3.02 degrees C),
   suggesting that this parameter is conservative. Thermal preference
   partially reflected latitudinal temperature gradient, since lizards from
   the two southernmost localities showed the lowest Tsel and Tset.
   Thermoregulatory efficiency differed among localities, since E values in
   the northern localities (E = 0.53-0.69) showed less variability than
   those of southern localities (E = 0.14-0.67). Although L. multimaculatus
   employed a strategy of having a conservative Tb and being able to
   acclimatize the thermal preference to copes with latitudinal changes in
   the thermal environment, other local factors, such as ecological
   interactions, may also impose limitations to thermoregulation and this
   may interfered in the interpretation of results at wider spatial scale.

AB Two morphologically and genetically distinct populations were recently
   recognized in the Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica), but little
   information is available on between-population variation in life-history
   traits. We collected eggs from Zhejiang (northern) and Hainan (southern)
   populations, and incubated them at constant temperatures of 26 degrees C
   and 30 degrees C. Hatchling body mass and early growth were determined
   in a common garden experiment to identify the intrinsic
   between-population difference in these life-history traits. Relative to
   egg size, hatchling body mass was larger in the Zhejiang population than
   in the Hainan population. Hatchlings from the Hainan population grew
   faster than their counterparts from the Zhejiang population. Growth
   rates differed between the sexes in the Hainan population (females >
   males), but not in the Zhejiang population. These results suggest that
   I) eggs from the Zhejiang population might contain more energy and thus
   produce larger hatchings than eggs of the same size from the Hainan
   population, and 2) the intrinsic fast growth rate of hatchlings could be
   the reason for the larger adult size observed in the Hainan population.

AB The population structure of the California market squid Loligo
   opalescens was studied for the Channel Islands region off Southern
   California between June 1998 and March 2000. During this time
   Californian waters were exposed to an extraordinary El Nino event that
   was possibly the most dramatic change in oceanographic conditions that
   occurred last century. There was then a rapid transition to record cool
   La Nina conditions. Statolith increments were used to determine age
   parameters and increment periodicity was validated for the first 54 days
   of life. Based on statolith increment counts, the oldest males and
   females were 257 and 225 days respectively and individuals matured as
   young as 129 and 137 days respectively. No distinct hatching period was
   detected. There was a general trend of increasing body size throughout
   the study period. Squid that hatched and,grew through the El Nino were
   strikingly smaller and had slower growth rates compared to squid that
   grew through the La Nina. This was related to oceanography and
   associated productivity. There was a positive correlation between squid
   mantle length and upwelling index and a negative correlation between
   mantle length and sea temperature. The 'live-fast die-young' life
   history strategy of squid makes them ideal candidates for following the
   effects of the dramatic changes in oceanographic conditions off
   California. We productivity integrators over time and space and are
   useful organisms to tie oceanography to biology.

AB Latitudinal clines in the frequency of various chromosomal inversions
   are well documented in Drosophila subobscura. Because these clines are
   roughly parallel on three continents, they have undoubtedly evolved by
   natural selection. Here, we address whether individuals carrying
   different chromosomal arrangements also vary in their thermal
   preferences (T-p) and heat stress tolerance (T-ko). Our results show
   that although T-p and T-ko were uncorrelated, flies carrying
   "cold-adapted" gene arrangements tended to choose lower temperatures in
   the laboratory or had a lower heat stress tolerance, in line with what
   could be expected from the natural patterns. Different chromosomes were
   mainly responsible for the underlying genetic variation in both traits,
   which explains why they are linearly independent. Assuming T-p
   corresponds closely with temperatures that maximize fitness our results
   are consistent with previous laboratory natural selection experiments
   showing that thermal optimum diverged among thermal lines, and that
   chromosomes correlated with T-p differences responded to selection as
   predicted here. Also consistent with data from the regular tracking of
   the inversion polymorphism since the colonization of the Americas by D.
   subobscura, we tentatively conclude that selection on tolerance to
   thermal extremes is more important in the evolution and dynamics of
   clinal patterns than the relatively "minor" adjustments from behavioral
   thermoregulation.

AB The increase in the abundance of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) in
   Texas bays and estuaries over the past 30 years is correlated to
   increased wintertime surface water temperatures. Trends in the relative
   abundance of gray snapper are evaluated by using monthly
   fishery-independent monitoring data from each of the seven major
   estuaries along the Texas coast from 1978 through 2006. Environmental
   conditions during this period demonstrated increasing annual sea surface
   temperatures, although this increase was not seasonally uniform. The
   largest proportion of temperature increases was attributed to higher
   winter temperature minimums since 1993. Positive phases of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation, resulting in wetter, warmer winters in the eastern
   United States have occurred nearly uninterrupted since the late 1970s,
   and unprecedented positive index values occurred between 1989 and 1995.
   Increases in water temperature in Texas estuaries, beginning in the
   early 1990s, are postulated to provide both favorable over-wintering
   conditions for the newly settled juveniles and increased recruitment
   success. In the absence of cold winters, this species has established
   semipermanent estuarine populations across the entire Texas coast. A
   shift to negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation will likely
   result in returns to colder winter temperature minimums that could
   reverse any recent population gains.

   and climate. With bluetongue virus (BTV) moving north from the
   Mediterranean, an entomological survey was conducted in Switzerland in
   2003 to assess the potential of the BTV vectors present. A total of 39
   cattle farms located in three geographical regions, the Ticino region,
   the Western region and the region of the Grisons, were monitored during
   the vector season. Farms were located in areas at high risk of vector
   introduction and establishment based on the following characteristics:
   annual average temperature > 12.5 degrees C, average annual humidity >
   60%, cattle farm. Onderstepoort black light traps were operated at the
   cattle farms generally for one night in July and one night in September.
   A total of 56 collections of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were
   identified morphologically. Only one single individual of Culicoides
   (Avaritia) imicola, the major Old World vector of BTV, was found in July
   2003 in the Ticino region, one of the southernmost regions of
   Switzerland. In the absence of further specimens of C. imicola from
   Switzerland it is suggested that this individual may be a vagrant
   transported by wind from regions to the south of the country where
   populations of this species are known to occur. Alternative potential
   BTV vectors of the Culicoides (Culicoides) pulicaris and Culicoides
   (Avaritia) obsoletus complexes were abundant in all sampled regions with
   individual catches exceeding 70 000 midges per trap night.

AB Elevational gradients provide natural experiments for examining how
   variation in abiotic forces such as nutrient mineralization rates, risk
   of photodamge, temperature, and precipitation influence plant-insect
   interactions. At the Coweeta LTER site in the Southern Appalachian
   Mountains, we examined spatial and temporal variation in striped maple,
   Acer pensylvanicum, foliar quality and associated patterns in the
   arthropod community. Variation in herbivore densities was associated
   more strongly with seasonal variation in plant quality than with spatial
   variation in quality among three sampling sites. Leaf chewer, but not
   phloem feeder or arthropod predator, densities increased with elevation.
   Foliar quality, by our measures, decreased throughout the growing
   season, with decreases in nitrogen concentrations and increases in
   lignin concentrations. Foliar quality varied among the three sites but
   not systematically along the elevational gradient, We conclude that, in
   this system, temporal heterogeneity in plant quality is likely to be
   more important to insect herbivores than is spatial heterogeneity and
   that other factors, such as the abiotic environment and natural enemies,
   likely have substantial effects on herbivore density.

   G-actin diffusion for >30 filaments. There is an optimal number of

   microns. The model explains characteristic interfilopodial distance of a
   few microns as a balance of initiation, lateral drift, and merging of

   focused and protected from capping ( the capping rate has to decrease
   one order of magnitude) once every hundred seconds per micron of the
   leading edge to initiate the observed number of filopodia. The model
   generates testable predictions about how filopodial length, rate of

AB Although increases in mean temperature (MT) and extreme high temperature
   (EHT) can greatly affect population dynamics of insects under global
   warming, how concurrent changes in both MT and EHT affect invasive
   species is largely unknown. We used four thermal regimes to simulate the
   increases in summer temperature and compared their effects on the
   life-history traits of three geographical populations (Chongqing, Wuhan
   and Shanghai) of an invasive insect, Corythucha ciliata, in China. The
   four thermal regimes were control (i.e., natural or ambient), an
   increase in MT (IMT), an increase in EHT, and a combination of IMT +
   EHT. We found that the three warming regimes significantly increased the
   developmental rate but did not affect the survival, sex ratio,
   longevity, or fecundity of C. ciliata. Consequently, the intrinsic rate
   of natural increase (r(m)) was enhanced and the number of days required
   for population doubling (t) was reduced by the warming regimes. The
   demographic parameters did not significantly differ among the three
   populations. These results indicate that population size of C. ciliata
   may be enhanced by increases in both temperature means and extremes. The
   increases in summer temperature associated with climate change,
   therefore, would likely facilitate population outbreaks of some
   thermophilic invasive insects.

AB Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is thought to be a major hub in the network
   of physiological mechanisms connecting life history traits. Evaporative
   water loss (EWL) is a physiological indicator that is widely used to
   measure water relations in inter- or intraspecific studies of birds in
   different environments. In this study, we examined the physiological
   responses of summer-acclimatized Hwamei Garrulax canorus to temperature
   by measuring their body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (MR) and EWL
   at ambient temperatures (T-a) between 5 and 40 degrees C. Overall, we
   found that mean body temperature was 42.4 degrees C and average minimum
   thermal conductance (C) was 0.15 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1) degrees C-1 measured
   between 5 and 20 degrees C. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) was 31.8-35.3
   degrees C and BMR was 181.83 ml O-2 h(-1). Below the lower critical
   temperature, MR increased linearly with decreasing Ta according to the
   relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1)) = 266.59-2.66 T-a. At T(a)s above the
   upper critical temperature, MR increased with Ta according to the
   relationship: MR (ml O-2 h(-1))= 271.26+12.85 T-a. EWL increased with
   T-a according to the relationship: EWL (mg H2O h(-1))= 19.16+12.64 T-a
   and exceeded metabolic water production at T-a > 14.0 degrees C. The
   high T-b and thermal conductance, low BMR, narrow TNZ, and high
   evaporative water production/metabolic water production (EWP/MWP) ratio
   in the Hwamei are consistent with the idea that this species is adapted
   to warm, mesic climates, where metabolic thermogenesis and water
   conservation are not strong selective pressures. (C) 2013 Published by

AB This paper presents an investigation on the buckling and postbuckling of
   microtubules (MTs) subjected to a uniform external radial pressure in
   thermal environments. The microtubule is modeled as a nonlocal shear
   deformable cylindrical shell which contains small scale effects. The
   governing equations are based on higher order shear deformation shell
   theory with a von Karman-Donnell-type of kinematic nonlinearity and
   include the extension-twist and flexural-twist couplings. The thermal
   effects are also included and the material properties are assumed to be
   temperature-dependent. A singular perturbation technique is employed to
   determine the buckling pressure and postbuckling equilibrium paths. The
   small scale parameter e(o)a is estimated by matching the buckling
   pressure of MTs measured from the experiments with the numerical results
   obtained from the nonlocal shear deformable shell model. The numerical
   results show that buckling pressure and postbuckling behavior of MTs are

AB Cold acclimation is a process used by most temperate plants to cope with
   freezing stress. In this process, the expression of cold-responsive
   (COR) genes is activated and the genes undergo physiological changes in
   response to theexposure to low, non-freezing temperatures and other
   environmental signals. The C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs) have been
   demonstrated to regulate the expression of many COR genes. Recent
   studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of how plants transmit
   cold signals from the plasma membrane to the CBFs and the results have
   indicated that COR genes are also regulated through CBF-independent
   pathways. Climate change is expected to have a major impact on cold
   acclimation and freezing tolerance of plants. However, howclimate change
   affects plant cold acclimation at the molecular level remains unclear.
   This mini-review focuses on recent advances in cold acclimation in
   Arabidopsis thaliana and discusses how signaling can be potentially
   impacted by climate change. Understanding how plants acquire cold
   acclimationis valuable forthe improvement of the freezing tolerance in
   plants and for predicting the effects of climate change on plant
   distribution and agricultural yield.

AB Black leaf streak disease (BLSD), caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella
   fijiensis, is an important threat to banana production. Although its
   control relies on costly and unsustainable use of fungicides, ecological
   regulation of BLSD linked to field-scale plant diversity has received
   little attention. We monitored banana phytometers in plots in
   banana-based fields where no fungicides were applied. Within each plot,
   we measured plant richness in three strata, canopy openness, necrotic
   leaf removal, Musa abundance and richness. We quantified ecological
   regulation of five BLSD parameters (inoculum sources, spore abundance,
   lesion density, incubation time, and the area under the disease
   progression curve) and identified, using structural equation modeling,
   the characteristics of the plant community and the mechanisms likely
   responsible for the regulation. Regulation occurred, but most
   effectively before lesion formation, and was mainly related to plant
   richness between 1.5 and 5m high. A barrier effect, rather than a
   dilution effect, more likely limited spore abundance. Our results
   support the hypothesis that the potential effects of plant richness on
   leaf-scale microclimate variability and on the diversity of epiphyllic
   microorganisms are involved in the regulation of incubation time and
   lesion density. Field-scale management of plant diversity may be a
   promising lever to foster ecological regulation of BLSD.

AB To better understand recruitment variability in small pelagic fish like
   sprat, it is important to know when during the extended spawning season
   the successful recruits are predominantly produced and which
   environmental factors determine potential survival windows. Here, we
   inferred the temporal origin of 2-year classes (2002-2003) of western
   and central Baltic sprat by means of otolith microstructure analysis,
   and found that in both years recruits mainly originated from the summer
   months June and July. In both years, this period coincided with
   temperature conditions in the surface layer of >12 degrees C and peak
   seasonal abundance of the largest copepod stages of Acartia spp., the
   major prey item of sprat larvae. The peaks in seasonal sprat egg
   abundance, however, occurred in April 2002 and March 2003 and therefore
   about 1-2 months earlier than the long-term mean spawning peak of sprat
   in this area (end of May/beginning of June). We hypothesize that
   increased temperatures in the bottom layer of the Baltic, where the
   pre-spawning sprat stock concentrates during winter months, potentially
   caused this shift in sprat spawning patterns, although early spring
   temperatures and feeding conditions in upper water layers were still
   unfavourable for larval survival. Sprat recruitment, however, was
   comparatively strong in both 2002 and 2003, suggesting that summer born
   individuals had high enough survival rates to compensate for the
   spawning shift, possibly due to high summer temperatures, limited
   dispersion, and low predation mortalities by Baltic cod as the major
   predator of sprat. Recruits were on average younger in 2003 than 2002,
   yet length distributions in October were almost identical, likely
   because a period of substantially higher temperatures in July/August
   2003 promoted faster initial (larval) growth of survivors. Given the
   strength of the 2003 year class, in spite of lower overall prey
   concentrations in 2003 than 2002 in the study area, our findings appear
   to emphasise the paramount importance of summer temperatures as the
   recruitment determinant in Baltic sprat. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

   studies of climate change. They contain information on past climate, on
   forcing factors such as greenhouse gas concentrations, and on numerous
   other environmental parameters. For recent centuries, sites with high
   snow accumulation are chosen. They have, for example, provided the only
   direct evidence that carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by
   over 30% over the last two centuries. They have provided key datasets
   for other greenhouse gases, and for other forcings such as solar and
   volcanic. Over longer timescales, the Vostok ice core has shown how
   greenhouse gas concentrations and climate have closely tracked one
   another over the last 400000 years. Other cores have shown detailed
   spatial and temporal detail of climate transitions, including the
   Antarctic response during rapid climate events such as
   Dansgaard-Oeschger events. The new core from Dome C has extended the

AB Latitudinal variation in thorax and wing size traits was studied in
   wild-caught flies of the cactophilic Drosophila species, D. aldrichi and
   D. buzzatii, and their laboratory-reared progeny. The flies originated
   from five populations in Queensland, Australia, spanning an 800-km
   transect. The laboratory flies were reared at controlled densities and
   three temperatures, 20, 25, and 30 degreesC. We measured the same traits
   for the laboratory-reared flies as for the wild-caught flies, plus
   developmental time and viability. Latitudinal variation in wild-caught
   flies of both species followed a similar pattern for all linear size
   traits, with size generally increasing from north to south, but with
   flies from one intermediate locality markedly smaller. A drier
   environment at this locality and weather conditions immediately prior to
   collection, most likely explain the reduced size. Laboratory-reared D.
   aldrichi from this locality also were smaller than those from other
   localities, and had the fastest developmental time and highest
   viability. In laboratory-reared flies, body size traits did not show any
   clear trend to increase with latitude. The patterns of change with
   latitude were different between species, with D. aldrichi more similar
   in pattern to that of the natural populations. D, aldrichi had
   comparatively higher coefficients of variation in the laboratory-reared
   flies and lower viability at all temperatures. However, fluctuating
   asymmetry was lower in D. aldrichi in both wild-caught and
   laboratory-reared flies. The differences among populations of D.
   aldrichi for all traits were much larger than for D. buzzatii. As these
   differences in the laboratory-reared flies are expected to be largely
   genetic, they most likely reflect adaptation to specific (unknown)
   environmental factors that do not show linear latitudinal variation on
   the geographical scale studied.

AB Species' responses to climate change are variable and diverse, yet our
   understanding of how different responses (e.g. physiological,
   behavioural, demographic) relate and how they affect the parameters most
   relevant for conservation (e.g. population persistence) is lacking.
   Despite this, studies that observe changes in one type of response
   typically assume that effects on population dynamics will occur, perhaps
   fallaciously. We use a hierarchical framework to explain and test when
   impacts of climate on traits (e.g. phenology) affect demographic rates
   (e.g. reproduction) and in turn population dynamics. Using this
   conceptual framework, we distinguish four mechanisms that can prevent
   lower-level responses from impacting population dynamics. Testable
   hypotheses were identified from the literature that suggest life-history
   and ecological characteristics which could predict when these mechanisms
   are likely to be important. A quantitative example on birds illustrates
   how, even with limited data and without fully-parameterized population
   models, new insights can be gained; differences among species in the
   impacts of climate-driven phenological changes on population growth were
   not explained by the number of broods or density dependence. Our
   approach helps to predict the types of species in which climate
   sensitivities of phenotypic traits have strong demographic and
   population consequences, which is crucial for conservation
   prioritization of data-deficient species.

AB Background: Seabirds are important components of marine ecosystems, both
   as predators and as indicators of ecological change, being conspicuous
   and sensitive to changes in prey abundance. To determine whether
   fluctuations in population sizes are localised or indicative of
   large-scale ecosystem change, we must first understand population
   structure and dispersal. King penguins are long-lived seabirds that
   occupy a niche across the sub-Antarctic zone close to the Polar Front.
   Colonies have very different histories of exploitation, population
   recovery, and expansion.
   Results: We investigated the genetic population structure and patterns
   of colonisation of king penguins across their current range using a
   dataset of 5154 unlinked, high-coverage single nucleotide polymorphisms
   generated via restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq).
   Despite breeding at a small number of discrete, geographically separate
   sites, we find only very slight genetic differentiation among colonies
   separated by thousands of kilometers of open-ocean, suggesting migration
   among islands and archipelagos may be common. Our results show that the
   South Georgia population is slightly differentiated from all other
   colonies and suggest that the recently founded Falkland Island colony is
   likely to have been established by migrants from the distant Crozet
   Islands rather than nearby colonies on South Georgia, possibly as a
   result of density-dependent processes.
   Conclusions: The observed subtle differentiation among king penguin
   colonies must be considered in future conservation planning and
   monitoring of the species, and demographic models that attempt to
   forecast extinction risk in response to large-scale climate change must
   take into account migration. It is possible that migration could buffer
   king penguins against some of the impacts of climate change where
   colonies appear panmictic, although it is unlikely to protect them
   completely given the widespread physical changes projected for their
   Southern Ocean foraging grounds. Overall, large-scale population genetic
   studies of marine predators across the Southern Ocean are revealing more
   interconnection and migration than previously supposed.

AB Tree mortality is an important process in forest ecosystems, frequently
   hypothesized to be highly climate sensitive. Yet, tree death remains one
   of the least understood processes of forest dynamics. Recently, changes
   in tree mortality have been observed in forests around the globe, which
   could profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services provisioning
   to society. We describe continental-scale patterns of recent tree
   mortality from the only consistent pan-European forest monitoring
   network, identifying recent mortality hotspots in southern and northern
   Europe. Analyzing 925,462 annual observations of 235,895 trees between
   2000 and 2012, we determine the influence of climate variability and
   tree age on interannual variation in tree mortality using Cox
   proportional hazard models. Warm summers as well as high seasonal
   variability in precipitation increased the likelihood of tree death.
   However, our data also suggest that reduced cold-induced mortality could
   compensate increased mortality related to peak temperatures in a warming
   climate. Besides climate variability, age was an important driver of
   tree mortality, with individual mortality probability decreasing with
   age over the first century of a trees life. A considerable portion of
   the observed variation in tree mortality could be explained by
   satellite-derived net primary productivity, suggesting that widely
   available remote sensing products can be used as an early warning
   indicator of widespread tree mortality. Our findings advance the
   understanding of patterns of large-scale tree mortality by demonstrating
   the influence of seasonal and diurnal climate variation, and highlight
   the potential of state-of-the-art remote sensing to anticipate an
   increased likelihood of tree mortality in space and time.

AB Biological membranes are composed of different components and there is
   no a priori reason to assume that all components are isotropic. It was
   previously shown that the anisotropic properties of membrane components
   may explain the stability of membrane tubular protrusions even without
   the application of external force. Our theoretical study focuses on the
   role of anisotropic membrane components in the stability of membrane
   tubular structures generated or stabilized by actin filaments. We show
   that the growth of the actin cytoskeleton inside the vesicle can induce
   the partial lateral segregation of different membrane components. The
   entropy of mixing of membrane components hinders the total lateral
   segregation of the anisotropic and isotropic membrane components.
   Self-assembled aggregates formed by anisotropic membrane components
   facilitate the growth of long membrane tubular protrusions. Protrusive
   force generated by actin filaments favors strong segregation of membrane
   components by diminishing the opposing effect of mixing entropy.

AB Benthic species from rocky intertidal systems are irregularly
   distributed along marine coastlines. Nearshore pelagic conditions often
   help to explain such variation, but most such studies have been done on
   eastern ocean boundary coasts. We investigated possible benthic-pelagic
   coupling along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, a western ocean
   boundary coast. In 2014, we surveyed high-intertidal habitats from nine
   wave-exposed bedrock locations spanning 415 km of coastline. At each
   location in the spring, we measured the recruitment of barnacles and
   mussels, the two main filter-feeders. Recruitment varied irregularly
   along the coast. Satellite data on coastal phytoplankton and particulate
   organic carbon (food for intertidal filter-feeders and their pelagic
   larvae) and in-situ data on sea surface temperature explained, to
   varying degrees, the geographic structure of recruitment. In turn, the
   summer abundance of barnacles and mussels was positively related to
   their spring recruitment. Ultimately, intertidal predator (dogwhelk)
   abundance was positively related to the recruitment and/or abundance of
   barnacles and mussels (the main prey of dogwhelks). Sea ice may also
   have influenced this predator-prey interaction. Drift ice leaving the
   Gulf of St. Lawrence in late winter strongly disturbed the northern
   surveyed locations, making barnacles (through high spring recruitment)
   the only food source for dogwhelks (which survived ice scour in
   crevices) in such places. Overall, this study supports the occurrence of
   benthic-pelagic coupling and bottom-up forcing on this coast.
   Investigating the oceanographic drivers of pelagic food supply and
   seawater temperature should help to further understand how this large
   metacommunity is organized.

AB The efficiency of cultivar trial networks is an important subject in
   official cultivar testing. We investigated this efficiency for malting
   barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in Uruguay, using data on 213 cultivars
   tested across an eight-year period at six locations. The
   variance-components approach was used to quantify the effects of years,
   locations, sowing dates and replicates on the precision of cultivar mean
   comparisons. The relationships among testing environments and genotypic
   adaptation patterns were explored via biplots. Factorial regression was
   used to model genotype x environment interaction (GEI) directly in
   relation to measured environmental variables. Variance components
   indicated that both the number of locations and sowing dates could be
   reduced. Biplot analysis identified some repeatable GEI patterns.
   Factorial regression showed that mean daily temperature during the

AB In annual plants with determinate growth, sugar accumulation signals
   high carbon availability once growth has ceased, resulting in
   senescence-dependent nutrient recycling to the seeds. However, this
   senescence-inducing effect of sugars is abolished at cold temperature,
   where sugar accumulation is important for protection. Here, natural
   variation was exploited to analyse the effect of chilling on
   interactions between leaf senescence, sugars, and phytohormones in
   Arabis alpina, a perennial plant with indeterminate growth. Eight
   accessions of A. alpina originating from between 2090 and 3090 m above
   sea level in the French Alps were used to identify heritable adaptations
   in senescence, stress response, sugars, and phytohormones to altitude.
   Accessions from high altitudes showed an enhanced capacity for sucrose
   accumulation and a diminished loss of chlorophyll in response to
   chilling. At warm temperature, sucrose content was negatively correlated
   with chlorophyll content, and sucrose treatment induced leaf senescence.
   Chilling resulted in lower indole-3-acetic acid, but higher zeatin and
   jasmonic acid contents. Interactions between sugar and phytohormones
   included a positive correlation between sucrose and jasmonic acid
   contents that may be involved in promoting the stress-dependent decline
   in chlorophyll. These findings reveal regulatory interactions that
   underlie adaptation in the senescence and stress response to chilling.

AB Emerging infectious diseases are contributing to global declines in
   coral reef ecosystems, highlighting a growing need for aetiological
   knowledge to develop effective management strategies. In this review, we
   focus on black band disease (BBD), one of the most virulent diseases and
   the only polymicrobial disease so far known to affect corals. A
   multipartite microbial consortium dominated by Cyanobacteria, but also
   including sulfur-cycling bacteria, other bacterial groups and members of
   the Archaea and Eukarya, forms a sulfide-rich anaerobic mat that
   migrates across the surface of coral colonies, killing the underlying
   tissues. The polymicrobial nature of the disease challenges classic
   aetiological approaches to unravelling disease causation. Here, we
   synthesize current knowledge on the range of pathogens forming the
   microbial consortium with recent studies on the transmission,
   biogeochemistry and environmental drivers of BBD to develop a conceptual
   model of BBD pathogenesis. The model illustrates how the development of
   BBD virulence factors is linked to a cascade of microbial community
   shifts and associated functional roles that progressively develop the
   microbial consortium from comparatively benign cyanobacterial patches to
   virulent BBD lesions. This review showcases how an approach that
   integrates multiple key aspects of the disease provides insights
   essential to elucidating the aetiology of BBD.

AB The 2-7-year periodicities recorded in fossil coral records have been
   widely used to identify paleo-El Nio events. However, the reliability of
   this approach in the South China Sea (SCS) has not been assessed in
   detail. Therefore, this paper presents monthly resolution geochemical
   records covering the period 1978-2015 obtained from a Porites coral
   recovered from the SCS to test the reliability of this method. The
   results suggest that the SCS coral reliably recorded local seawater
   conditions and the super El Nio events that occurred over the past 3
   decades, but does not appear to have been sensitive enough to record all
   the other El Nios. In detail, the Sr/Ca series distinctly documents only
   the two super El Nios of 1997-1998 and 2014-2016 as obvious low values,
   but does not match the Oceanic Nio Index well. The super El Nio of
   1982-1983 was identified by the growth hiatus caused by the coral
   bleaching and subsequent death of the coral. Three distinct stepwise
   variations occur in the delta C-13 series that are coincident with the
   three super El Nios, which may be related to a substantial decline in
   endosymbiotic zooxanthellae density caused by the increase in
   temperature during an El Nio or the selective utilization of different
   zooxanthellaes that was required to survive in the extreme environment.
   The increase in rainfall and temperatures over the SCS during El Nios
   counteracts the effects on seawater delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) and
   salinity; consequently, coral Delta delta O-18 series can be used as a
   proxy for delta O-18(sw) and salinity, but are not appropriate for
   identifying El Nio activity. The findings presented here suggest that
   the method to identify paleo-El Nio activity based on the 2-7-year
   periodicities preserved in the SCS coral records might not be reliable,
   because the SCS is on the edge of El Nio anomalies due to its great
   distance from the central equatorial Pacific and the imprints of weak
   and medium strength El Nio events may not be recorded by the corals
   there.

AB FtsZ is a bacterial protein that forms filaments that play an essential
   role in midcell constriction during the process of cell division. The
   shape of individual filaments of different lengths imaged with atomic
   force microscopy was modeled considering the protein monomers as beads
   in a chain and a few parameters to represent their effective
   interactions. The flexural rigidity and persistence length of the
   filaments were estimated. This latter value was comparable to the
   filament length, implying that these biological polymers are halfway
   between the perfectly stiff linear aggregate whose shapes are fully
   controlled by the angle between the monomers and highly flexible
   polymers whose shapes follow a random walk model. The lateral
   interactions between adjacent filaments, also estimated in the modeling,
   were found to play an essential role in determining the final shape and
   kinetics of the coiled structures found in longer polymers. The
   estimated parameters were used to model the behavior of the polymers
   also on a cylindrical surface. This analysis points to the formation of
   helical structures that suggest a mechanism for force generation and
   amplification through the development of FtsZ spirals at the midcell
   division point.

AB We have taken advantage of parallel instances of natural selection on
   body size in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate constraints and
   adaptation affecting wing shape. Using recently developed techniques for
   statistical shape analysis, we have examined variation in wing shape in
   similar body size clines on three continents. Gender-related shape
   differences were constant among all populations, suggesting that gender
   differences represent a developmental constraint on wing shape. In
   contrast, the underlying shape varied significantly between continents
   and shape change within each cline (i.e., between small and large body
   size populations) also varied between continents. Therefore, variation
   at these two levels presumably results from either drift or natural
   selection. Functional considerations suggest that shape variation
   between the continents is unlikely to be adaptive. However,
   cline-related shape change, which we show has a significant allometric
   component, may be adaptive. The overall range of wing shape variation,
   across a large range of wing size, is extremely small, and the
   possibility that wing shape is subject to stabilizing selection (or
   canalization) is discussed.

AB Elucidating new reproductive traits and evaluating how they vary within
   and among species in a geographic context, is relevant to understanding
   the evolutionary processes underlying diversity in life-history
   strategies. In this study we describe the breeding biology of Catharus
   dryas in a Peruvian population, and compare life history traits with a
   subtropical population and other temperate Catharus thrushes to better
   understand intra and interspecific variations in nesting traits. We
   monitored 35 nests of C. dryas between 2008 and 2013 in an Andean cloud
   forest of the Manu National Park in Peru and conducted a literature
   review of the nesting biology of Catharus species. We provide new
   information on nest architecture, nestling growth rate, incubation
   behaviour, reproductive phenology and egg temperature. The intraspecific
   comparison with an Argentinian population showed that despite the 13
   degrees latitudinal differences, nesting characters were highly
   conserved. These include a clutch size of two eggs, and an incubation
   and nestling period of 14 days. Nest attendance differed slightly (60
   and 67% in Peru and Argentina, respectively). The interspecific
   comparisons showed that tropical and temperate species followed
   respectively slow and fast reproductive strategies in most of the traits
   according to the life-history theory, but other such as average
   incubation time, nestling feeding rate, and some dimensions in the nest
   architecture were similar between C. dryas and the temperate species.
   Although detailed descriptions are needed for Catharus species,
   especially tropical species to conduct more robust comparisons, our
   results exemplify how intra and interspecific comparison based on
   natural history data can help to understand life-history evolution in a
   biogeographic context.

AB While the invasive zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha has rapidly spread
   throughout the Great Lakes and inland waterways, it is being displaced
   by the quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis in shallow water habitats.
   However, zebra mussels remain dominant in areas with higher water
   velocity. We hypothesized that the persistence of zebra over quagga
   mussels in habitats with higher water velocity might result from greater
   rate and strength of byssal thread attachment. We examined whether zebra
   mussels relative to quagga mussels have: (1) higher byssal thread
   synthesis rate, (2) lower dislodgment in flow and (3) greater mechanical
   force required for detachment from substrate. Specifically, we examined
   byssal thread synthesis rate and dislodgment of both species in response
   to water velocities of 0, 50, 100 and 180 cm s(-1). Byssal thread
   synthesis rate was significantly higher for zebra than for quagga
   mussels at all velocities. Dislodgment from the substrate increased for
   both species with increasing velocity but was significantly lower for
   zebra than for quagga mussels. We also tested the mechanical force to
   detach mussels after short (32h) and long (two and three months) periods
   of attachment on hard substrate. Detachment force was significantly
   higher for zebra than for quagga mussels only after short-term
   attachment. Higher byssal thread synthesis rate in zebra mussels was a
   likely factor that minimized their dislodgment in flow and increased
   short-term attachment strength. Differences in byssal thread synthesis
   rate between the two species might partly account for the ability of
   zebra mussels to maintain dominance over quagga mussels in habitats with
   high velocities.

AB It has long been known that there is an allometric relationship between
   metabolic rate (M) and body weight (W) of the form: M = M0Wb. However,
   the debate remains open regarding the value of b. Only recently research
   turned to the ecological implications of existing differences in
   metabolic scaling among taxa. Using a data set on forest soil
   invertebrates, we evaluated the influence of differences in
   intraspecific metabolic rate scaling on observed species biomass and
   abundance distributions. We found that absolute densities and biomass
   were correlated with the exponents of the intraspecific metabolic
   scaling. Evenness of the abundance distributions and species diversity
   were also moderately linked to b. These results suggest that the shape
   of the intraspecific metabolic-rate body-size relationship affects
   interspecific biomass and abundance distributions. This emphasizes the
   importance of intraspecific variations in allometric scaling and
   indicates the need to take these variations into account when proposing
   models to explain these relationships.

   in the wider barley germplasm. The Thr/Ala-233 and Ala/Ser-885

   was confirmed from further sequence analysis. The results will provide a

   forests on three wetland perimeters established since the Little Ice Age
   concluded in the 1850s. Dwarf birch shrubs at three wetland sites showed
   median apparent tree-ring age of 13 years, indicating recent shrub
   colonization at these sites. Peat cores at 24 wetland sites (basal peat
   ages 1840-18 740 calibrated years before present) indicated that these
   peatlands originated as wet Sphagnum-sedge fens with very little woody
   vegetation. Local meteorological records show a 55% decline in available
   water since 1968, of which one-third is due to higher summer
   temperatures and increased evapotranspiration and two-thirds is due to

AB Introduction: The present study aimed to determine the variables that
   are associated with a longer dialysis recovery time (DRT) and to define
   the relationship that exists between DRT and the ultrafiltration rate
   (UFR) in prevalent chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients. Methods: We
   studied 210 prevalent CHD of 5 hemodialysis units in Central Italy.
   Patients were invited to answer to the question: "How long does it take
   you to recover from a dialysis session?" Answers to this question were
   subsequently converted into minutes. Demographic, clinical and
   laboratory parameters were recorded for each patient as well as the UFR
   (mL/kg/h), the dialysate sodium concentration and temperature. Results:
   Median DRT was 180 min (60-420). Ninety five (45%) patients had a DRT >=
   the median value. Mean UFR was 9.2 +/- 3.0 mL/kg/h. Patients with a
   lower DRT had a less prevalent disability in the instrumental activities
   daily living, had a higher UFR, and a lower dialysate temperature, as
   compared with subjects with higher DRT. According to the logistic
   regression model, UFR was associated with a DRT below the median (i.e.,
   180) in the unadjusted model (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23; p = 0.019),
   after adjusting for age and sex (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01-1.22; p = 0.025),
   and in the fully adjusted model (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.04-1.22; p = 0.040).
   UFR increase was associated with increasing probability of DRT below the
   median (p for trend = 0.035). The highest tertile of DRT was associated
   with UFR below the mean value (i.e., 9.2 mL/kg/h) in multinomial
   logistic regression having the lowest DRT tertile as reference. DRT was
   significantly lower in patients with UFR > 13 mL/kg/h than in patients
   with UFR 10-13 or <10 mL/kg/h. Conclusion: DRT is inversely associated
   with UFR in CHD patients. Whether a high UFR should be recommended to
   reduce the DRT needs to be elucidated through an adequate prospective
   randomized study. (c) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB -A comparative analysis of the variability of morphobiological and
   genetic characteristics in samples from the largest stocks of Atlantic
   cod in waters of the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic was conducted.
   Using the results of pairwise assessment of genetic differentiation for
   the studied microsatellite loci, it was established that the dataset
   from waters of the New England shelf differed significantly from
   Iceland-Greenland and Lofoten-Barents Sea cod stocks. It was noted that
   samples of cod from the waters of East and West Greenland and cod from
   the waters of the Norwegian and Barents seas, despite significant
   geographical separation, showed a high level of identity. Special
   features of application of the model for isolation by distance to
   studying the formation mechanisms of the population structure were
   reviewed.

AB Striped marlin (Kajikia audax) is an epipelagic fish distributed in
   oceanic and coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. This species is usually
   found in warm and coastal waters with high primary productivity. The
   main goal of this study was to describe the spatial segregation of
   striped marlin by average Eye-Fork length (EFL) in the eastern Pacific
   Ocean (EPO) and its relationship with environmental variables using EFL
   data obtained from tuna purse-seining and Generalized Additive Models
   (GAMs). The model suggested that larger individuals of striped marlin
   were more likely to be found in waters with high Chlorophyll-a
   concentration (>2 mg/m(3)) and with temperatures lower than 25 degrees
   C, within a region known as the "cold tongue" and the Humboldt current
   system, while smaller individuals were more likely to be found in warmer
   and low productive areas within a region known as the "warm pool of the
   EPO." We observed that set type caused a large variation on average EFL
   of striped marlin; larger fish were captured in sets associated with
   floating objects (natural and manmade), while smaller fish were captured
   in sets associated with dolphins. Despite this, our findings suggest
   that striped marlin has a latitudinal gradient in average EFL; larger
   individuals occurred predominantly south of 10 degrees N, while smaller
   ones occurred predominantly in coastal waters between 10 degrees N and
   20 degrees N, thus demonstrating a spatial segregation of the species
   affected by its maturity stage.

AB Theory predicts the emergence of generalists in variable environments
   and antagonistic pleiotropy to favour specialists in constant
   environments, but empirical data seldom support such
   generalist-specialist trade-offs. We selected for generalists and
   specialists in the dung fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) under
   conditions that we predicted would reveal antagonistic pleiotropy and
   multivariate trade-offs underlying thermal reaction norms for juvenile
   development. We performed replicated laboratory evolution using four
   treatments: adaptation at a hot (31 degrees C) or a cold (15 degrees C)
   temperature, or under regimes fluctuating between these temperatures,
   either within or between generations. After 20 generations, we assessed
   parental effects and genetic responses of thermal reaction norms for
   three correlated life-history traits: size at maturity, juvenile growth
   rate and juvenile survival. We find evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy
   for performance at hot and cold temperatures, and a temperature-mediated
   trade-off between juvenile survival and size at maturity, suggesting
   that trade-offs associated with environmental tolerance can arise via
   intensified evolutionary compromises between genetically correlated
   traits. However, despite this antagonistic pleiotropy, we found no
   support for the evolution of increased thermal tolerance breadth at the
   expense of reduced maximal performance, suggesting low genetic variance
   in the generalist-specialist dimension.

AB Soil Freeze-Thaw Cycles (FTCs) can provide large amounts of labile C and
   N to microorganisms to stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) production and
   emission in the soil. To explore the effects of FTCs on N2O fluxes in
   the pristine riparian marsh, we used the static chamber-GC techniques to
   investigate N2O fluxes in the marsh meadow Calamagrostis angustifolia
   wetland (MMCW), Ecotone wetland (EW) and Carex Schmidtii Meinsh. marsh
   (CSMM) in Sanjiang Plain from March to April 2016. The results showed
   that the three marshes were potential sources of N2O during FTCS. The
   variations of N2O fluxes in the three marshes were significantly
   different (P < 0.001) during FTCS. Principal component analysis and
   regression analysis indicated that soil NH4+-N and NO3--N content were
   the main driving factors of N2O fluxes in MMCW. Though significant
   correlations were observed between N2O fluxes and soil NH4+-N content in
   0 to10 cm soil depth in EW (r=0.98, P < 0.01) and in CSMM (r= 0.93, P <
   0.05) respectively, the driving factors of N2O fluxes during FTCS in EW
   and CSMM were uncertain. In conclusion, soil FTCS might contribute to
   the emissions of N2O in the pristine riparian marshes.

AB Freeze tolerance in the frog Rana sylvatica is supported by
   nonanticipatory mobilization of cryoprotectant (glucose) and
   redistribution of organ water. Other freeze-tolerant frogs may manifest
   these responses but differences exist. For example, the gray treefrog
   (Hyla versicolor) accumulates mostly glycerol as opposed to glucose. The
   current study reports additional novel features about cryoprotection in
   H. versicolor. Frogs were acclimated to low temperature for 12 weeks and
   frozen for 3 days at -2.4 degreesC. Some frogs were then thawed at 3
   degreesC for 4 hr. Calorimt try revealed that frozen frogs had 53.9% +/-
   11.1% of their body water in ice, and all frogs recovered following this
   procedure. Plasma glucose was low prior to the onset of freezing (1.1
   +/- 0.9 mu moL/ml) and it was 20x higher in postfreeze frogs.
   Constituting nearly 30% of plasma solute, glycerol was 117.2 +/- 13.6 mu
   mol/ml prior to freezing and it remained equally high in postfreeze
   frogs. Liver water content was moderately lower in frozen frogs when
   compared to controls (62.9% +/- 3.7% vs. 68.6% +/- 1.7%), whereas
   postfreeze frogs excessively hydrated their livers (75.7% +/- 2.1%).
   Less-pronounced changes were seen in muscle water content. H. versicolor
   can mobilize its major cryoprotectant, glycerol, in response to extended
   cold acclimation, which is unique in comparison to other freeze-tolerant
   frogs, and it experiences only moderate organ dehydration during
   freezing. This species conforms with other freeze-tolerant frogs,
   however, by mobilizing glucose as a direct response to tissue freezing.

AB The polymerization of actin in filaments generates forces that play a
   pivotal role in many cellular processes. We introduce a novel technique
   to determine the force-velocity relation when a few independent anchored
   filaments grow between magnetic colloidal particles. When a magnetic
   field is applied, the colloidal particles assemble into chains under
   controlled loading or spacing. As the filaments elongate, the beads
   separate, allowing the force-velocity curve to be precisely measured. In
   the widely accepted Brownian ratchet model, the transduced force is
   associated with the slowing down of the on-rate polymerization.
   Unexpectedly, in our experiments, filaments are shown to grow at the
   same rate as when they are free in solution. However, as they elongate,
   filaments are more confined in the interspace between beads. Higher
   repulsive forces result from this higher confinement, which is
   associated with a lower entropy. In this mechanism, the production of
   force is not controlled by the polymerization rate, but is a consequence
   of the restriction of filaments' orientational fluctuations at their
   attachment point.

AB Thermal plasticity can increase thermal limits and may be of central
   importance to the ability of species to cope with future climatic
   changes. However, little is known about the costs and benefits of
   plastic responses of ectotherms and for soil species in particular.
   Here, we examine the costs and benefits [measured as critical thermal
   minimum and maximum (CTmin and CTmax, respectively)] of duration of heat
   and cold hardening and its reversal in the soil arthropod Orchesella
   cincta. Furthermore, we examine the effect of rate of temperature change
   and age of tested individuals. Increasing rates of temperature change
   increased CTmin and CTmax, whereas age had a significant effect only on
   CTmax. There was a strong increase in CTmin and decrease in CTmax with
   duration of cold hardening and vice versa for heat hardening. The time
   course of re-acclimation to 20 degrees C after exposure to 4 degrees C
   for 2 h showed an initial decrease in CTmin, but this effect was gone
   after 96 h. Re-acclimation to 20 degrees C after exposure to 33.4
   degrees C for 2 h showed an initial increase in CTmax and CTmin and
   these costs and benefits were gone after 96 h. These results add to our
   understanding of the costs and benefits of hardening and its reversal in
   soil organisms.

AB The presence of heritable variation in traits is a prerequisite for
   evolution. The great majority of heritability (h(2)) estimates are
   performed under laboratory conditions that are characterized by low
   levels of environmental variability. Very little is known about the
   effect of environmental variability on the estimation of components of
   quantitative variation, although theoretical extrapolations from lab
   studies have been attempted. Here we investigate the effects of
   environmental heterogeneity on variance component estimation using
   full-sib families of Gryllus pennsylvanicus split between a homogeneous
   laboratory environment and a more variable held environment. Although
   large standard errors prevent demonstration of statistically significant
   differences among h(2) of traits measured in the two environments for
   all but one trait, the values of h(2) are, on average, lower in the
   variable field environment, with a mean reduction of 19%. Developmental
   time is an exception, exhibiting high levels of additive variance in the
   field, leading to a higher value of h(2) in the variable environment.
   Underlying the lower held h(2) estimates are greater components of
   environmental variance as expected, as well as lower components of
   genetic variance. In this study, there is no evidence that the increase
   in the environmental component of variance in the held is any more
   important in the reduction of h(2) than is the decrease in the additive
   genetic component. The implications of the relative changes in the two
   components of variance are discussed.

AB The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from podzols (Albic Podzols
   (Arenic)) and the factors controlling its spatiotemporal variability in
   the forest ecosystems of the Pasvik Reserve in the Kola Subarctic are
   characterized. Relatively favorable climatic conditions beyond the polar
   circle in summer are responsible for intensive soil respiration. The
   type of forest affects the emission of CO2 from the soil surface. The
   lowest rate of the CO2 emission is typical of the soils under lichen
   pine forest (105-220 mg C/(m(2) h) or 180 g C/m(2) during the
   summertime). Higher rates are observed for the soils under green moss
   pine (170-385 mg C/(m(2) h) or 360 g C/m(2) during the summertime) and
   birch (190-410 mg C/(m(2) h) or 470 g C/m(2) during the summertime)
   forests. This may related to a higher contribution of root respiration
   (44, 88, and 67%, respectively). Soil respiration and the contribution
   of root respiration to it increase with an increase in the canopy
   density; mass of small roots; microbial biomass; depth of the stony
   layer; soil moistening; and the contents of available carbon, nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium compounds. At the same time, they decrease
   with an increase in the portion of lichens in the ground cover. The
   seasonal dynamics are characterized by the CO2 emission maximums in the
   summer and fall and minimum in the spring. The daily dynamics are
   smoothed under conditions of the polar day.

AB High-latitude fish typically exhibit a narrow thermal tolerance window,
   which may pose challenges when coping with temperatures that shift
   outside of a species' range of tolerance. Due to its role in aerobic
   metabolism and energy balance, the mitochondrial genome is likely
   critical for the acclimation and adaptation to differing temperature
   regimes in marine ectotherms. As oceans continue to warm, there is
   growing need to understand the ability of organisms to respond to
   changing environmental conditions given evidence that some species, in
   particular cold-water species, may already be experiencing difficulties.
   To assess how Arctic gadids in Alaska have responded to differential
   thermal preferences in the past and how regions are interconnected, we
   sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes for four Arctic gadids to
   determine the distribution of mitochondrial diversity and
   population-level structure as well as to detect signatures of selection
   acting on the mitochondrial genome. We found little population-level
   structure within all four species with the clear exception of Gulf of
   Alaska saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Northern localities exhibited
   higher levels of genetic diversity and primarily northern lineages were
   observed within polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and saffron cod, likely
   reflecting asymmetrical dispersal and potentially admixture of distinct
   lineages via ocean currents. The main evolutionary force shaping the
   evolution of the mitogenome appears to be purifying selection, but we
   also identified potential positive selection of candidate amino acid
   replacements primarily in complex I (ND genes) in polar cod. The high
   levels of mitochondrial diversity observed in our study and large
   population size may provide this species with the ability to respond
   evolutionarily (i.e. long-term) to a changing environment.

AB Conservation planning requires setting priorities at the same spatial
   scale at which decision-making processes are undertaken considering all
   levels of biodiversity, but current methods for identifying biodiversity
   hotspots ignore its genetic component. We developed a fine-scale
   approach based on the definition of genetic hotspots, which have high
   genetic diversity and unique variants that represent their evolutionary
   potential and evolutionary novelties. Our hypothesis is that
   wide-ranging taxa with similar ecological tolerances, yet of
   phylogenetically independent lineages, have been and currently are
   shaped by ecological and evolutionary forces that result in
   geographically concordant genetic patterns. We mapped previously
   published genetic diversity and unique variants of biparentally
   inherited markers and chloroplast sequences for 9 species from 188 and
   275 populations, respectively, of the 4 woody dominant families of the
   austral temperate forest, an area considered a biodiversity hotspot.
   Spatial distribution patterns of genetic polymorphisms differed among
   taxa according to their ecological tolerances. Eight genetic hotspots
   were detected and we recommend conservation actions for some in the
   southern Coastal Range in Chile. Existing spatially explicit genetic
   data from multiple populations and species can help to identify
   biodiversity hotspots and guide conservation actions to establish
   science-based protected areas that will preserve the evolutionary
   potential of key habitats and species.

AB Short- and long-term field studies in the vicinity of Poitiers show that
   populations of terrestrial isopods can be characterized by large
   variations, from demographic explosion to extinction. Mechanisms and
   determinants of these variations are not yet clearly explained. These
   could be external features (environmental changes) or internal features
   (disease, parasitism, metapopulational evolution). We have developed a
   realistic simulation program, named DYNISO, which is able to reproduce
   the individual life history of terrestrial isopods according to abiotic
   factors (photoperiod, thermoperiod) and biotic factors (sexual
   interactions, incidence of parasitism, sex ratio distorters, etc.). In
   the model, all biological traits-such as growth, reproduction,
   reactivity to environment, and death-are user-defined. In this study, we
   present some features concerning the life histories of female isopods
   and their implications for population dynamics. We show the capability
   of the model to test genotypes in different geographic locations.

AB Thermal tolerance is one of the major determinants of successful
   establishment and spread of invasive aliens. Merizodus soledadinus
   (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was accidentally introduced to Kerguelen from
   the Falkland Islands in 1913. On Kerguelen, the climate is cooler than
   the Falklands Islands but has been getting warmer since the 1990s, in
   synchrony with the rapid expansion of M. soledadinus. We aimed to
   investigate the thermal sensitivity in adults of M. soledadinus and
   hypothesised that climate warming has assisted the colonisation process
   of M. soledadinus. We examined (1) survival of constant low temperatures
   and at fluctuating thermal regimes, (2) the critical thermal limits
   (CTmin and CTmax) of acclimated individuals (4, 8 and 16A degrees C),
   (3) the metabolic rates of acclimated adults at temperatures from 0 to
   16A degrees C. The FTRs moderately increased the duration of survival
   compared to constant cold exposure. M. soledadinus exhibited an activity
   window ranged from -5.5 +/- A 0.3 to 38 +/- A 0.5A degrees C. The Q (10)
   after acclimation to temperatures ranging from 0 to 16A degrees C was
   2.49. Our work shows that this species is only moderately cold tolerant
   with little thermal plasticity. The CTmin of M. soledadinus are close to
   the low temperatures experienced in winter on Kerguelen Islands, but the
   CTmax are well above summer conditions, suggesting that this species has
   abundant scope to deal with current climate change.

AB Monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology at the regional to
   global scale are essential to understand the characteristics of various
   biophysical parameters in terrestrial ecosystems. Passive optical remote
   sensing data have been used extensively in the recent past to study
   phenology of vegetation, also called land surface phenology, at diverse
   landscapes across the globe. In the present study, the moderate
   resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation
   index (EVI) time series data (2000-2013) was used to study the phenology
   of dry and moist teak (Tectona grandis) forests of different
   biogeographic provinces of India. Four phenology metrics, viz., start of
   season (SOS), end of season (EOS), peak of season (POS) and length of
   season (LOS) were derived using the TIMESAT tool. The SOSs' of dry and
   moist teak were found during July-August. LOS of moist teak was found to
   be much longer (similar to 48 days) than dry teak. Also, a significant
   difference of leaf area index (LAI) (similar to 2.8) of dry and moist
   teak forests was noticed during peak season from MODIS LAI product
   (MOD15A2). Vegetation phenology is greatly responsive to the fluctuation
   of climatic parameters such as rainfall. Hence, preseason cumulative
   rainfall data were analysed to understand the control of rainfall over
   phenological variations in natural teak forests of India. It was noticed
   that rainfall was reasonably well correlated with SOS (R-2 = 0.57-0.72)
   for both types of teak forests. The study highlighted the efficacy of
   time series MODIS EVI data to study the phenological variations in
   different teak forest types of India in a data-limited situation.

AB Intraspecific geographic variation in morphology is common in animals
   along geographic or climatic clines. Local ecological factors are likely
   to act simultaneously at smaller spatial scales, but have hardly been
   contrasted with wide-ranging predictors. We tested here whether the
   morphological variation of Dupont's Larks (Chersophilus duponti)
   responded to ecological parameters at two different spatial scales.
   First, we investigated the effects of geographic and climatic gradients
   over its breeding range. Second, we focussed at a smaller spatial scale
   on a fragmented population and tested additionally several fine-grained
   ecological factors related to key components in the species' habitat.
   Contrary to Bergmann's rule, wing length and cranium size decreased with
   rainfall and increased with aridity and maximum temperature at the large
   scale, so birds tend to be larger at lower latitudes. At the same time,
   wing and tarsus length increased at high elevations where minimum
   temperatures are lower, providing some support to Bergmann's rule. At
   the small spatial scale we failed to detect any relationship between
   body size and positional or climatic variables, nor did food
   availability, intra- and inter-specific competition and predation
   pressure produce any significant effect on morphology. Nevertheless,
   cranium size and wing length differed between habitats as measured by
   soil and vegetation types, and wing length decreased with patch size.
   This later result could be explained in the context of strong habitat
   fragmentation if larger individuals have a higher propensity of
   dispersing or a higher probability of surviving dispersal events. Our
   study indicates that several geographic and environmental sources may
   occur simultaneously at different spatial scales. Further, even at the
   same scale, intraspecific morphological variation may show contrasting
   patterns for climatic, latitudinal, and elevational gradients that make
   their interpretation difficult in the context of ecogeographical rules.
   The effects elicited by aridity, habitat loss, and fragmentation on body
   size should be considered in future studies of global change, as they
   may have serious consequences for the distribution, abundance, and
   ultimately the persistence of birds in arid environments.

AB Ecosystem CO2 fluxes measured with eddy-covariance techniques provide a
   new opportunity to retest functional responses of photosynthesis to
   abiotic factors at the ecosystem level, but examining the effects of one
   factor (e.g., temperature) on photosynthesis remains a challenge as
   other factors may confound under circumstances of natural experiments.
   In this study, we developed a data mining framework to analyze a set of
   ecosystem CO2 fluxes measured from three eddy-covariance towers, plus a
   suite of abiotic variables (e.g., temperature, solar radiation, air, and
   soil moisture) measured simultaneously, in a Californian oak-grass
   savanna from 2000 to 2015. Natural covariations of temperature and other
   factors caused remarkable confounding effects in two particular
   conditions: lower light intensity at lower temperatures and drier air
   and soil at higher temperatures. But such confounding effects may cancel
   out. At the ecosystem level, photosynthetic responses to temperature did
   follow a quadratic function on average. The optimum value of
   photosynthesis occurred within a narrow temperature range (i.e., optimum
   temperature, T (opt)): 20.6 +/- 0.6, 18.5 +/- 0.7, 19.2 +/- 0.5, and
   19.0 +/- 0.6 A degrees C for the oak canopy, understory grassland,
   entire savanna, and open grassland, respectively. This paradigm confirms
   that photosynthesis response to ambient temperature changes is a
   functional relationship consistent across leaf-canopy-ecosystem scales.
   Nevertheless, T (opt) can shift with variations in light intensity, air
   dryness, or soil moisture. These findings will pave the way to a direct
   determination of thermal optima and limits of ecosystem photosynthesis,
   which can in turn provide a rich resource for baseline thresholds and
   dynamic response functions required for predicting global carbon balance
   and geographic shifts of vegetative communities in response to climate
   change.

AB In the Rio de la Plata salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a (chl a), and
   densities (ind. m-3) of the copepods Acartia tonsa and Paracalanus
   parvus were measured from January to November in 2003 by following a
   nested weekly and monthly design. Such sampling yielded two separate
   datasets: (i) Yearly Dataset (YD) which consists of data of one sampling
   effort per month for 11 consecutive months, and (ii) Seasonal Weekly
   Datasets (SWD) which consists of data of one sampling effort per week of
   any four consecutive weeks within each season. YD was assumed as a
   medium-term low-resolution (MTLR) dataset, and SWD as a short-term
   high-resolution (STHR) dataset. The hypothesis was, the SWD would always
   capture (shorter scales generally captures more noise in data) more
   detail variability of copepod populations (quantified through the
   regression relationships between temporal changes of salinity,
   temperature, chl a and copepod densities) than the YD. Analysis of both
   YD and SWD found that A. tonsa density was neither affected by seasonal
   cycles, nor temporal variability of salinity, temperature and chl a.
   Thus, compared to STHR sampling, MTLR sampling did not yield any further
   information of the variability of population densities of the perennial
   copepod A. tonsa. Analysis of SWD found that during summer and autumn
   the population densities of P. parvus had a significant positive
   relationship to salinity but their density was limited by higher chl a
   concentration; analysis of YD could not yield such detailed ecological
   information. That hints the effectiveness of STHR sampling over MTLR
   sampling in capturing details of the variability of population densities
   of a seasonal copepod species. Considering the institutional resource
   limitations (e.g. lack of long-term funding, manpower and
   infrastructure) and the present hypothesis under consideration, the
   authors suggest that a STHR sampling may provide useful complementary
   information to interpret results of longer-term natural changes
   occurring in estuaries.

   to develop a late summer maximum temperature (T-max) reconstruction for
   the Southern Rocky Mountains-a mid-latitude (i.e., 36 degrees N), arid
   region in North America. We reconstruct August-September (AS) T-max for
   the period 1735-2015 CE using a composite latewood BI (LWB) Engelmann
   spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) chronology from multiple
   sites across the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Northern New Mexico, USA.
   This study presents the first BI-derived temperature reconstruction for
   the lower mid-latitudes (30-45 degrees N) of North America. We compare
   the climate response of multiple tree-ring parameters: LWB, earlywood BI
   (EWB), Delta BI (earlywood BI minus latewood BI), ring width (RW), and
   maximum latewood density (MXD). Of an parameters, the site-composite LWB
   and( )Delta BI chronologies show the strongest correlations with AS
   T-max Reconstructed AS T-max demonstrates fluctuating warm and cool
   periods during the latter portion of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1730-1850)
   and pronounced warming through the early to mid-twentieth century (ca.
   1920-1950s). The reconstruction also documents substantial warming over
   the last decade, the trend of which appears to be anomalous within the
   context of the past ca. 280 years. We highlight the potential for BI
   methods to be successfully used at high-elevation, mid-latitude
   locations where temperature proxy datasets are scarce or non-existent.
   As many places across the mid-latitudes lack contiguous, temporally
   resolved, decadal-scale paleotemperature proxies, we suggest here that
   BI methods can be effective at improving the spatial gaps in the
   Northern Hemisphere temperature proxy network.

AB In lizards, one of the most important behavioral mechanisms to cope with
   spatial and temporal variations in thermal resources observed is
   activity time. The longer a lizard can maintain activity, the more time
   it has to forage and reach larger adult body size. We studied the
   behavioral adjustments to different climatic regimens on daily and
   seasonal scales in three natural populations of the lizard Microlophus
   atacamensis along a latitudinal temperature and rainfall gradient. We
   also used Niche Mapper to determinate the amount of thermally suitable
   time for activity for this species. Abundance and daily activity
   patterns varied greatly over the year for the three populations. In
   summer and spring, the daily activity times were greater, and were
   reduced in fall and winter seasons. In summer, when stressful heat loads
   should prohibit activity over a midday gap, lizards did not show bimodal
   patterns of activity. Instead, they move to the cooler intertidal
   habitat. Abundance and thermal quality in the southernmost coolest site
   was lower, and the potential annual activity time decreases with
   latitude. Contrary to expectations, lizards from this locality showed
   the largest body sizes possibly due to diet and/or time to sexual
   maturation. Our results indicate that the intertidal habitat is a key
   factor that influences daily and seasonal activity of M. atacamensis
   lizards. While this habitat is not climatically optimal for lizards, it
   allows them to behaviorally extend their activity window and gain access
   to food in the intertidal areas.

   the nearshore environment. In this study, growth rates of 3 species of
   filter-feeders were examined over a geographic region that includes
   sites where upwelling is typically weak (south of Point Conception,
   California, USA) and sites where upwelling is often strong and frequent
   (at and to the north of Point Conception). The growth of the mussel
   Mytilus californianus, the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes polymerus and
   the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, as well as the body condition of M
   californianus, were all up to 3-6 times higher at sites furthest south
   of Point Conception, and decreased dramatically moving north around the
   point. Spatial variation in food availability (measured as chlorophyll
   a, particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen) and food
   quality (measured as C/N ratios) did not explain these patterns of
   growth. Tidal height of the organisms also failed to account for
   persistent spatial variation in growth rates. Water temperature varied
   in a pattern consistent with growth rates (i.e. mean temperatures were
   warmer in the south), and was the one factor most often selected in
   step-wise regressions for models contributing to patterns of
   filter-feeder growth. This study suggests that factors other than, or in
   conjunction with, productivity may drive large-scale differences in
   benthic filter-feeder growth rates.

AB Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allohexaploid that originated
   from natural hybridization between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum)
   and diploid Aegilops tauschii. Ae. tauschii is considered one of the
   potential sources of new genetic variation in abiotic stress tolerance
   for improving common wheat. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role
   in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. In this study, ABA
   responsiveness of 67 Ae. tauschii accessions and their synthetic
   hexaploid wheat lines, derived from crosses between T. turgidum cv.
   Langdon and the Ae. tauschii accessions, was evaluated based on growth
   inhibition by 20 mu M ABA. Wide variation was found in ABA
   responsiveness for both synthetic wheat lines and their parental Ae.
   tauschii accessions. The variations due to D-genome found at the diploid
   level were also expressed in a hexaploid genetic background. Two pairs
   of synthetic wheat lines differing in ABA responsiveness were then
   selected for gene expression analysis and to test abiotic stress
   tolerance, because their parental Ae. tauschii accessions similarly
   exhibited the differential response to ABA. Gene expression of ABA
   inducible transcription factor, WABI5, and the downstream Cor / Lea
   genes (Wrab17, Wdhn13 and Wrab18) were analysed. In one pair, the highly
   responsive line exhibited higher induction of Wrab17 by ABA treatment,
   but no significant difference in dehydration or salinity tolerance was
   observed between these lines. In contrast, in the second pair, the
   highly ABA-responsive line showed higher levels of Wdhn13 expression and
   dehydration and salinity tolerance. In synthetic wheat lines, the
   difference in the ABA responsiveness of the lines appeared to be
   determined by the different sets of D-genome genes. Our findings suggest
   that highly ABA-responsive Ae. tauschii accessions should be valuable
   genetic resources for improving the abiotic stress tolerance of common
   wheat.

   from those of genetics, we reared imagos from all field populations in a

   The local climate appeared to determine the cold hardiness of the

   geographical location had an effect on the frost resistance
   (supercooling point) of the third-instar larvae of G. variabilis. We
   found no significant differences between the supercooling points of the

   longitude, Sare (-10.9 +/- 4.1 degreesC) and Husson (-11.5 +/- 3.8
   degreesC). Nonetheless, significant differences occurred between the
   larvae originating from the same northern latitude but from separate
   longitudes, Husson and La Robertsau (-17.8 +/- 2.9 degreesC). It is the
   first time that a highly significant difference in the supercooling
   point of one stage within a single species has been observed along
   geographical gradients. Moreover, 19 of the 24 larvae originating from
   La Robertsau were alive after they were kept for 22 h at -10 degreesC
   compared with only 7 of the 24 larvae originating from Sare. When the
   three populations were reared in the laboratory under the same
   experimental conditions, the differential cryoresistance was preserved.
   It is likely that the greater freezing resistance found in the
   third-instar larvae of G. variabilis from La Robertsau could have a
   genetic component.

AB Major biological and biogeographical rules link body size variation with
   latitude or environmental temperature, and these rules are often studied
   in isolation. Within multivoltine species, seasonal temperature
   variation can cause substantial changes in adult body size, as
   subsequent generations experience different developmental conditions.
   Yet, unlike other size patterns, these common seasonal temperature-size
   gradients have never been collectively analysed. We undertake the
   largest analysis to date of seasonal temperaturesize gradients in
   multivoltine arthropods, including 102 aquatic and terrestrial species
   from71 global locations. Adult size declines inwarmer seasons in 86% of
   the species examined. Aquatic species show approximately 2.5-fold
   greater reduction in size per 8C of warming than terrestrial species,
   supporting the hypothesis that greater oxygen limitation in water than
   in air forces aquatic species to exhibit greater plasticity in body size
   with temperature. Total percentage change in size over the annual cycle
   appears relatively constant with annual temperature range but varies
   between environments, such that the overall size reduction in
   aquatic-developing species (approx. 31%) is almost threefold greater
   than in terrestrial species (approx. 11%). For the first time, we
   showthat strong correlations exist between seasonal temperature-size
   gradients, laboratory responses and latitudinal-size clines, suggesting
   that these patterns share common drivers.

   muskox and six caribou populations. In muskoxen, variation in winter
   climate. mediated through the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   explained up to 24% of the variation in interannual abundance, whereas
   in caribou up to 16% was explained by the NAO. Muskoxen responded
   negatively following warm and snowy winters, whereas caribou responded
   negatively to dry winters. Direct and delayed density dependence was
   recorded in most populations and explained up to 32% and 90% of
   variations in abundance of muskoxen and caribou, respectively.

AB Competition for fresh water between agriculture and domestic and
   industrial uses is increasing worldwide. This is forcing subsistence and
   commercial agriculture to produce more with less water. Consequently, it
   is crucial to properly and efficiently manage water resources. This
   requires accurate determination of crop water loss into the atmosphere,
   which is greatly influenced by the exchange of energy and mass between
   the surface and the atmosphere. Measurement of these exchange processes
   can best be accomplished by micrometeorological methods. However, most
   micrometeorological methods are very expensive, difficult to set up,
   require extensive post-data collection corrections and/or involve a high
   degree of empiricism. This review discusses estimation of
   evapotranspiration using relatively inexpensive micrometeorological
   methods in temperature-variance (TV), surface renewal (SR) and
   mathematical models. The TV and SR methods use high frequency air
   temperature measurements above a surface to estimate sensible heat flux
   (H). The latent heat flux (lambda E), and hence evapotranspiration, is
   calculated as a residual of the shortened surface energy balance using
   measured or estimated net radiation and soil heat flux, assuming surface
   energy balance closure is met. For crops with incomplete cover, the
   disadvantage of these methods is that they do not allow separation of
   evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and plant transpiration. The
   mathematical models (single-and dual-source) involve a combination of
   radiation and resistance equations to determine evapotranspiration from
   inputs of automatic weather station observations. Single-source models
   (Penman-Monteith type equations) are used to determine
   evapotranspiration over homogeneous surfaces. The dual-source models,
   basically an extension of single-source models, determine soil
   evaporation and plant transpiration separately over heterogeneous or
   sparse vegetation. These mathematical models have also been modified to
   accommodate inputs of remotely-sensed radiometric surface temperatures
   that enable estimation of evapotranspiration on a regional and global
   scale.

AB The study of insect responses to thermal stress has involved a variety
   of protocols and methodologies that hamper the ability to compare
   results between studies. For that reason, the development of a protocol
   to standardize thermal assays is necessary. In this sense, infrared
   thermography solves some of the problems allowing us to take continuous
   temperature measurements without handling the individuals, an important
   fact in cold-blooded organisms like insects. Here, we present a working
   protocol based on infrared thermography to estimate both cold and heat
   thermal stress in insects. We analyse both the change in the body
   temperature of individuals and their behavioural response. In addition,
   we used partial least squares regression for the statistical analysis of
   our data, a technique that solves the problem of having a large number
   of variables and few individuals, allowing us to work with rare or
   endemic species. To test our protocol, we chose two species of
   congeneric, narrowly distributed dung beetles that are endemic to the
   southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. With our protocol we have
   obtained five variables in the response to cold and twelve in the
   response to heat. With this methodology we discriminate between the two
   flightless species of Jekelius through their thermal response. In
   response to cold, Jekelius hernandezi showed a higher rate of cooling
   and reached higher temperatures of stupor and haemolymph freezing than
   Jekelius punctatolineatus. Both species displayed similar
   thermoregulation ranges before reaching lethal body temperature with
   heat stress. Overall, we have demonstrated that infrared thermography is
   a suitable method to assess insect thermal responses with a high degree
   of sensitivity, allowing for the discrimination between closely related
   species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Re-appraisal of high latitude ice cover during the Weichselian and the
   recent discovery of pre-Holocene plant communities in Novaya Zemlya and
   Northern Norway suggests that the contemporary Arctic flora may have had
   a longer time span in its occupation of high latitude sites than has
   hitherto been recognised. The present-day Arctic flora in some regions
   may therefore have derived at least some of its genetic inheritance from
   populations that survived in ice-free refugia in the high Arctic polar
   deserts during the latter stages of the Weichselian glaciation.
   Increasing evidence for sudden changes in climate at high latitudes in
   the past, suggests that Arctic vegetation would have been subjected to
   rapid climatic warming if it had maintained a presence in these regions
   during the late Weichselian. A review of what is known about plant
   survival in the high Arctic since pre-Holocene times, coupled with an
   examination of some of the physiological properties of modern
   populations in these regions is presented in an attempt to ascertain if
   high Arctic plants possess mechanisms which facilitate their capacity to
   respond either phenotypically or physiologically to climatic change.

AB Understanding the factors that drive geographic variation in life
   history is an important challenge in evolutionary ecology. Here, we
   analyze what predicts geographic variation in life-history traits of the
   common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, which has the globally largest
   distribution range of all terrestrial reptile species. Variation in body
   size was predicted by differences in the length of activity season,
   while we found no effects of environmental temperature per se. Females
   experiencing relatively short activity season mature at a larger size
   and remain larger on average than females in populations with relatively
   long activity seasons. Interpopulation variation in fecundity was
   largely explained by mean body size of females and reproductive mode,
   with viviparous populations having larger clutch size than oviparous
   populations. Finally, body size-fecundity relationship differs between
   viviparous and oviparous populations, with relatively lower reproductive
   investment for a given body size in oviparous populations. While the
   phylogenetic signal was weak overall, the patterns of variation showed
   spatial effects, perhaps reflecting genetic divergence or geographic
   variation in additional biotic and abiotic factors. Our findings
   emphasize that time constraints imposed by the environment rather than
   ambient temperature play a major role in shaping life histories in the
   common lizard. This might be attributed to the fact that lizards can
   attain their preferred body temperature via behavioral thermoregulation
   across different thermal environments. Length of activity season,
   defining the maximum time available for lizards to maintain optimal
   performance, is thus the main environmental factor constraining growth
   rate and annual rates of mortality. Our results suggest that this factor
   may partly explain variation in the extent to which different taxa
   follow ecogeographic rules.

AB During geographic range expansion, populations of non-indigenous species
   at the invasion front may benefit from directing resources away from
   immune defense. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the strength of
   two innate immune components in populations of invasive Cuban Treefrogs
   (Osteopilus septentrionalis) in a long-colonized area (core region) and
   at the invasion front (leading-edge region). First, we compared the
   region-specific metabolic response of frogs injected with an endotoxin
   that induces systemic inflammation (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) to
   sham-injected control frogs pooled from both regions. Males and females
   were analyzed independently because we detected a sex-related difference
   in mass-independent metabolism of control frogs, with males exhibiting a
   significantly higher metabolic rate (F-1,F- 21=29.02, P<0.001) than
   females. We observed a significantly higher metabolic rate in
   LPS-injected core frogs compared with control frogs for both males (P =
   0.041) and females (P = 0.007). Conversely, in leading-edge populations,
   there was no significant difference in the metabolic rate of
   LPS-injected and control frogs (males, P=0.195; females, P=0.132).
   Second, we directly compared bacterial killing ability of frog blood
   plasma between regions. Bactericidal ability of plasma was significantly
   greater in frogs from the core region in comparison with those at the
   leading edge (F-1,F- 26=28.67, P<0.001). For both immune components that
   we examined, populations from the core exhibited stronger immune
   responses. Our findings support hypotheses predicting an inverse
   relationship between immunity and range expansion.

AB The southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, is among the most
   important agents of ecological disturbance and economic loss in forests
   of the south-eastern United States. We combined physiological
   measurements of insect temperature responses with climatic analyses to
   test the role of temperature in determining the northern distribution
   limits of D. frontalis. Laboratory measurements of lower lethal
   temperatures and published records of mortality in wild populations
   indicated that air temperatures of -16 degrees should result in almost
   100% mortality of D. frontalis. The distribution limits for D. frontalis
   approximate the isoline corresponding to an annual probability of 0.90
   of reaching less than or equal to -16 degrees C. Thus, D. frontalis have
   been found about as far north as they could possibly occur given winter
   temperature regimes. At latitudes from 39 degrees N (southern Ohio) to
   33 degrees N (central Alabama), winter temperatures must evert high
   mortality on D. frontalis populations in at least one year out of ten.
   In contrast, we reject the hypotheses that summer temperatures or the
   distribution of host trees constrain the northern distribution of D.
   frontalis. Because of the short generation time of D. frontalis, its
   high dispersal abilities, and the cosmopolitan distribution of suitable
   host trees, changes in either the mean or variance of minimum annual
   temperatures could have almost immediate effects on regional patterns of
   beetle infestations. We estimate that an increase of 3 degrees C in
   minimum annual temperature could extend the northern distribution limits
   by 170 km. Increases or decreases in the variance of minimum annual
   temperatures would further relax climatic constraints on the northern
   distribution limits of D. frontalis. Results emphasize the ecological
   importance of spatial and temporal variability in minimum annual
   temperatures. The physiologically based models provide a tool for
   guiding land management decisions in forests and illustrate a general
   approach for predicting the regional effects of climatic patterns on the
   distribution of organisms.

AB Morningness-eveningness preference can be measured by questionnaires,
   such as the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM). Here, we used data
   from a retrospective sleep-wake diary including many aspects of social
   life during the preceding week to establish further convergent quality
   for the CSM. Participants (N = 570) were students of social science from
   universities in Warsaw and Heidelberg. Morning-orientated students woke
   up, got up and went to bed and slept at earlier hours than more
   evening-orientated students, and experienced less social jetlag.
   Exceptions were sleep onset latency and sleep duration which seemed
   unrelated to morningness-eveningness. More morning subjects, as
   indicated by CSM scores, had earlier first contact with another person,
   went outdoors earlier and started work earlier. They also had earlier
   timing of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The correlations between CSM
   scores and activity indices did not differ between Poland and Germany.
   The data suggest that morning-orientated students exhibiting greater
   morningness preference do, indeed, live on an earlier schedule.

AB Small lizards can accommodate to constraints imposed by temporal changes
   in ambient temperature through a combination of adaptive evolution and
   behavioral and physiological plasticity. Thermal physiology plasticity
   may compensate for climate variation and favor performance while
   minimizing behavioral costs in sub-optimal conditions. The Tandilia's
   lizard, Liolaemus tandiliensis, occurs in an isolated mountain range of
   the Argentinean temperate Pampas. In this study, we compared the thermal
   biology of L. tandiliensis between late spring (December) and mid-summer
   (February). The habitats' thermal quality was lower in late spring than
   in mid-summer. The lizard's field-body temperature (Tb) was 2-3 degrees
   C higher than the operative temperature (Te). Overall, the mean
   preferred temperature (Tsel) was 37.4 degrees C [preferred range (Tset):
   36.2-38.7 degrees C], and was similar to other Liolaemus species. The
   Tset and Tsel of females in late spring were 1.8 degrees C lower than in
   mid-summer. In the case of males, the Tsel did not vary among seasons,
   while the Tset had a difference of 2.5 degrees C between seasons. Adults
   were moderate thermoregulators, but females were more efficient only in
   late spring (E-males = 0.69; E-females = 0.58), compared to mid-summer
   (E-males = 0.68; E-females = 0.50). Juveniles did not show temporal
   differences in temperature preferences and had a relatively higher
   efficiency in late spring (E = 0.38) compared to mid-summer (E = 0.28).
   An increased proportion of juveniles and adults shifted their Tb near to
   the Tset in late spring respect to mid-summer. The adults also matched
   their preferred temperatures to their current body temperature. These
   results suggest that seasonal shifts in the thermoregulatory parameters
   of L. tandiliensis may improve their thermoregulatory efficiency.
   Although temporal variation in ambient temperatures might influence the
   thermal biology of the studied lizards, other factors such as changes in
   the reproductive status may have also interfered.

   the tree canopy. Reducing v(s) to near zero had no effect on E-s and did
   not change the diel hysteretic response to temperature. Diel X-s tended
   to decrease with v(s) and increase with E-s, however, in defoliated
   trees, large increases in X-s, when v(s) approximate to 0, had no effect
   on E-s. We conclude that at this time of the year, E-s is driven
   primarily by respiration of cambium and phloem tissues and that sap flow
   and xylem transport of CO2 had no direct influence on E-s.

AB The relief of dormancy and the promotion of seed germination are of
   extreme importance for a successful seedling establishment. Although
   alternating temperatures and light are signals promoting the relief of
   seed dormancy, the underlying mechanisms of their interaction in seeds
   are scarcely known. By exposing imbibed Arabidopsis thaliana dormant
   seeds to two-day temperature cycles previous of a red light pulse, we
   demonstrate that the germination mediated by phytochrome B requires the
   presence of functional PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7(PRR7) and TIMING OF
   CAB EXPRESSION 1(TOC1) alleles. In addition, daily cycles of alternating
   temperatures in darkness reduce the protein levels of DELAY OF
   GERMINATION1(DOG1), allowing the expression of TOC1 to induce seed
   germination. Our results suggest a functional role for some components
   of the circadian clock related with the action of DOG1 for the
   integration of alternating temperatures and light signals in the relief
   of seed dormancy. The synchronization of germination by the synergic
   action of light and temperature through the activity of circadian clock
   might have ecological and adaptive consequences.
   This work studies the function of alternating temperatures in dormancy
   and germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. We demonstrated that the
   incubation of dormant seeds at 15 degrees C/23 degrees C alternating
   temperature cycles for 2days is sufficient to enhance the light response
   of seeds. The results suggest a functional role for some components of
   the circadian clock related with the action of DOG1 for the integration
   of alternating temperatures and light signals in the relief of seed
   dormancy.

AB Weediness in ephemeral plants is commonly characterized by rapid
   cycling, prolific all-in flowering, and loss of perenniality. Many
   species made transitions to weediness of this sort, which can be
   advantageous in high-disturbance or human-associated habitats. The
   molecular basis of this shift, however, remains mostly mysterious. Here,
   we use transcriptome sequencing, genome resequencing scans for
   selection, and stress tolerance assays to study a weedy population of
   the otherwise nonweedy Arabidopsis arenosa, an obligately outbreeding
   relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. Although weedy A. arenosa is
   widespread, a single genetic lineage colonized railways throughout
   central and northern Europe. We show that railway plants, in contrast to
   plants from sheltered outcrops in hill/mountain regions, are rapid
   cycling, have lost the vernalization requirement, show prolific
   flowering, and do not return to vegetative growth. Comparing
   transcriptomes of railway and mountain plants across time courses with
   and without vernalization, we found that railway plants have sharply
   abrogated vernalization responsiveness and high constitutive expression
   of heat-and cold-responsive genes. Railway plants also have strong
   constitutive heat shock and freezing tolerance compared with mountain
   plants, where tolerance must be induced. We found 20 genes with good
   evidence of selection in the railway population. One of these, LATE
   ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, is known in A. thaliana to regulate many
   stress-response genes that we found to be differentially regulated among
   the distinct habitats. Our data suggest that, beyond life history
   regulation, other traits like basal stress tolerance also are associated
   with the evolution of weediness in A. arenosa.

AB Parent-offspring conflicts are widespread given that resources are often
   limited. Recent evidence has shown that availability of water can
   trigger such conflict during pregnancy in viviparous squamate species
   (lizards and snakes) and thus questions the role of water in the
   evolution of reproductive modes. Here, we examined the impact of water
   restriction during gravidity in the oviparous form of the bimodal common
   lizard (Zootoca vivipara), using a protocol previously used on the
   viviparous form. Females were captured in early gravidity from six
   populations along a 600 m altitudinal gradient to investigate whether
   environmental conditions (altitude, water access and temperature)
   exacerbate responses to water restriction. Females were significantly
   dehydrated after water restriction, irrespective of their reproductive
   status (gravid vs. non-reproductive), relative reproductive effort
   (relative clutch mass), and treatment timing (embryonic development
   stage). Female dehydration, together with reproductive performance,
   varied with altitude, probably due to long term acclimation or local
   adaptation. This moderate water-based intergenerational conflict in
   gravid females contrasts sharply with previous findings for the
   viviparous form, with implications to the evolutionary reversion from
   viviparity to oviparity. It is likely that oviparity constitutes a
   water-saving reproductive mode which might help mitigate intensive
   temperature-driven population extinctions at low altitudes.

AB In order to infer the relationship between the sinking biogenic
   particles as well as planktonic foraminiferal fluxes to local
   hydrography time-series sediment trap observations were conducted at two
   stations, Stations WCT-3 and -7, along the Kuroshio Extension (KE) in
   the northwestern Pacific. The sediment trap samples were collected from
   29 August 1998 to 10 August 1999 at Station WCT-3 and from 19 August
   1999 to 29 August 2000 at Station WCT-7. Large seasonal, spatial and
   depth variations were observed in the total mass flux and the biogenic
   particle fluxes at both stations. The annual mean mass flux in the deep
   trap is similar to3 times higher than that in the shallow trap at
   Station WCT-3 and around twice at Station WCT-7. No distinct seasonality
   of biogenic particles as well as planktonic foraminiferal fluxes was
   observed at WCT-3 except very high fluxes during summer both in shallow
   and deep traps. On the other hand, a distinct bi-modal distribution of
   all biogenic particle fluxes was observed over almost one year at
   Station WCT-7, with a comparatively low value in winter and high peak in
   summer in both shallow and deep traps. The concentration of calcium
   carbonate and the organic matter decreased with depth and those of
   biogenic opal increased with depth at both stations. The increased
   fluxes of all biogenic particles in the deep traps at both stations can
   be explained by lateral transport. The most abundant planktonic
   foraminiferal species at both stations are Neogloboquadrina pachyderma
   (dex. and sin.), Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globigerina bulloides,
   Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globigerinoides
   tenellus, Globigerinella aequilateralis and Globigerinita glutinata.
   Despite some temporal variations in relative abundance, dominant
   planktonic foraminiferal species showed similar distribution pattern
   throughout the year at both stations. Seasonal variation in species
   dominance also occurs at both stations, changing from G. ruber, G.
   tenellus and G. sacculifer in September-November to Globorotalia
   truncatulinoides, Globorotalia inflata and G. glutinata in
   January-April, and to N. pachyderma, N. dutertrei and G. bulloides in
   May-July. The magnitude of test fluxes and species turnover showed
   strong seasonality in accordance with variations in the local
   hydrography, which is influenced by the shift of the meandering Kuroshio
   and by the interaction between the subarctic water mass (Oyashio) and KE
   waters. The influence of local hydrography on the foraminiferal fluxes
   is highlighted by the simultaneous increase in total foraminiferal flux
   with an increase in sea-surface temperature (SST) as well as a
   strengthening in the stratification of the water column. (C) 2004

AB The probability of conception in a given menstrual cycle is closely
   related to the timing of intercourse relative to ovulation. Although
   commonly used markers of time of ovulation are known to be error Drone,
   most fertility models assume the day of ovulation is measured without
   error. We develop a mixture model that allows the day to be
   misspecified. We assume that the measurement errors are i.i.d. across
   menstrual cycles. Heterogeneity among couples in the per cycle
   likelihood of conception is accounted for using a beta mixture model.
   Bayesian estimation is straightforward using Markov chain Monte Carlo
   techniques. The methods are applied to a prospective study of couples at
   risk of pregnancy. In the absence of validation data or multiple
   independent markers of ovulation, the identifiability of the measurement
   error distribution depends on the assumed model. Thus, the results: of
   studies relating the timing of intercourse to the probability of
   conception should be interpreted cautiously.

AB Measures of pelagic, demersal and first-year rings of otoliths belonging
   to two length groups of Argentine bake (Merluccius hubbsi) from the
   oceanic front of the de la Plata River (Argentine Uruguayan Common
   Fishing Zone AUCFZ) were analyzed. One group (individuals smaller than
   25 cm) belonged to the nursery area of the northern sector (34 degrees
   30'-36 degrees 00'S). The other group (individuals larger than 40 cm)
   belonged to the population that can migrate (northward and southward of
   the AUCFZ) and therefore could be found in most of the species
   distribution area. The variables which corresponded to the first length
   group (individuals smaller than 25 cm) presented higher mean values and
   less dispersion for each otolith ring measured (pelagic, demersal and
   first-year) than the second length group (individuals larger than 40
   cm). These differences are significant (p<0.05). Linear and quadratic
   discriminant functions were also significant (p<0.05). Several
   differences between the stocks support the hypothesis of stocks
   separation between different zones within the species distribution area.
   These differences include: otliths rings measurements; different
   latitudinal temperature; different spawing periods, different spawning
   areas and the different lenght of maturity start.

AB Variation of vertebral centra numbers is common in vertebrates.
   Likewise, the number of associated elements such as ribs and neural and
   haemal arches can vary and affect all regions of the vertebral column.
   In mammals, only the number of cervical vertebrae is invariable.
   Variation of total vertebral centra numbers is well documented in
   teleost fish, often related to temperature. Less information is
   available about which part of the vertebral column and which associated
   elements are liable to variation. Here, variation in number of vertebral
   centra and associated elements is studied in Chinook salmon in six
   distinct anatomical regions. Animals are raised at 8 and 12 degrees C to
   ask whether the vertebral centrum numbers, the pattern, and the
   frequency of variation in particular regions are temperature dependent.
   No significant difference concerning the total number of vertebrae was
   found, but regional differences occurred between the 8 and 12 degrees C
   groups. Twelve specimens out of 60 of the 12 degrees C group had three
   postcranial vertebrae compared to only one specimen in the 8 degrees C
   group. The number of transitional vertebrae is significantly different
   in 8 and 12 degrees C specimens. Fewer transitional vertebrae occur in
   more anterior positions in 8 degrees C specimens. Most specimens of both
   temperature groups had two ural centra; however 17 specimens out of 60
   of the 12 degrees C group had up to five ural centra. Specimens of the
   12 degrees C group show more variation in the presence of the vestigial
   ribs associated with transitional vertebrae. Clearly, the postcranial,
   transitional, and ural regions are temperature sensitive. This study
   shows that nonsignificant differences in the total number of vertebrae
   can mask significant regional variation. Variation of vertebral numbers
   could be the consequence of loss or gain of vertebral centra and/or a
   change in the identity of the associated element on the vertebral
   centrum.

AB Despite predicted global warming, the temperature effects on headwater
   stream functioning are poorly understood. We studied these effects on
   microbial-mediated leaf decomposition and the performance of associated
   aquatic hyphomycete assemblages. Alder leaves were incubated in three
   streams differing in winter water temperature. Simultaneously, in
   laboratory, leaf discs conditioned in these streams were incubated at 5,
   10 and 15 degrees C. We determined mass loss, leaf N and sporulation
   rate and diversity of aquatic hyphomycete communities. In the field,
   decomposition rate correlated positively with temperature. Decomposition
   rate and leaf N presented a positive trend with dissolved nutrients,
   suggesting that temperature was not the only factor determining the
   process velocity. Under controlled conditions, it was confirmed that
   decomposition rate and leaf N were positively correlated with
   temperature, leaves from the coldest stream responding most clearly.
   Sporulation rate correlated positively with temperature after 9days of
   incubation, but negatively after 18 and 27days. Temperature rise
   affected negatively the sporulating fungi richness and diversity only in
   the material from the coldest stream. Our results suggest that
   temperature is an important factor determining leaf processing and
   aquatic hyphomycete assemblages and that composition and activity of
   fungal communities adapted to cold environments could be more affected
   by temperature rises. Highlight: Leaf decomposition rate and associated
   fungal communities respond to temperature shifts in headwater streams.

AB The enhanced synthesis of heat-shock proteins (hsps), called the
   heat-shock (or stress) response, is activated when environmental stress
   denatures proteins. Hsp synthesis is activated at the upper temperatures
   of an organism's thermal range and is therefore thought to be critical
   for enhancing thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. Here I
   show, that the two temperate sister species T. brunnea and T montereyi
   that occupy the subtidal and low-intertidal zone differ from the low -
   to mid-intertidal T funebralis (and the subtropical mid-intertidal T.
   rugosa) in (i) heat tolerance, (ii) the onset temperature of their main
   hsp, hsp70 (70 kDa), (iii) the temperature of maximal hsp70 synthesis,
   (iv) the upper temperature of hsp synthesis, and (v) the recovery from a
   thermal stress typical for the mid-intertidal zone. A regulatory model
   in which hsps themselves regulate their own transcription and synthesis
   through a negative autoregulatory feedback mechanism can explain
   acclimation-induced but not interspecific variation in the onset
   temperature of hsp70 synthesis. Transplanting species across their
   vertical distribution limits showed that interspecific differences in
   the stress response are likely to prevent species occurring lower from
   inhabiting sites higher in the rocky intertidal zone. Endogenous levels
   of a hsp of a molecular mass of 72 kDa, hsp72, changed little with heat
   stress in a species' native thermal environment. The results therefore
   confirm the importance of interspecific differences in the stress
   response for setting limits to an organism's thermal environment.
   However, the role of hsps as short-term indicators of sublethal heat
   stress within a species' native thermal environment may, be limited
   without a better understanding of their functional and regulatory
   characteristics.

AB The climate-population relationship has long been conceived. Although
   the topic has been repeatedly investigated, most of the related works
   are Eurocentric or qualitative. Consequently, the relationship between
   climate and population remains ambiguous. In this study, fine-grained
   temperature reconstructions and historical population data sets have
   been employed to statistically test a hypothesized relationship between
   temperature change and population growth (i.e., cooling associated with
   below average population growth) in China over the past millennium. The
   important results were: (1) Long-term temperature change significantly
   determined the population growth dynamics of China. However, spatial
   variation existed, whilst population growth in Central China was shown
   to be responsive to both long- and short-term temperature changes; in
   marginal areas, population growth was only sensitive to short-term
   temperature fluctuations. (2) Temporally, the temperature-population
   relationship was obscured in some periods, which was attributable to the
   factors of drought and social buffers. In summary, a
   temperature-population relationship was mediated by geographic factors,
   the aridity threshold, and social factors. Given the upcoming threat
   posed by climate change to human societies, this study seeks to improve
   our knowledge and understanding of the climate-society relationship.

   life history traits of the poorly known fly Phasmovora phasmophagae
   (Diptera: Tachinidae), a parasitoid of Agathemera crassa (Phasmatodea:
   Agathemeridae) in order to: i) test the effect of ambient temperature on
   life history traits and ii) assess the potential trade-off between
   reproduction and survival. Parasitoids were obtained from a population
   of hosts located in the Andes range of central Chile. Upon emergence
   from the host parasitoids were randomly allocated to three thermal
   treatments (15 degrees C, 22.5 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and several
   life history traits were measured. We recorded higher survival at 15
   degrees C and 22.5 degrees C and a lower survival at 30 degrees C. We
   found differences for both body mass and head width among thermal
   treatments. In females, body mass was higher at 15 degrees C than at 30
   degrees C. An effect of breeding temperature and sex was observed only
   for developmental time. In addition, males reared at different
   temperatures during the pupal stage and held as adults at 22.5 degrees
   C, exhibited no differences in longevity between treatments. A
   significant effect of temperature on the mass of ovaries and lipid was
   recorded in females. These patterns suggest a trade-off between
   reproduction and survival. Overall, data seem to support the "colder is
   better" hypothesis, because Andean parasitoid P. phasmophagae inhabiting
   and experimentally reared in colder environments have a higher
   performance in all environments.

AB Sediment-trap samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico reveal that
   Globorotalia truncatulinoides, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Pulleniatina
   spp. (includes P. obliquiloculata and P. finalis), and the Globorotalia
   menardii group (includes Gt. menardii, Gt. tumida, and Gt. ungulata)
   generally occur in cold months. Globigerinoides ruber (white and pink
   varieties) and Globigerinoides sacculifer occur throughout the year. The
   seasonal occurrence of individual taxa of planktic foraminifers in the
   Gulf of Mexico have important differences with the seasonal occurrence
   of the same taxa observed in a 6-year sediment-trap dataset from the
   western Sargasso Sea. Thus information on the ecologic preferences of
   individual taxa determined in one region cannot necessarily be applied
   directly to another area. In the northern Gulf of Mexico similar to 90%
   of the total flux of Globorotalia truncatulinoides tests to sediments
   occurs in January and February. Mg/Ca and d(18)O measurements indicate
   that nonencrusted forms of Gt. truncatulinoides calcify in the
   upper-surface-mixed zone. Thus, analyses of nonencrusted Gt.
   truncatulinoides in sediments of the northern Gulf of Mexico have
   potential for monitoring past conditions in the winter-surface-mixed
   layer. The relatively low overall abundance of Globigerinoides ruber
   (white) in sediment-trap samples is anomalous because Gs. ruber (white)
   is one of the most abundant foraminifers in >150 mu m census data from
   northern Gulf of Mexico Holocene sediment core samples. Globigerinoides
   ruber (pink) is a relatively persistent and common component of the
   sediment-trap samples. Thus Gs. ruber (pink) has potential as a proxy
   for mean annual sea-surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB Comparisons between historical and recent ecological datasets indicate

   underwent major transformation at the time of the severe 1982/1983 El
   Nino warming event. Heavily grazed reefs with crustose coralline algae
   ('urchin barrens') replaced former macroalgal and coral habitats,
   resulting in large local and regional declines in biodiversity.
   Following recent threat assessment workshops, a total of five mammals,
   six birds, five reptiles, six fishes, one echinoderm, seven corals, six
   brown algae and nine red algae reported from coastal environments in
   Galapagos are now recognized as globally threatened. The 2008
   International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
   includes 43 of these species, while two additional species (Galapagos
   damsel Azurina eupalama and 24-rayed sunstar Heliaster solaris) not seen
   for > 25 years also fulfil IUCN threatened species criteria. Two endemic
   species (Galapagos stringweed Bifurcaria galapagensis and the damselfish
   A. eupalama) are now regarded as probably extinct, while an additional
   six macroalgal species (Dictyota galapagensis, Spatoglossum schmittii,
   Desmarestia tropica, Phycodrina elegans, Gracilaria skottsbergii and
   Galaxaura barbata) and the seastar H. solaris are possibly extinct. The
   removal of large lobster and fish predators by artisanal fishing
   probably magnified impacts of the 1982/1983 El Nino through a cascade of
   indirect effects involving population expansion of grazing sea urchins.
   Marine protected areas with adequate enforcement are predicted to
   ameliorate but not eliminate ecosystem impacts caused by increasing
   thermal anomalies associated with El Nino and global climate change.

TI Decadal-scale variability in populations
SO CLIMATE CHANGE AND SMALL PELAGIC FISH
BP 64
EP 87
PD 2009
PY 2009
AB Decadal-scale dynamics of small pelagic fish populations from five large
   marine boundary currents (Kuroshio, California, Humboldt, Benguela, and
   Canary Currents) and their possible links to climate variability are
   described and compared. Small pelagic clupeiform fish species such as
   anchovies, sardines, sardinellas, herring and sprat are characterized by
   decadal drastic fluctuations of biomass, which are often associated with
   regime shifts in large marine ecosystems and their dynamics are governed
   by long-term, decadal-scale physical processes. Consequently, small
   pelagics are excellent indicators of regime shifts. When occurring in
   the same system, anchovies and sardines usually fluctuate out of phase.
   These shifts between sardine-dominated and anchovy-dominated states seem
   to restructure the entire ecosystem, as concomitant qualitative and
   quantitative changes in ecosystem components other than sardines and
   anchovy populations have been observed. The small pelagic fish seem
   thereby to respond to a bottom-up forcing of the ecosystem which itself
   is driven by changing ocean conditions. Evidence is emerging that these
   ecosystem shifts are associated with large-scale changes in subsurface
   processes and basin-scale circulation. In the Humboldt Current
   ecosystem, the shifts seem to be linked to lasting periods of warm or
   cold water anomalies related to the approach or retreat of warm oceanic
   subtropical surface water (SSW) of high salinity to the coast of Peru
   and Chile. The famous collapse of the Peruvian anchovy around 1970 was
   the result of such a regime shift, not the consequence of the El Nino
   1972/73, which happened after the anchovy decline was already initiated.
   Dynamics of Japanese sardines and anchovies and their Kuroshio Current
   ecosystem exhibit a surprising synchrony with processes in the Humboldt
   system. Although changes in basin-scale circulation must be tightly
   interwoven with climate variability, the direct association of shifts in
   the dynamics of small pelagic fish and their ecosystems and climate
   dynamics and mechanisms linking them, at least in the Pacific, are still
   largely obscure. The climate regime shift observed in 1976/77 in the
   North Pacific did not cause clear reactions in the dynamics of small
   pelagic fish and zooplankton populations of the Pacific boundary
   currents.

AB A live colony of a non-indigenous zooxanthellate scleractinian coral was
   found in shallow water on the west coast of Corsica, western

   species native on near-shore coral reefs in the central Indo-Pacific
   with a high tolerance for low water temperatures at high latitudes.
   Based on its morphology it can be distinguished from other
   zooxanthellate colonial scleractinians in the Mediterranean. O. crispata
   has a reputation of being a successful colonizer because it is able to
   settle on a wide variety of substrata and because it utilizes various
   reproductive strategies as simultaneous hermaphrodite and producer of
   asexually derived planulae. Owing to its original distribution range in
   temperate and subtropical waters, it is likely that it will be able to
   find a suitable temperature regime in the Mediterranean for further

   Schizothorax prenanti were acutely suffered from increasing temperature

   thermal tolerance of Schizothorax prenanti. Antioxidant parameters
   including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), Na+/K+-ATPase and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) in gills, liver and muscle were measured at five
   temperature groups (11 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 26 degrees
   C and 31 degrees C). The plasma hormone including acetylcholine (ACh)
   and cortisol were also measured at five temperature groups. Our results
   showed that the CTMax of Schizothorax prenanti under acute heat stress
   was 31 degrees C.The activities of SOD and CAT in liver and muscle at 11
   degrees C, 16 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 31 degrees C groups were
   significantly higher than 21 degrees C group, as well as Na+/K+-ATPase
   in gills and MDA concentrations in gills and liver. However, plasma ACh
   and cortisol levels were significantly increased with increasing
   temperature. The results indicate that oxidative stress parameters could
   respons to increase of temperatur, altogether reflect that Schizothorax
   prenanti has higher susceptibility of temperature. Thus, the effect of
   long-term high temperature on Schizothorax prenanti should be studied
   further.

AB Occasional XY recombination is a proposed explanation for the
   sex-chromosome homomorphy in European tree frogs. Numerous laboratory
   crosses, however, failed to detect any event of male recombination, and
   a detailed survey of NW-European Hyla arborea populations identified
   male-specific alleles at sex-linked loci, pointing to the absence of XY
   recombination in their recent history. Here, we address this paradox in
   a phylogeographic framework by genotyping sex-linked microsatellite
   markers in populations and sibships from the entire species range.
   Contrasting with postglacial populations of NW Europe, which display
   complete absence of XY recombination and strong sex-chromosome
   differentiation, refugial populations of the southern Balkans and
   Adriatic coast show limited XY recombination and large overlaps in
   allele frequencies. Geographically and historically intermediate
   populations of the Pannonian Basin show intermediate patterns of XY
   differentiation. Even in populations where X and Y occasionally
   recombine, the genetic diversity of Y haplotypes is reduced below the
   levels expected from the fourfold drop in copy numbers. This study is
   the first in which X and Y haplotypes could be phased over the
   distribution range in a species with homomorphic sex chromosomes; it
   shows that XY-recombination patterns may differ strikingly between
   conspecific populations, and that recombination arrest may evolve
   rapidly (<5000 generations).

AB Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of
   several stocks that collapsed in eastern Canada following a long period
   of intensive exploitation. Surplus and net production per capita became
   nil or negative in the mid-1980s so that any level of exploitation would
   have caused a decline of the stock. This was partly explained by a
   marked decline in growth production and is consistent with smaller
   sizes-at-age but also lower condition factor values during the same
   period. Correlations between size-at-age and temperature were not
   significant when corrected for autocorrelation, but slopes were always
   positive, suggesting higher growth rates at higher temperatures. Smaller
   sizes-at-age in the 1980s were not associated with changes in the
   fishery or increased fishing mortality, nor were they consistent with
   the density-dependence hypothesis. Lengths at age 8 decreased by more
   than 10 cm as the stock decreased 10-fold in abundance. While
   size-at-age and temperature covary in cod when all stocks are examined,
   size-temperature relationships are not as clear if the analysis is
   restricted to cold-water stocks, possibly because of differences in food
   availability. Biological production varies from year to year and among
   stocks and should be taken into consideration when managing fisheries in
   variable or extreme environments.

AB Features of embryonic development in birds traditionally have been
   assumed to be shared by sauropsids in general. Herein, we document a
   pattern of yolk processing and cellularization in the Eastern fence
   lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) that is fundamentally different from that
   of birds. In the avian pattern, cells of the yolk sac lining
   phagocytose, and digest yolk material. These cells release products of
   digestion into underlying blood vessels for transport back to the
   embryo. In contrast, microscopic examination of the developing eggs of
   S. undulatus reveals that the yolk mass is converted into vascularized,
   "spaghetti-like" strands that fill the yolk sac cavity. Three successive
   developmental stages are involved. First, the liquid yolk is invaded by
   proliferating endodermal cells, which phagocytose and digest the yolk
   material. These cells form clumps that progressively fill the yolk sac
   cavity. Second, small blood vessels derived from the yolk sac
   vasculature invade the yolk sac cavity. Third, the endodermal cells
   become organized in monolayers around these vessels. This arrangement
   provides a means by which large numbers of endodermal cells can digest
   yolk, with each cell being positioned to release products of digestion
   into an adjacent blood vessel for transport to the embryo. The mechanism
   of yolk processing in this lizard species is similar to that of recently
   studied snakes. From its phylogenetic distribution, we infer that this
   pattern probably is ancestral for squamate sauropsids.

AB A simulation model that predicts the effect of the social, physical, and
   nutritional environments on pig food intake and performance was extended
   to deal with individual variation. The aim was to investigate the effect
   of between-animal variation on the performance of a population of
   growing pigs. Variation was generated in initial state, growth
   potential, and ability to cope when exposed to social "stressors" (EX).
   Variation in initial state is described by initial body weight (BWO),
   from which the chemical composition of the pig is calculated. Variation
   in growth potential is described by creating variation in the genetic
   growth descriptors. Variation in EX exists between genotypes, where it
   has been suggested that leaner, more modern genotype pigs tend to be
   less able to cope. It is expected that within a population or group that
   the social environment (i.e., position within the social hierarchy) also
   affects an individual's ability to cope. In the model, it is assumed
   that the larger, more dominant individuals are better able to cope when
   exposed to social stressors. Consequently, within a population, EX is
   correlated with body weight around the genotype mean. Model predictions
   showed that increasing the variation in BW0 and EX increased the
   variation in pig performance. This is an important practical
   consideration in commercial pig production, where the heterogeneity of
   the population at slaughter may affect the profitability of an
   enterprise. The way a stressor constrains performance determines whether
   the mean population response to a given stressor is the same as the
   average individual response. If all pigs in a group are affected at the
   same stressor intensity (e.g., all are either mixed or not), then the
   predicted average individual and mean population responses will be the
   same. If, however, the intensity of stressor at which performance
   becomes limiting differs between individuals (such as space allowance or
   temperature), differences between the individual and mean population
   responses will be predicted. Variation in the growth response of a
   population was determined to a greater extent by variation in EX and BW0
   than by variation in growth potential, when pigs were housed in
   simulated conditions likely to be encountered in commercial
   environments. Consequently, decreasing the variation in initial body
   weight and improving ability of pigs to cope may be a better way of
   improving pig performance than selecting only for increased growth
   potential.

   North American population of A. solani on pansy (Viola X wittrockiana)
   (Gams.) were determined at six constant temperatures, and comparisons
   were made to previous studies of A. solani from differing geographic
   regions and host crops. On pansy, A. solani developed fastest at 25
   degrees C, passing through the four nymphal instars in an average of 6.9
   d. The highest intrinsic rates of population increase (0.410 and 0.445)
   and shortest population doubling times (1.69 and 1.56 d) were recorded
   at 20 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Average total fecundity remained
   high from 10 to 20 degrees C (74-68 nymphs/adult); a significant
   decrease to 39 nymphs/adult occurred at 25 degrees C. For calculating
   developmental thresholds, we present here a method of adjusting the
   lower developmental threshold (t(min)) using estimates from nonlinear
   models to provide an improved estimate of the thermal constant (K, in
   degree-days). We also call attention to the necessity of using a
   simulation method to estimate the true upper developmental threshold
   (T-max) and optimum developmental temperature (T-opt) from the Lactin-2
   model of temperature-dependent development.

   to -5 degrees C showed high survival (similar to 70%) after 14 d and
   near 50% for up to 56 d at -5 degrees C. Larvae cycled between supra-
   and subzero temperatures showed better long-term survival than at
   constant -5 degrees C. The temperature of crystallization (T-c) was
   similar to-23 degrees C and no larvae survived freezing after reaching
   their T-c. Larvae exposed to inoculative freezing survived brief, mild
   treatments (70% survival of -5 degrees C for 2 h) but survival was
   reduced compared to larvae cooled in the absence of ice. Reduced
   photophase, rapid cold hardening, dehydration, and long-term thermal
   acclimation all improved larval cold hardiness to varying degrees.
   Survival data were compared to measurements of hibernacula conditions,
   and we conclude that larvae face little threat from cold-induced
   mortality but inoculative freezing does pose a risk, and the geographic
   distribution of D. variabilis is only minimally influenced by the
   ability of larvae to survive low temperature exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Transport of the juvenile stages of gadoids by oceanic currents in the
   Barents Sea is governed by interactions between the vertical positioning
   of the fish and the horizontal movement of the water masses. The
   resulting geographical distribution is important for growth and
   survival. There is need for observations at proper temporal and spatial
   scales to improve the representation of vertical distribution in models
   of the transport process. Stationary acoustic systems are suitable for
   this purpose. We use such a system to quantify the vertical dynamics of
   0-group gadoids with reference to a conceptual model of the temporal
   variation. The vertical distribution from the conceptual model is
   applied within a Lagrangian, particle-tracking model. This approach
   performs better in predicting the geographic distribution of the 0-group
   during the first 10 months after hatching than a model with random,
   vertical distribution. The potential of stationary acoustic systems to
   provide high-quality vertical distributions that improve the predictive
   power of the transport model is demonstrated. Extensive sampling
   programmes based on the principles presented here can provide the
   observations needed to obtain more realistic recruitment-prediction
   models.

AB Walleye (Sander vitreus) is a native fish species in North America, and
   its zoogeographic range covers several climatic zones. Using
   multivariate statistical approaches and published growth data, we
   explored the association between climatic conditions (frost frequency,
   precipitation, air temperature, solar radiation, and cloud cover) and
   growth of walleye from 89 populations in North America. We found
   significant concordance between climatic conditions and walleye growth;
   however, the pattern of concordance differed among populations that
   originated from geographical regions that were colonized from different
   glacial refugia. This suggests that contemporary differences in walleye
   growth patterns related to local climatic conditions may have been
   shaped by evolutionary divergence that occurred among refugia during the
   last glaciation. We suggest that caution should be taken when assessing
   possible effects of climate variation and climate change on the life
   history traits of different walleye and other fish populations,
   especially when such assessments potentially include several genetically
   distinct groups. Procrustes analysis was shown to be an effective tool
   for characterizing how a multivariate set of response variables change
   in response to generalized changes in a multivariate set of independent
   variables.

AB A wintertime net sampling and hydrographic survey was conducted in the

   cruise-legs in January-March 2006. Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD),
   expendable CTD (XCTD) and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) surveys were
   conducted to examine the regional hydrographic structure, which included
   a distinct KE front water mass boundary, low-salinity subsurface
   intrusions under and north of the KE current jet, and a deeply mixed
   anticyclonic recirculation zone south of the current. Large
   mouth-opening trawl deployments at 36 stations to the north, within and
   south of the KE collected 1315 leptocephalus larvae, which included
   similar to 51 eel and elopomorph fish species. Leptocephali were most
   abundant/diverse at the southernmost stations at similar to 25-29
   degrees N (29 species), to a lesser extent in the northwestern KE and
   southern area (27 species), but they were not abundant in the current
   jet or northernmost areas. Congrid leptocephali were most
   abundant/diverse (similar to 15 species), with 2 Gnathophis species
   being most abundant, followed by Ariosoma sp. 7, Ariosoma sp. 4, and
   Bathycongrus. Smaller numbers of the Nettastomatidae (Saurenchelys
   stylurus), Muraenidae (12 species), Synaphobranchidae, Chlopsidae (7
   species), Nemichthyidae (Nemichthys spp.), Serrivomeridae and a few
   other families were also collected. Most leptocephali were >50 mm in
   length for non-mesopelagic eel taxa, because they likely originated from
   summer-fall spawning and had been transported offshore by the Kuroshio
   into recirculation areas and farther south possibly by a combination of
   gyre recirculation and eastward countercurrents. Although the exact
   transport scenarios of the larvae of the present study cannot be
   determined, it is possible that some species that spawn along the
   western margin of the subtropical gyre may use Kuroshio recirculation
   areas and the wider subtropical gyre as larval development areas by
   drifting within gyre recirculation before eventually swimming westward
   to their recruitment areas.

AB The extent to which both water source and atmospheric humidity affect
   H-2 values of terrestrial plant leaf waxes will affect the
   interpretations of H-2 variation of leaf waxes as a proxy for
   hydrological conditions. To elucidate the effects of these parameters,
   we conducted a long-term experiment in which we grew two tree species,
   Populus fremontii and Betula occidentalis, hydroponically under
   combinations of six isotopically distinct waters and two different
   atmospheric humidities. We observed that leaf n-alkane H-2 values of
   both species were linearly related to source water H-2 values, but with
   slope differences associated with differing humidities. When a modified
   version of the Craig-Gordon model incorporating plant factors was used
   to predict the H-2 values of leaf water, all modelled leaf water values
   fit the same linear relationship with n-alkane H-2 values. These
   observations suggested a relatively constant biosynthetic fractionation
   factor between leaf water and n-alkanes. However, our calculations
   indicated a small difference in the biosynthetic fractionation factor
   between the two species, consistent with small differences calculated
   for species in other studies. At present, it remains unclear if these
   apparent interspecies differences in biosynthetic fractionation reflect
   species-specific biochemistry or a common biosynthetic fractionation
   factor with insufficient model parameterization.

AB Although climates are rapidly changing on a global scale, these changes
   cannot easily be extrapolated to the local scales experienced by
   organisms. In fact, such generalizations might be quite problematic. For
   instance, models used to predict shifts in the ranges of species during
   climate change rarely incorporate data resolved to < 1 km(2), although
   most organisms integrate climatic drivers at much smaller scales.
   Empirical studies alone suggest that the operative temperatures of many
   organisms vary by as much as 10-20 degrees C on a local scale, depending
   on vegetation, geology, and topography. Furthermore, this variation in
   abiotic factors ignores thermoregulatory behaviors that many animals use
   to balance heat loads. Through a set of simulations, we demonstrate how
   variability in elevational topography can attenuate the effects of
   warming climates. These simulations suggest that changing climates do
   not always impact organisms negatively. Importantly, these simulations
   involve well-known relationships in biophysical ecology that show how no
   two organisms experience the same climate in the same way. We suggest
   that, when coupled with thermoregulatory behavior, variation in
   topographic features can mask the acute effect of climate change in many
   cases.

AB Growth variation was estimated from mean lengths-at-ages 4 and 5 for
   Atlantic cod off Greenland based oil 52 973 fish taken from commercial
   and scientific catches from 1955 to 2002. Mean length-at-age values were
   corrected for area and seasonal effects, and significant growth
   reductions occurred during the 1960s and from the mid-1970s until the
   mid-1980s. Annual growth rates of cod in Greenland waters during the
   most recent decade (1993-2002) were consistently among the highest
   recorded. Statistical growth models accounting for temperature, fishing
   mortality, and stock abundance effects were constructed. Multiple linear
   regressions revealed significant positive temperature effects on growth
   of both age groups and a significant negative stock density effect on
   length-at-age 4. Correlations between exploitation intensity and
   length-at-age were statistically insignificant. During the period
   1955-2002, the number of recruits at age 3 was significantly correlated
   with the Greenland cod spawning-stock biomass, June water temperature
   oil top of Fyllas Bank (West Greenland), and Iceland cod recruitment.
   All factors had a positive effect on the number of Greenland recruits
   and, combined, accounted for 60% of the observed variation, Spawning
   stock size was, by far, the most important factor contributing to
   recruitment variability, while June water temperature below 1 degrees C
   and Iceland recruits below 150 million never coincided with high
   year-class strength in Greenland during the past 50 years. Thus,
   previous conclusions regarding a close relation between the Greenland
   and Icelandic cod stocks might need to be reconsidered in the light of a
   continued recruitment failure in Greenland waters over the two most
   recent decades, despite the improved environmental conditions and
   near-average recruitment of the Icelandic stock. The low precision of
   the recruitment model, however, prevents reliable predictions in the
   short or medium term, but a substantial short-term recovery of the
   Greenland cod stock remains unlikely. (c) 2005 International Council for

AB Animals in nature generally face fluctuating rather than constant
   environmental conditions. When given a choice, animals usually seek to
   minimize the variance of gain. However, it is clear that the avoidance
   of variance in energetic gain depends on several factors, including
   hunger level. While holding the mean prey encountered constant, we
   studied the effect of variance in prey arrival on the growth rates of
   two pit-building antlion species, Myrmeleon hyalinus and Cueta lineosa.
   Both species construct pit-traps in loose soils and ambush small prey in
   the same desert habitats, while differing in their preferred
   microhabitat: shaded vs. exposed to direct sunlight. We expected the
   light-preferring species to better tolerate variance in feeding than the
   shade-preferring species, owing to the former's higher stress tolerance
   and natural occurrence in microhabitats that are more likely poor with
   prey. While increasing variance in prey arrival reduced the growth rates
   of both species, this decrease was more pronounced in the species
   inhabiting the shaded and most likely prey-richer microhabitat. The
   greater variance tolerance of the light-preferring species stems from
   its ability to capture several prey items when almost simultaneously
   encountered. It could also be that this species has lower basal
   metabolic rate, which improves its starvation tolerance. These two
   antlion species differed in their prey capture success, starvation and
   thermal tolerance, and we thus suggest that their tolerance to variance
   in feeding opportunities and functional response offer an additional
   axis that enables them to coexist in the same desert habitats.

AB A general mean annual temperature increase accompanied with substantial
   glacial retreat has been noted on the Tibetan Plateau during the last
   two centuries but most significantly since the mid 1950s. These climate
   trends are particularly apparent on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.
   However, the Tibetan Plateau (due to its heterogeneous mountain
   landscape) has very complex and spatially differing temperature and
   precipitations patterns. As a result, intensive palaeolimnological
   investigations are necessary to decipher these climatic patterns and to
   understand ecological responses to recent environmental change. Here we
   present palaeolimnological results from a (210)Pb/(137)Cs-dated sediment
   core spanning approximately the last 200 years from a remote
   high-mountain lake (LC6 Lake, working name) on the southeastern Tibetan
   Plateau. Sediment profiles of diatoms, organic variables (TOC, C:N) and
   grain size were investigated. The (210)Pb record suggests a period of
   rapid sedimentation, which might be linked to major tectonic events in
   the region ca. 1950. Furthermore, unusually high (210)Pb supply rates
   over the last 50 years suggest that the lake has possibly been subjected
   to increasing precipitation rates, sediment focussing and/or increased
   spring thaw. The majority of diatom taxa encountered in the core are
   typical of slightly acidic to circumneutral, oligotrophic,
   electrolyte-poor lakes. Diatom species assemblages were rich, and
   dominated by Cyclotella sp., Achnanthes sp., Aulacoseira sp. and
   fragilarioid taxa. Diatom compositional change was minimal over the
   200-year period (DCCA = 0.85 SD, p = 0.59); only a slightly more diverse
   but unstable diatom assemblage was recorded during the past 50 years.
   The results indicate that large-scale environmental changes recorded in
   the twentieth century (i.e. increased precipitation and temperatures)
   are likely having an affect on the LC6 Lake, but so far these impacts
   are more apparent on the lake geochemistry than on the diatom flora.
   Local and/or regional peculiarities, such as increasing precipitation
   and cloud cover, or localized climatic phenomena, such as negative
   climate feedbacks, might have offset the effects of increasing mean
   surface temperatures.

AB Variation in local environments may lead to variation in the selection
   pressures and differentiation among local populations even at
   microgeographic scale. We investigated variation in temperature-induced
   plasticity in larval life-history traits among populations of an
   isolated pool frog (Rana lessonae) metapopulation in Central Sweden.
   Successful breeding of this northern fringe metapopulation is highly
   dependent on early summer temperature, however, the metapopulation shows
   very little variation in molecular genetic markers suggesting limited
   potential for local differentiation. We exposed larvae from three
   closely-located populations to two temperatures (20 and 25A degrees C)
   in laboratory to investigate their growth and development responses to
   temperature variation. In general, larvae exposed to warmer temperature
   experienced higher survival and metamorphosed faster, but at a smaller
   size than those at low temperature. We found differences among the
   populations in both trait mean values and in the plastic responses.
   Among-family variation within populations was found in growth rate and
   time to metamorphosis, as well as in plasticity suggesting that these
   traits have a capacity to evolve. Our results indicate ample phenotypic
   variation within and among these closely-located populations despite the
   low molecular genetic variation. The differences in pond temperature
   characteristics detected in the study in the three localities may
   suggest that differential selection is acting in the populations. The
   strong differentiation found in the larval traits implies that
   understanding the factors that influence the potential of the
   populations to adapt to environmental changes may be essential for
   successful conservation strategies.

AB Diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is considered less
   prominent at high latitudes where diel changes in irradiance are minimal
   during periods of midnight sun and polar night, leaving zooplankton
   without a temporal refuge and thus eliminating a key advantage of DVM.
   One of the shortcomings of previous DVM studies of zooplankton based on
   net sampling is that the depth resolution often has been too coarse to
   detect vertical migrations over short distances. We investigated DVM of
   zooplankton during August 2010 in drifting sea ice northeast of Svalbard
   (81.5A degrees N, 30.5A degrees E). Classical DVM behaviour (midnight
   rising, midday sinking) was observed between 20 and 80 m in young
   copepodite stages (CI-III) of Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus
   glacialis. The copepods Microcalanus spp., Pseudocalanus spp., Oithona
   atlantica, Oithona similis and Triconia borealis, alongside Eukrohnia
   hamata, Limacina helicina, and Fritillaria spp., all displayed signs of

AB Projections of climate change impacts on coral reefs produced at the
   coarse resolution (similar to 1 degrees) of Global Climate Models (GCMs)
   have informed debate but have not helped target local management
   actions. Here, projections of the onset of annual coral bleaching
   conditions in the Caribbean under Representative Concentration Pathway
   (RCP) 8.5 are produced using an ensemble of 33 Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase-5 models and via dynamical and statistical
   downscaling. A high-resolution (similar to 11 km) regional ocean model
   (MOM4.1) is used for the dynamical downscaling. For statistical
   downscaling, sea surface temperature (SST) means and annual cycles in
   all the GCMs are replaced with observed data from the similar to 4-km
   NOAA Pathfinder SST dataset. Spatial patterns in all three projections
   are broadly similar; the average year for the onset of annual severe
   bleaching is 2040-2043 for all projections. However, downscaled
   projections show many locations where the onset of annual severe
   bleaching (ASB) varies 10 or more years within a single GCM grid cell.
   Managers in locations where this applies (e.g., Florida, Turks and
   Caicos, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, among others) can
   identify locations that represent relative albeit temporary refugia.
   Both downscaled projections are different for the Bahamas compared to
   the GCM projections. The dynamically downscaled projections suggest an
   earlier onset of ASB linked to projected changes in regional currents, a
   feature not resolved in GCMs. This result demonstrates the value of
   dynamical downscaling for this application and means statistically
   downscaled projections have to be interpreted with caution. However,
   aside from west of Andros Island, the projections for the two types of
   downscaling are mostly aligned; projected onset of ASB is within +/-10
   years for 72% of the reef locations.

   correspond with enhanced coastal upwelling. CMIP5 model projections for

AB Body size is a key functional trait that is predicted to decline under
   warming. Warming is known to cause size declines via phenotypic
   plasticity, but evolutionary responses of body size to warming are
   poorly understood. To test for warming-induced evolutionary responses of
   body size and growth rates, we used populations of mosquitofish
   (Gambusia affinis) recently established (less than 100 years) from a
   common source across a strong thermal gradient (19-33 degrees C) created
   by geothermal springs. Each spring is remarkably stable in temperature
   and is virtually closed to gene flow from other thermal environments.
   Field surveys show that with increasing site temperature, body size
   distributions become smaller and the reproductive advantage of larger
   body size decreases. After common rearing to reveal recently evolved
   trait differences, warmer-source populations expressed slowed juvenile
   growth rates and increased reproductive effort at small sizes. These
   results are consistent with an adaptive basis of the plastic
   temperature-size rule, and they suggest that temperature itself can
   drive the evolution of countergradient variation in growth rates. The
   rapid evolution of reduced juvenile growth rates and greater
   reproduction at a small size should contribute to substantial body
   downsizing in populations, with implications for population dynamics and
   for ecosystems in a warming world.

AB The role phenotypic plasticity might play in adaptation to the ongoing
   climate changes is unclear. Plasticity allows for the production of a
   diversity of intra-generational responses, whose inter-generational
   evolutionary consequences are difficult to predict. In this article, we
   review theory and empirical studies addressing this question in insects
   by considering three scenarios. The first scenario corresponds to
   adaptive plasticity that should lead to slow or no evolution. The second
   scenario is the case of non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity to new
   environmental conditions that should lead either to extinction or, on
   the contrary, to rapid evolutionary change. The third scenario deals
   with how plasticity alters the variance selection acts upon. These
   scenarios are then discussed by highlighting examples of empirical
   studies on insects. We conclude that more studies are needed to better
   understand the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and
   evolutionary processes in insects.

AB This research aims at providing a statistical framework for detection
   and attribution of climate variability and change at regional scale when
   at least 30 years of observation data are available. While extensive
   research has been done on detecting significant observed trends in
   hydroclimate variables and attribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions in large continents, less attention has been paid for regional
   scale analysis. The latter is mainly important for adaptation to climate
   change in different sectors including but not limited to energy,
   agriculture, and water resources planning and management, and it is
   still an open discussion in many countries including the West Asian
   ones. In the absence of regional climate models, an informative
   framework is suggested providing useful insights for policymakers. It
   benefits from general flexibility, not being computationally expensive,
   and applying several trend tests to analyze temporal variations in
   temperature and precipitation (gradual and step changes). The framework
   is implemented for a very important river basin in the west of Iran. In
   general, some increasing and decreasing trends of the interannual
   precipitation and temperature have been detected. For precipitation
   annual time series, a reducing step was seen around 1996 compared with
   the gradual change in most of the stations, which have not experience a
   dramatical change. The range of natural forcing is found to be +/- 76 %
   for precipitation and +/- 1.4 A degrees C for temperature considering a
   two-dimensional diagram of precipitation and temperature anomalies from
   1000-year control run of global climate model (GCM). Findings out of
   applying the proposed framework may provide useful insights into how to
   approach structural and non-structural climate change adaptation
   strategies from central governments.

AB Coral bleaching is often characterized by high spatial variation across
   reef systems. Using a field survey and manipulative experiment, we
   tested whether the physical structure of coral reefs modifies
   environmental conditions that, in turn, influence spatial variation in
   bleaching in 3 scleractinian corals, Pocillopora verrucosa, Acropora
   elseyi, and Porites rus. Corals inhabit mainly the hard-bottom seafloor,
   or dead or partially dead coral heads ('bommies'). Bommies (0.10 to 3.0
   m tall) position corals at different water depths and expose them to
   differences in light, temperature, hydrodynamics, and sedimentation,
   factors that can influence patterns of bleaching. We conducted our Study
   in association with a 14 d warming event that caused bleaching in
   lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia. Bleaching in naturally occurring
   colonies of Pocillopora spp. and Acopora spp. was greater on the
   seafloor (0 m tall) than on short (0.35 to 0.40 m tall) and tall bommies
   (1.0 to 1.2 m tall). Bleaching in P. verrucosa and A. elseyi
   transplanted to reef structures in the experiment generally decreased
   with increasing reef height (seafloor > short bommies > tall bommies).
   P. rus did not bleach under any conditions observed. Regression analyses
   revealed that reef structure controlled current speed and sedimentation
   at the microhabitat scale (from centimeters to meters), and that these
   factors regulated bleaching and mortality in P. verrucosa and A. elseyi.
   Our results imply that the physical structure of shallow water reef
   habitat influences the performance of coral colonies by modifying
   environmental stress, and that accounting for this structure is
   important in managing coral reef systems.

AB Population fecundity can vary through time, sometimes owing to changes
   in adult condition. Consideration of these fecundity changes can improve
   understanding of recruitment variation. Herein, we estimated fecundity
   of Lake Michigan bloater Coregonus hoyi during December 2005 and
   February 2006. Bloater recruitment has been highly variable from 1962 to
   present, and consistently poor since 1992. We compared our fecundity vs.
   weight regression to a previously published regression that used fish
   sampled in October 1969. We wanted to develop a new regression for two
   reasons. First, it should be more accurate because it uses fish
   collected closer to spawning, thus minimizing the potential for atresia
   (egg reabsorption) which could bias fecundity high. Second, we
   hypothesized that fecundity would be lower in 2006 because adult
   condition was 41% lower in 2006 compared to 1969, likely owing to the
   decline of Diporeia spp, a primary prey for bloater. Although the slope
   of the fecundity versus weight regression was similar between the years,
   fecundity was 24% lower in 2006 than in 1969 for bloater weighing
   between 70 and 240 g. Whether this was the result of the difference in
   sampling time prior to spawning or of differences in condition is
   unknown. We also found no relationship between maternal size and mature
   oocyte size. Incorporating our updated fecundity regression into a
   stock/recruit model failed to improve the model fit, indicating that the
   low bloater recruitment that has been observed since the early 1990s is
   not solely the result of reduced fecundity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

AB In South America, the and and semiarid subtropical regions through the
   Atacama Desert and north-central Chile between 19 degrees and 32 degrees
   S are currently a gap in the tree-ring chronology network. Only a short
   tree-ring chronology has been published for this vast region and little
   is known about the suitability of many woody species for tree-ring
   analysis and dendroclimatology. In this paper we present the first
   detailed analysis of the climate responses and influences of the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (PDO) on the tree-rings of three species new to dendrochronology and
   that typically occur at high elevations in the Andes of central and
   north-central Chile. Three well-replicated tree-ring chronologies of
   Kageneckia angustifolia, Proustia cuneifolia and Fabiana imbricata are
   compared with century-long regional records of precipitation and
   temperature, and with the N3.4 SST and PDO indices in both time and
   frequency-domains using correlation and wavelet analysis. The radial
   growth of these species is controlled by winter precipitation and is
   also positively correlated with temperature during most of the rainy
   season from April to September (autumn-spring). The regional climate as
   well as tree growth is strongly modulated by ENSO and ENSO-like
   conditions in the equatorial Pacific at both interannual and
   interdecadal timescales. The decadal and interdecadal variability is not
   correlated with PDO and appears to be related to the Interdecadal
   Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a Pacific-wide ENSO-like mode of climate
   variability. Despite their relatively short lifespans, these three new
   species have a high potential for dendrochronological and dendroclimatic
   studies in the semiarid region of Chile over the last two centuries. (C)

AB A better understanding of the respective role of key climatic variables
   on tree growth is crucial for an accurate assessment of how ongoing
   global changes may affect both dynamics and distribution of forest tree
   species in the future. The aim of this study was (i) to explore growth
   patterns of European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) through a network of
   tree-ring chronologies developed for the French Alps and (ii) to
   identify the main climatic drivers explaining radial growth.
   Climate-growth relationships were coupled with a hierarchical analysis.
   This relationship revealed significant variability expressed spatially
   by the existence of five clusters, initially discriminated by an
   elevational contrast related to (i) a negative correlation between
   summer temperatures and larch growth at lower elevations and (ii) a
   stronger response of low-elevation larch stands to winter precipitation.
   In the high-elevation clusters, tree growth depends on previous autumn
   and current summer temperatures and water supply in July. The
   differentiation, that portrays a strong geographical coherence, is
   mainly related to the latitudinal gradient; (i) the northwestern stands
   arc mostly sensitive to high temperatures in summer; (ii) the growth of
   the southernmost clusters is equally driven by temperatures during
   autumn, winter, and summers; (iii) the populations of a cluster located
   in a transitional zone of the inner French Alps, subject to both
   Mediterranean and Continental influences, exhibit negative correlations
   to late winter and early spring precipitation. This significant spatial
   heterogeneity of climate-tree ring relationships in L. decidua clearly
   underlines the high plasticity of the species to adapt its growth to
   local climate conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained by using an extensive
   radiolarian census dataset from the Nordic (Greenland, Norwegian, and
   Iceland) Seas. The regressions between observed and predicted Summer Sea
   Temperature (SST) indicate that lower error margins and better
   correlation coefficients are obtained for 100 m (SST100) compared to 10
   m (SST10) water depth, and by using a subset of species instead of all
   species. The trained ANNs were subsequently applied to radiolarian data
   from two Norwegian Sea cores, HM 79-4 and MD95-2011, for reconstructions
   of SSTs through the last 15,000 years. The reconstructed SST is quite
   high during the Bolling-Allerod, when it reaches values only found later
   during the warmest phase of the Holocene. The climatic transitions in
   and out of the Younger Dryas are very rapid and involve a change in
   SST100 of 6.2 and 6.8 degrees C, taking place over 440 and 140 years,
   respectively. SST100 remains at a maximum during the early Holocene, and
   this Radiolarian Holocene Optimum Temperature Interval (RHOTI) predates
   the commonly recognized middle Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO). During
   the 8.2 ka event, SST100 decreases by ca. 3 degrees C, and this episode
   marks the establishment of a cooling trend, roughly spanning the middle
   Holocene (until ca. 4.2 ka). Successively, since then and through the
   late Holocene, SST100 follows instead a statistically significant
   warming trend. The general patterns of the reconstructed SSTs agree
   quite well with previously obtained results based on application of
   Imbrie and Kipp Transfer Functions (IKTF) to the same two cores for
   SST0. A statistically significant cyclic component of our SST record
   (period of 278 years) has been recognized. This is close to the de Vries
   or Suess cycle, linked to solar variability, and documented in a variety
   of other high-resolution Holocene records. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Vegetation net primary production (NPP) derived from a carbon model
   (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, CASA) and its interannual change in
   the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau were investigated in this study
   using 1982-1999 time series data sets of normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) and paired ground-based information on
   vegetation, climate, soil, and solar radiation. The 18-year averaged
   annual NPP over the plateau was 125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), decreasing from
   the southeast to the northwest, consistent with precipitation and
   temperature patterns. Total annual NPP was estimated between 0.183 and
   0.244 Pg C over the 18 years, with an average of 0.212 Pg C (1 Pg =
   10(15) g). Two distinct periods (1982-1990 and 1991-1999) of NPP
   variation were observed, separated by a sharp reduction during
   1990-1991. From 1982 to 1990, annual NPP did not show a significant
   trend, while from 1991 to 1999 a marked increase of 0.007 Pg C yr(-2)
   was observed. NPP trends for most vegetation types resembled that of the
   whole plateau. The largest annual NPP increase during 1991-1999 appeared
   in alpine meadows, accounting for 32.3% of the increment of the whole
   region. Changes in solar radiation and temperature significantly
   influenced NPP variation, suggesting that solar radiation may be one of
   the major factors associated with changes in NPP.

AB Body size, coupled with abundance and taxonomy, may help to understand
   the mechanisms shaping community structure. Since the body size of fish
   is closely related to their trophic niche, size diversity (based on
   individual body size) of fish communities may capture intraspecific
   variations in fish trophic niches that are not detected by species
   diversity. Thus, the relationship between size diversity and species
   diversity may help to integrate variation at both intraspecific and
   interspecific levels. We studied the relationship between species
   diversity and size diversity as a measure of the degree of overlap in
   size among species and thereby the potential overlap in niches in a
   community. We hypothesized that the relationship between size diversity
   and species would be different across the European continent due to
   different levels of size overlap in fish communities. The data were
   derived from samplings of fish communities using standardised benthic
   gill nets in 363 lakes. At the continental scale, size diversity
   increased with species diversity; at the ecoregion scale, the slope of
   the relation changed across the continent, with the greatest mismatch
   occurring in northern Europe where communities comprised only one or a
   few species, but each of which exhibited a great range in size. There
   was an increase in slope towards the south with significant relations
   for four out of six ecoregions. The steeper size diversity-species
   diversity slope at lower latitudes is attributable to a lower overlap in
   fish size and thus likely to finer niche separation. Our results also
   suggest that size diversity is not a strong surrogate for species
   diversity in European lake fish communities. Thus, particularly in fish
   communities composed of few species, measuring size diversity may help
   to detect potential functional variation which may be neglected by
   measuring species diversity alone.

AB Background Many organisms are responding to climate change with dramatic
   range shifts, involving plastic and genetic changes to cope with novel
   climate regimes found at higher latitudes. Using experimental lineages
   of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial
   phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable
   conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity
   contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel
   climates. Results We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve
   during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more
   variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however,
   associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions,
   resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the
   ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast,
   lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures
   over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold
   tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions We propose that thermal
   adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates
   found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic
   compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages
   of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal
   adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile
   evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic
   assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on
   existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal
   tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these
   traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.

AB 1. A series of studies was conducted to characterize thermal and
   cardiovascular responses to nicotinic acid (NA) ingestion (5 mg .
   kg(-1)) in healthy subjects: (a) at rest, seated (T-a = 30 degrees C, RH
   = 23%) at 0800 h and again between 1800 and 2100 h; (b) at rest and
   during seated exercise (T-a = 29 degrees C, RH = 30%); and (c) during
   upright exercise when wearing a protective clothing system (T-a = 28
   degrees C, RH = 30%).
   2. (a) NA ingestion decreased esophageal (T-es) and arterial pressure
   and increased mean skin temperature ((T) over bar(sk)), skin blood flow
   (SkBF), forearm blood flow (FBF), heart rate, and cutaneous vascular
   conductance (P < 0.05) in the morning and evening. In the evening 2/4
   subjects experienced substantial hypotension. (b) At rest, peak SkBF and
   peak FBF were 600% higher in NA than control while T-es was 0.6 degrees
   C lower and (T) over bar(sk), was 0.6 degrees C higher after NA (P <
   0.05). During seated exercise, SkBF and FBF were 30% higher and T-es was
   0.3 degrees C lower after NA than control (P < 0.05). (c) During upright
   exercise, NA increased SkBF in subjects clothed in protective clothing.
   3. Vascular responsiveness to NA was enhanced in the evening as shown by
   the increased hypotensive effect of NA in the evening. NA ingestion
   effectively increased sensible heat flux during rest, seated exercise
   and upright exercise. However, manipulation of SkBF by NA ingestion
   should be done cautiously, especially when NA will be used in novel
   circumstances.

AB Microelectrode and voltage-clamp techniques were modified to record
   spontaneous electrical activity and ionic currents of Lymnea stagnalis
   neurons during exposure to a 900-MHz field in a waveguide-based
   apparatus.  The field was pulse-modulated at repetition rates ranging
   from 0.5 to 110 pps, or it was applied as a continuous wave (CW).  When
   subjected to pulsed waves (PW), rapid, burst-like changes in the firing
   rate of neurons occurred at SARs of a few W/kg.  If the burst-like
   irregularity was present in the firing rate under control conditions,
   irradiation enhanced its probability of occurrence.  The effect was
   dependent on modulation, but not on modulation frequency, and it had a
   threshold SAR near 0.5 W/kg.  CW radiation had no effect on the firing
   rate pattern at the same SAR.  Mediator-induced, current activation of
   acetyl-choline, dopamine, serotonin, or gamma-aminobutyric-acid
   receptors of the neuronal soma was not altered during CW or PW exposures
   and, hence, could not have been responsible for the bursting effect.

   comparison on broad geographic patterns of preferred body temperature
   and critical thermal maximum in a giant spiny-frog Paa spinosa. We found
   a bimodal pattern of preferred body temperature during the day, with
   high preferred body temperature during the inactive diurnal period and
   low temperature during the active nocturnal period. There were
   significant differences among six populations of P. spinosa in preferred
   body temperatures, which decreased along a south to north gradient.
   Unlike preferred body temperatures, critical thermal maximum did not
   differ between frogs from the six localities. Although not all
   characteristics of thermal physiology in P. spinosa underwent parallel
   changes between the populations, the shift of preferred body
   temperatures suggests that the features of thermal physiology in the
   frog may change along a latitudinal gradient in response to different
   thermal environments.

AB The grain traits of Yamadanishiki, an excellent sake-brewing rice
   cultivar in Japan, are governed by multiple QTLs, namely, a total of 42
   QTLs including six major QTLs.
   Japanese rice wine (sake) is produced using brewing rice (Oryza sativa
   L.) that carries traits desirable for sake-brewing, such as a larger
   grain size and higher white-core expression rate (WCE) compared to
   cooking rice cultivars. However, the genetic basis for these traits in
   brewing rice cultivars is still unclear. We performed analyses of
   quantitative trait locus (QTL) of grain and days to heading over 3 years
   on populations derived from crosses between Koshihikari, a cooking rice,
   and Yamadanishiki, an excellent sake-brewing rice. A total of 42 QTLs
   were detected for the grain traits, and the Yamadanishiki alleles at 16
   QTLs contributed to larger grain size. Two major QTLs essential for
   regulating both 100-grain weight (GWt) and grain width (GWh) were
   harbored in the same regions on chromosomes 5 and 10. An interaction was
   noted between the environment and the QTL associated with WCE on
   chromosome 6, which was detected in two of 3 years. In addition, two
   QTLs for WCE on chromosomes 3 and 10 overlapped with the QTLs for GWt
   and GWh, suggesting that QTLs associated with grain size also play an
   important role in the formation of white-core. Despite differences in
   the rate of grain growth in both Koshihikari and Yamadanishiki across 2
   years, the WCE in Yamadanishiki remained consistent, thus demonstrating
   that the formation of white-core does not depend on grain filling speed.
   These data can be informative for programs involved in breeding better
   cooking and brewing rice cultivars.

AB Much recent work on avian physiological adaptation to desert
   environments has focused on larks (Passeriformes: Alaudidae). We tested
   the prediction that the threatened red lark (Calendulauda burra), a
   species restricted to very arid parts of South Africa and which is not
   known to drink, exhibits highly efficient evaporative cooling and makes
   pronounced use of facultative hyperthermia when exposed to high air
   temperatures (T-a). We also predicted that C. burra possesses similarly
   low basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total evaporative water loss (EWL) at
   moderate T-a as reported for species from the deserts of the Middle
   East. Rest-phase thermoregulation in C. burra was characterized by an
   unusually low lower critical limit of thermoneutrality at T-a=21 degrees
   C and a BMR of 0.317 +/- 0.047W, the lowest BMR relative to
   allometrically-expected values yet reported in any lark. During the
   diurnal active phase, red larks were able to tolerate T-a up to 50
   degrees C, with the onset of panting occurring at T-a = 38 degrees C.
   Maximum EWL was 1.475 +/- 0.107g h(-1) at T-a = 50 degrees C, equivalent
   to 620% of minimum EWL at thermoneutrality. The maximum ratio of
   evaporative heat dissipation to metabolic heat production was 1.58, a
   value towards the lower end of the range reported for passerines. Our
   data support the prediction that C. burra shows metabolic traits similar
   to those of other larks inhabiting extremely arid climates, but not the
   notion that evaporative cooling at high T-a in this species is more
   efficient than in most passerines.

AB Insect phenology is affected by climate change and main responses are
   driven by phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary changes. Any
   modification in seasonal activity in one species can have consequences
   on interacting species, within and among trophic levels. In this
   overview, we focus on synchronisation mismatches that can occur between
   tightly interacting species such as hosts and parasitoids or preys and
   predators. Asynchronies happen because species from different trophic
   levels can have different response rates to climate change. We show that
   insect species alter their seasonal activities by modifying their
   life-cycle through change in voltinism or by altering their development
   rate. We expect strong bottom-up effects for phenology adjustments
   rather than top-down effects within food-webs. Extremely complex
   outcomes arise from such trophic mismatches, which make consequences at
   the community or ecosystem levels tricky to predict in a climate change
   context. We explore a set of potential consequences on population
   dynamics, conservation of species interactions, with a particular focus
   on the provision of ecosystem services by predators and parasitoids,
   such as biological pest control.

AB The Czech Republic's Giant Mountains are a unique locality for studying
   snow algae because representatives of both significant genera,
   Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas (Chlorophyta), are regularly found there
   and are capable of completing their life cycle in several weeks.
   Physical and chemical environmental characteristics of two sites were
   measured in June 2008 and the photochemical processes of the snow algae
   were studied using variable chlorophyll fluorescence techniques.
   Correlations between the environmental conditions and the rapid light
   curve parameters were evaluated. The environment was characterized by
   stable snow temperature (T-snow; -0.6 to -0.3 degrees C) but variable
   air temperature (T-air; 4.3 to 15.3 degrees C), photosynthetically
   active radiation (PAR; maximum of approximately 2000 mu mol m(2) s(-1)),
   and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 0.135 to 2.27 mW cm(-2)). The snow
   chemical composition at both experimental sites was similar, regardless
   of whether snow algae were present or not, and the nutrient
   concentrations resembled mesotrophic to eutrophic water. Only
   concentration of P-PO43- was significantly higher in the presence of
   algae. Vegetative and mating cells of Chloromonas cf. nivalis were
   observed on the snow surface down to a depth of 6 cm. The maximum
   quantum yield in a range from 0.479 to 0.624 indicated only minor or no
   stress conditions. While the relative electron transfer rate (142 to
   241) and the initial slope (0.287 to 0.505 mu mol(-1) m(2) s(1)) were
   negatively related to T-air, PAR, and UVR, the saturation irradiance
   values were very stable (350 to 489 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Various
   strategies of acclimation to high PAR and/or UVR at different stages of
   the life cycle are proposed.

AB Presently, climate change has increased the frequency of extreme
   meteorological events such as tropical cyclones. In the western Pacific
   basin, these cyclones are called typhoons, and in this area, around
   Taiwan Island, their frequency has almost doubled since 2000. When
   approaching landmasses, typhoons have devastating effects on coastal
   vegetation. The increased frequency of these events has challenged the
   survival of coastal plant species and their posttyphoon recovery. In
   this study, a population of coastal gynodioecious Ficus pedunculosa var.
   mearnsii (Mearns fig) was surveyed for two years to investigate its
   recovery after Typhoon Morakot, which occurred in August 2009. Similar
   to all the Ficus species, the Mearns fig has an obligate mutualistic
   association with pollinating fig wasp species, which requires syconia
   (the closed Ficus inflorescence) to complete its life cycle. Moreover,
   male gynodioecious fig species produces both pollen and pollen vectors,
   whereas the female counterpart produces only seeds. The recovery of the
   Mearns fig was observed to be rapid, with the production of both leaves
   and syconia. The syconium: leaf ratio was greater for male trees than
   for female trees, indicating the importance of syconium production for
   the wasp survival. Pollinating wasps live for approximately 1 day;
   therefore, receptive syconia are crucial. Every typhoon season, few
   typhoons pass by the coasts where the Mearns fig grows, destroying all
   the leaves and syconia. In this paper, we highlight the potential
   diminution of the fig population that can lead to the extinction of the
   mutualistic pair of species. The effects of climate change on coastal
   species warrant wider surveys.

AB 1. Evolutionary adaptation as a response to climate change is expected
   for fitness-related traits affected by climate and exhibiting genetic
   variance. Although the relationship between warmer spring temperature
   and earlier timing of reproduction is well documented, quantifications
   and predictions of the impact of global warming on natural selection
   acting on phenology in wild populations remain rare. If global warming
   affects fitness in a similar way across individuals within a population,
   or if fitness consequences are independent of phenotypic variation in
   key-adaptive traits, then no evolutionary response is expected for these
   traits.
   2. Here, we quantified the selection pressures acting on laying date
   during a 24-year monitoring of blue tits in southern Mediterranean
   France, a hot spot of climate warming. We explored the temporal
   fluctuation in annual selection gradients and we determined its
   temperature-related drivers.
   3. We first investigated the month-specific warming since 1970 in our
   study site and tested its influence on selection pressures, using a
   model averaging approach. Then, we quantified the selection strength
   associated with temperature anomalies experienced by the blue tit
   population.
   4. We found that natural selection acting on laying date significantly
   fluctuated both in magnitude and in sign across years. After identifying
   a significant warming in spring and summer, we showed that warmer daily
   maximum temperatures in April were significantly associated with
   stronger selection pressures for reproductive timing. Our results
   indicated an increase in the strength of selection by 46% for every +1
   degrees C anomaly.
   5. Our results confirm the general assumption that recent climate change
   translates into strong selection favouring earlier breeders in passerine
   birds. Our findings also suggest that differences in fitness among
   individuals varying in their breeding phenology increase with climate
   warming. Such climate-driven influence on the strength of directional
   selection acting on laying date could favour an adaptive response in
   this trait, since it is heritable.

AB Contemporary approaches that use fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a
   possible target for natural and sexual selection are based on the
   premise that FA is a quantifiable expression of developmental
   instability (DI) that is inherited. Previous work with Drosophila
   buzzatii found that male mating success was correlated positively to
   body size (wing length) and negatively to FA, but these relationships
   seem to be environmentally induced. Heritability of FA was low and not
   significantly different from zero, but statistical power was also
   estimated to be very low and, hence, no conclusive evidence could be
   obtained. A large half-sib mating design is used here to examine the
   relationships of different aspects of development for wing size.
   Consistently with previous findings, I found high heritabilities for
   wing length (WL) and wing width (WW), and positive correlations between
   both traits. Heritabilities of FA (FA(WL), FA(WW)) were low (0.037) but
   significantly different from zero, and the genetic correlation between
   FA(WL) and FA(WW) was estimated as -1 because the absolute value for the
   genetic covariance was similar in magnitude or even larger than the
   estimated genetic variances of both traits. This suggests that these two
   traits should be considered to be the same character. The between-trait
   phenotypic correlation in FA, which reduces to the repeatability in this
   situation, was positive and statistically significant thus rendering an
   estimate of heritability for DI in D. buzzatii of h(DI)(2) approximate
   to 0.41. Nevertheless, the fact that left/right wing sizes were found to
   be determined by the same set of genes is difficult to reconcile with
   the presence of special genetic mechanisms that stabilize left/right
   development in this species. A qualitatively different pattern for
   asymmetry was observed when the nonlinear composite character wing area
   (WA approximate to WL x WW) was used, and h(FAWA)(2) = -0.10. Although
   the results could be made compatible with the existence of a diallelic
   locus with antagonistic pleiotropic effects on FA(WL) and FA(WW) that
   combine multiplicatively to produce overdominance for FA(WA), the
   available evidence is extremely weak at best. Finally, a test to the
   null hypothesis of a nongenetic basis of FA, particularly relevant to
   those situations when directional asymmetry may be heritable, is
   suggested.

   information system (GIS) tools. Predictors were measured from a digital
   elevation model (DEM) and stream layers. We evaluated the accuracy of
   GIS measures of reach slope through a comparison with field measures.
   Resource selection function models were used to explain presence-absence
   of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), rainbow trout, (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss), nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and all fishes.
   Our models were extrapolated based oil low, medium, and high levels of
   probability to produce reach-scale maps across 12 000 km(2). We
   attempted to improve models by adding land-use variables; however, the
   terrain best suited to road building and harvest also contained the
   habitat selected by rainbow trout, whereas bull trout generally selected
   terrain too steep for land use. These confounding factors emphasize the
   need for process-based investigations in addition to correlative
   approaches to identify habitat requirements. This automated method
   provides a rapid evaluation of fish habitat across remote areas useful
   for salmonid conservation and research planning.

AB Sole (Solea solea), telemetered in an enclosure using an acoustic
   positioning system, changed their swimming trajectories and orientation
   behaviour as a function of wind strength and direction. Monitoring of
   the spatial variation in both wind-generated currents and noise spectra
   in the enclosure indicates that these behavioural changes correspond to
   patterns in the spatial distribution of noise and to sound intensity.
   Thus, our observations indicate that sole perceives and reacts to
   horizontal variability in ambient noise levels. Such behaviour may be
   important in determining movements of fish populations at sea during
   poor weather conditions.

AB To test the hypothesis that the sex ratio of the copepod Acartia tonsa
   is biased at birth, adult sex ratios of the offspring of families (21
   families in 2011 and 72 in 2013) produced by field-caught females were
   determined in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Sex ratios at
   birth were estimated from the adult sex ratio, and after applying a
   correction in which all dead/missing individuals were counted as the
   rarer sex (males). Before correction the overall population sex ratio
   was female biased during both years, with over 42% of mothers producing
   clutches that were significantly different from unity. After correction,
   25% (2013) to 33% (2011) of mothers still produced significantly biased
   sex ratios. The ratio of deaths of males to females had to be 1.75 to 1
   (2011) and 7.25 to 1 (2013) for sex ratios not to be biased at birth.
   There was no evidence of sex reversal in any individual from juvenile
   (C4 stage) to adult, implying that juvenile sex ratios were also
   significantly biased. Hence, neither sex reversal nor differential
   mortality of the sexes is a likely explanation for the observed skewed
   sex ratios. The sex ratios at birth varied widely from the expectation
   from Mendelian inheritance of sex chromosomes, suggesting that another
   mechanism is responsible for skewed sex ratios at birth. Since the
   majority of families with biased sex ratios at birth were female
   dominated as adults, biased sex ratio at birth may contribute to the
   skewed sex ratio of adults observed in the field.

AB Adaptation to warming climates could counteract the effects of global
   warming. Thus, understanding how species cope with contrasting climates
   may inform us about their potential for thermal adaptation and which
   processes may hamper that ability (e.g. evolutionary trade-offs,
   phenology or behavioural thermoregulation). In addition to temperature,
   time constraints may also exert important selective pressures. Here, we
   compare the thermal sensitivity of locomotion of metamorphic and adult
   European common frogs (Rana temporaria) originating from populations
   along an elevational gradient. We employed the template mode of
   variation (TMV) analysis to decompose the thermal sensitivity of
   locomotion and explore the existence of trade-offs ('hotter is better'
   and 'specialist-generalist') and the degree of local adaptation. To that
   end, we studied the relationship between TMV parameters and local
   environmental conditions. Further, we compared preferred temperatures to
   assess whether behavioural thermoregulation could dampen the effects of
   thermal variation, reducing the intensity of selection and limiting
   thermal adaptation (i.e. 'Bogert effect'). We suggest that behavioural
   thermoregulation has promoted the conservatism of thermal sensitivity in
   R. temporaria. Yet, we observed a trend towards narrower thermal niches
   shifted towards warmer temperature in populations with severe temporal
   constraints, conforming to the 'generalist-specialist' trade-off.
   Apparently, this enables time-constrained populations - especially in
   the case of metamorphs - to effectively exploit resources during the
   warmest periods. The limited potential of R. temporaria for thermal
   adaptation suggests that forecasts of global warming should incorporate
   thermoregulation and explore its potential to buffer species from rising
   temperatures.

AB Clinal variation in life histories can be genetically based, resulting
   from selection imposed by different environments, or it may be due to
   the differential expression of phenotypically plastic traits. We
   examined the dine in voltinism in the egg-diapausing cricket
   Allonemobius socius, with populations spanning the switch from a
   univoltine to a bivoltine phenology. A common garden experiment was
   employed, using environments that mimicked photoperiod and temperature
   conditions found in the field. There were only small differences in
   development time among populations, and the difference in phenology
   observed in the field is likely due to clinal variation in the length of
   the growing season. We found large genetically-based differences in the
   reaction norm for egg diapause that were further magnified by
   environmental cues. The synergism of genetic and environmental effects
   was an example of cogradient selection. In the zone of transition
   between phenologies, voltinism appeared to be a conditional strategy,
   rather than a genetic polymorphism. First-generation females from this
   area can lay either direct-developing or diapause eggs depending on the
   likelihood that a second generation will have sufficient time to
   develop. For this species, the dine in voltinism is the result of a
   combination of environmental effects on development, and genetic and
   environmental influences on egg diapause propensity.

   respectively. The congener P. acuspes only occurred in low numbers

   distribution revealed a 1-year life cycle with copepodids CIII, CIV, and

AB The spontaneous translocation of the short arm of chromosome 1 of rye
   (1RS) in bread wheat is associated with higher root biomass and grain
   yield. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of QTL for different
   root morphological traits on the 1RS arm in bread wheat. This study was
   conducted to address two questions in wheat root genetics. First, does
   the presence of the 1RS arm in bread wheat affect its root anatomy?
   Second, how does root morphology and anatomy of bread wheat respond to
   different dosages of 1RS? Near-isogenic plants with a different number
   (0 to 4 dosages) of 1RS translocations were studied for root morphology
   and anatomy. The F(1) hybrid, with single doses of the 1RS and 1AS arms,
   showed heterosis for root and shoot biomass. In other genotypes, with 0,
   2, or 4 doses of 1RS, root biomass was incremental with the increase in
   the dosage of 1RS in bread wheat. This study also provided evidence of
   the presence of gene(s) influencing root xylem vessel number, size, and
   distribution in bread wheat. It was found that root vasculature follows
   a specific developmental pattern along the length of the tap root and
   1RS dosage tends to affect the transitions differentially in different
   positions. This study indicated that the inherent differences in root
   morphology and anatomy of different 1RS lines may be advantageous
   compared to normal bread wheat to survive under stress conditions.

AB Plant-generated volatiles constitute a sensitive signal of stress
   response, but quantitative relationships between the stress severity and
   volatile emissions have been demonstrated only for a few stresses. Among
   important stresses in the field, chilling and frost stress in spring and
   heat stress mid-season can significantly curb productivity. We studied
   the effects of cold and heat shock treatments on leaf photosynthesis and
   the emission of the volatile products of the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX,
   also called green leaf volatiles) and mono- and sesquiterpene emissions
   in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Mato) to gain quantitative insights
   into temperature stress-elicited volatile emissions. Both cold and heat
   stress treatments ranged from mild, which only weakly affected foliage
   photosynthesis, to severe, which almost completely inhibited
   photosynthesis. Under non-stressed conditions, LOX emissions were close
   to the detection limit, and terpene emissions were low. Both cold and
   heat stress led to enhancement of LOX emissions according to a
   switch-type response with essentially no emissions under mild stress and
   major emissions under severe stress. The emissions of mono- and
   sesquiterpenes increased gradually with the severity of stress, but cold
   stress resulted in higher sesquiterpene emissions at any given
   monoterpene emission level. We suggest that the quantitative
   relationships between the stress strength and emissions observed in this
   study provide an important means to characterize the severity of cold
   and heat stresses. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Dandelion is a cosmopolitan weed of economic and environmental
   significance because of its negative effects on crop yield and the large
   amount of herbicides used for its control in agricultural, residential,
   and recreational areas in North America. Asexual dandelion plants, which
   are apomictic and produce genetically identical seeds, provide a great
   experimental model for biological studies, such as examination of its
   reproductive responses to global environmental changes. In a growth
   chamber experiment, we investigated how elevated CO2 affected
   reproduction and seed dispersal properties in dandelion. Dandelion
   plants were grown at ambient (370 mu mol mot(-1)) or elevated (730 mu
   mol mot(-1)) CO2 until reproductive maturity. Results showed that
   dandelion plants examined in our study produced 83% more inflorescences
   and 32% more achenes, i.e., single-seed fruits, per plant at elevated
   than at ambient CO2. Seeds from elevated CO2-grown plants were
   significantly heavier and had a higher germination percentage, leading
   to larger seedlings and earlier establishment in the subsequent
   generation. Furthermore, achenes from plants grown at elevated CO2 had
   characteristics, such as higher stalks at seed maturity, longer beaks,
   and larger pappi, which would increase the distance of seed dispersal by
   wind. In addition to these elevated CO2-induced changes in reproductive
   properties, dandelion has a number of inherent characteristics, e.g.,
   high competitiveness and adaptations to disturbance, that would increase
   its vegetative and reproductive success in a higher CO2 environment.
   Consequently, dandelion can potentially become more widespread and
   noxious as atmospheric CO2 continues to rise because of human
   activities.

AB Climate change has altered life history events in many plant species;
   however, little is known about genetic variation underlying seasonal
   thermal response. In this study, we simulated current and three future
   warming climates and measured flowering time across a globally diverse
   set of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We found that increased diurnal
   and seasonal temperature (1 degrees-3 degrees) decreased flowering time
   in two fall cohorts. The early fall cohort was unique in that both rapid
   cycling and overwintering life history strategies were revealed; the
   proportion of rapid cycling plants increased by 3-7% for each 1 degrees
   temperature increase. We performed genome-wide association studies
   (GWAS) to identify the underlying genetic basis of thermal sensitivity.
   GWAS identified five main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL)

AB In poplars (Populus), bspA encodes a 32-kD bark storage protein that
   accumulates in the inner bark of plants exposed to either short-day (SD)
   photoperiods or elevated levels of nitrogen. In this study, poplars
   transformed with a chimeric gene consisting of the bspA promoter fused
   to beta -glucuronidase (uidA) were used to investigate the
   transcriptional regulation of the bspA promoter. Photoperiodic
   activation of the bspA promoter was shown to involve perception by
   phytochrome and likely involves both a low fluence response and a
   parallel very low fluence response pathway. Activity of the bspA
   promoter was also-influenced by shoot growth. High levels of bspA
   expression usually occur in the bark of plants during SD but not long
   day or SD with a night break. When growth was inhibited under growth
   permissive photoperiods (SD with night break) levels of bark beta
   -glucuronidase (GUS) activity increased. Stimulating shoot growth in
   plants treated with SD inhibited SD-induced increases in bark GUS
   activity. Because changes in photoperiod and growth also alter carbon
   and nitrogen partitioning, the role of carbon and nitrogen metabolites
   in modulating the activity of the bspA promoter were investigated by
   treating excised stems with amino acids or NH4NO3 with or without
   sucrose. Treatment with either glutamine or NH4NO3 resulted in increased
   stem GUS activity. The addition of sucrose with either glutamine or
   NH4NO3 resulted in synergistic induction of GUS, whereas sucrose alone
   had no effect. Glutamine plus sucrose induction of GUS activity was
   inhibited by EGTA, okadaic acid, or K-252A. Inhibition by EGTA was
   partially relieved by the addition of Ca2+. The Ca2+ ionophore,
   ionomycin, also induced GUS activity in excised shoots. These results
   indicate that transcriptional activation of bspA is complex. It is
   likely that SD activation of bspA involves perception by phytochrome
   coupled to changes in growth. These growth changes may then alter carbon
   and nitrogen partitioning that somehow signals bspA induction by a yet
   undefined mechanism that involves carbon and nitrogen metabolites, Ca2+,
   and protein phosphorylation/dephosyhorylation.

AB Species' responses to environmental changes such as global warming are
   affected not only by trends in mean conditions, but also by natural and
   human-induced environmental fluctuations. Methods are needed to predict
   how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary
   processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve
   biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and
   empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in
   environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects
   population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent
   claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance
   can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates.
   Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects
   of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental
   variance remains constant, omitting it from population models
   compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in
   mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of
   environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses
   to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic
   history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global
   change under future environmental variability.

AB Dormancy strategies, including diapause and quiescence, enable insects
   to evade adverse conditions and ensure seasonally appropriate life
   stages. A mechanistic understanding of a species' dormancy is necessary
   to predict population response in a changing climate. Climate change is
   influencing distribution patterns and population success of many
   species, including Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae: Scolytinae), the most important mortality agent of pines
   in western North America. Diapause is considered absent in D.
   ponderosae, and quiescence in the final larval stage prior to pupation
   (i.e., prepupal) is considered the main dormancy strategy. We evaluated
   if a facultative diapause in the prepupal stage, rather than a pupation
   threshold similar to 15 degrees C (i.e., quiescence), could describe
   pupation patterns in two latitudinally separated D. ponderosae
   populations in the western United States. We hypothesized that if
   pupation occurs at lower temperatures than previously described, and if
   significant prepupal developmental delays occur, diapause is a likely
   physiological mechanism. Although there was considerable variation
   within and between populations, pupation occurred below the previously
   established threshold suggesting a prepupal facultative diapause that is
   induced when late instars experience cool temperatures. Individuals that
   pupated at temperatures below 15 degrees C also had developmental
   delays, relative to development at warmer temperatures, consistent with
   diapause development. Pupation patterns differed between populations
   wherein diapause was induced at cooler temperatures and diapause
   development was shorter in southern compared with northern D.
   ponderosae. Recognition of a facultative diapause that varies among and
   between populations is critical for making predictions about future
   population response and range expansion in a changing climate.

AB Dietary starches can be classified into 3 major fractions according to
   in vitro digestibility as rapidly digestible (RDS), slowly digestible
   (SDS), and resistant starch (RS). Literature indicates that SDS and/or
   RS have significant implications on human health, particularly glucose
   metabolism, diabetes management, colon cancer prevention, mental
   performance, and satiety. In this study, the nutritionally important
   starch fractions (RDS, SDS, and RS) in cooked rice were assayed in
   vitro, making use of 16 cultivars grown in 5 southern U. S. rice growing
   locations (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas). RDS,
   SDS, and RS were 52.4% to 69.4%, 10.3% to 26.6%, and 1.2% to 9.0%,
   respectively, of cooked rice dry weight. Cultivar, location, and
   cultivar-by-location interaction contributed to the variations in RDS,
   SDS, and RS contents. Means pooled across locations indicated that SDS
   was higher for the Louisiana samples than those from Texas, whereas RS
   was higher for the Texas samples than those from Arkansas, Louisiana,
   and Mississippi. Some cultivars were identified to possess high levels
   of RS (for example, Bowman and Rondo) or SDS (for example, Dixiebelle
   and Tesanai-2) and were also stable across growing locations. Apparent
   amylose content correlated positively with RS (n = 80, r = 0.54, P <=
   0.001), negatively with RDS (n = 80, r = -0.29, P <= 0.05), and
   insignificantly with SDS (n = 80, r = 0.21, P > 0.05). RS and SDS were
   not collinear (n = 80, r = -0.18, P > 0.05); it does not follow that a
   cultivar high in RS will also be high in SDS, and vice versa. The
   observed differences in RDS, SDS, and RS among the samples are
   indicative of wide genetic diversity in rice.

AB Many studies have investigated the consequences of individual variation
   in resting metabolic rate at thermoneutrality (RMRt) on reproductive
   performance. Despite strong theoretical reasons for expecting such an
   association, results have generally been disappointing. A fundamental
   assumption of these studies is that RMRt is a repeatable trait. We
   examined repeatability of RMRt in female MF1 mice over short (15 days
   apart; N=238) and long intervals (110 days apart; N=33). In the
   long-term experiment, after the first RMRt measurement, females were
   separated in two groups: the first was kept virgin (N=16); the second
   was allowed to breed (N=17) and measured 15 days after they had weaned
   their pups. We also examined the association between RMRt and
   reproduction. We used Pearson's correlation (r) and intraclass
   correlation coefficients (rho) to estimate repeatability. There was a
   strong effect of body mass on RMRt for all measurements. Over the short
   interval, repeatability was significant for body mass (r=0.86;
   rho=0.86), RMRt (r=0.68; rho=0.68,) and residual-RMRt (r=0.58;
   rho=0.58). Over long intervals, repeatability of residual-RMRt was high
   in virgin females (r=0.59; rho=0.60), but not in the breeders (r=0.38;
   rho=0.39); body mass was repeatable only for non-breeders measured by r
   (r=0.55). There was no significant correlation between RMRt or
   residual-RMRt and litter size or litter mass. In conclusion, RMRt and
   residual-RMRt are highly repeatable traits in virgin MF1 female mice.
   The lack of association between nonreproductive RMRt and reproductive
   performance in MF1 mice does not come about because of its poor
   repeatability.

AB According to the concept of the "minimal boundary curve for endothermy",
   mammals and birds with a basal metabolic rate (BMR) that falls below the
   curve are obligate heterotherms and must enter torpor. We examined the
   reliability of the boundary curve (on a double log plot transformed to a
   line) for predicting torpor as a function of body mass and BMR for birds
   and several groups of mammals. The boundary line correctly predicted
   heterothermy in 87.5% of marsupials (n = 64), 94% of bats (n = 85) and
   82.3% of rodents (n = 157). Our analysis shows that the boundary line is
   not a reliable predictor for use of torpor. A discriminate analysis
   using body mass and BMR had a similar predictive power as the boundary
   line. However, there are sufficient exceptions to both methods of
   analysis to suggest that the relationship between body mass, BMR and
   heterothermy is not a causal one. Some homeothermic birds (e.g.
   silvereyes) and rodents (e.g. hopping mice) fall below the boundary
   line, and there are many examples of heterothermic species that fall
   above the boundary line. For marsupials and bats, but not for rodents,
   there was a highly significant phylogenetic pattern for heterothermy,
   suggesting that taxonomic affiliation is the biggest determinant of
   heterothermy for these mammalian groups. For rodents, heterothermic
   species had lower BMRs than homeothermic species. Low BMR and use of
   torpor both contribute to reducing energy expenditure and both
   physiological traits appear to be a response to the same selective
   pressure of fluctuating food supply, increasing fitness in endothermic
   species that are constrained by limited energy availability. Both the
   minimal boundary line and discriminate analysis were of little value for
   predicting the use of daily torpor or hibernation in heterotherms,
   presumably as both daily torpor and hibernation are precisely controlled
   processes, not an inability to thermoregulate.

AB Muggelsee, a shallow eutrophic lake (Berlin, Germany), has been subject
   to global warming and concurrent reductions of anthropogenic nutrient
   loading during the past decades. Here, we focus on the recent increase
   in abundance of Dreissena polymorpha larvae. We aimed at ascertaining
   whether the change in abundance of larvae was driven by changes in
   climate, especially by climate warming, and/or by the concurrent changes
   in trophic state of the lake. Both the numbers of small, newly developed
   larvae and their lengths have increased in recent years, suggesting that
   conditions for overall reproductive success have improved. The timing of
   the increase in abundance of larvae was matched by changes in nutrient
   loading and phytoplankton biomass, induced by a reduced inflow of
   nutrients into the lake. Besides a correlation between the first
   appearance of larvae each year and the timing of the requisite
   temperature for first spawning (12 degrees C), no relationship between
   changes in water temperature and abundance, length and survival rates of
   larvae was found. However, a sudden drop in abundance of larvae in 2003
   may be primarily attributed to low dissolved oxygen conditions during an
   unusually long period of stratification, induced by anomalous
   meteorological conditions. The increase in length and survival rates of
   larvae was most likely due to changes in food composition, which
   followed the decrease in nutrient availability, and to changes in the
   occurrence of planktivorous fish. The results suggest that the first
   appearance of larvae per year and the decline in abundance of larvae in
   2003 were driven by climatic influences, while the overall increase in
   abundance and length of D. polymorpha larvae in Muggelsee was more
   likely caused by changes in the trophic state of the lake rather than by
   climate warming.

AB 1. Ontogenetic changes during the life cycle of aquatic insects are
   important not only in life-history studies but also in evaluating
   food-web structure. They require information on the growth and number of
   larval instars but such information is lacking for many species,
   including Plecoptera. Therefore, the chief objectives of the present
   study were to determine inter- and intra-specific differences in the
   number of larval instars in British populations of 24 species of
   stoneflies, to test Dyar's hypothesis that growth followed a geometric
   progression, and to synthesise this information with previously
   published values for four British species.
   2. Larvae were reared at constant temperatures in the laboratory from
   eggs from 63 populations (one to six populations per species). First
   instars from each population were divided into three batches and each
   batch was reared at one of three constant temperatures. For each
   species, the rearing temperature and source population had no
   significant effect on the mean size of each larval instar.
   3. The relationship between the geometric mean length of each instar and
   instar number was well described by an exponential equation (P < 0.001,
   r(2) > 0.9 for all species), thus supporting Dyar's hypothesis. Only one
   species, Brachyptera risi, had the same number of instars for males and
   females (12-13). For the other 15 herbivorous species and the four
   smaller carnivorous ones, the number of instars was higher for females
   than males (range 11-16 for males, 12-17 for females). The larger size
   of the females was due to their additional instars, not a sex difference
   in growth rates. In contrast, there was a clear growth separation of the
   sexes after the 9th or 10th instar for the four largest carnivores. The
   number of larval instars was highest for these four species (range 16-19
   for males, 18-23 for females), and females were much larger than males.
   4. A multiple regression equation with data from the present and
   previous studies (n = 27) showed that variability in the mean length of
   the first instar and the maximum number of larval instars for each
   species accounted for 88% and 91% of the variability in the mean length
   of the final instar for males and females, respectively.
   5. Values for Plecoptera in other countries were in general agreement
   with those in the present study, especially in the same families. Two
   old, but widely quoted, high values are doubtful. The present study and
   four previous ones provide a sound basis for ontogenetic studies on 28
   species of Plecoptera and their role in aquatic ecosystems.

AB The present study determined whether the motor process of handwriting is
   influenced by a circadian rhythm during writing tasks of high everyday
   relevance and analyzed the relationship to the circadian rhythm of grip
   strength. Ten healthy young male subjects underwent a 40h
   sleep-deprivation protocol under constant routine conditions. Starting
   at 09:00h, subjects performed three handwriting tasks of increasing
   perceptual-motor complexity (writing a sentence, writing one's
   signature, and copying a text for 3min) and assessed grip strength of
   both hands every 3h. Handwriting performance was analyzed by writing
   speed, writing fluency, script size, break times, and pen pressure. The
   handwriting tasks revealed a coincident circadian rhythm for the
   frequency of handwriting as a measure of movement speed, with slowest
   writing speed at 03:16h. A weak effect of task complexity was evident
   for the non-writing episodes: while copying a text, break times were
   influenced by a circadian rhythm, whereas during sentence writing, the
   non-writing episodes remained constant. The circadian rhythm of grip
   strength paralleled the time course of motivation ratings, with least
   motivation and weakest grip strength around 06:00h concurrently for both
   hands. The rate of force production also displayed circadian rhythmicity
   and sharply decreased with the onset of melatonin secretion. Neither
   grip strength nor the kinematics of handwriting was influenced by sleep
   deprivation; only the level of the force rate was decreased the second
   day. The results show a clear circadian rhythm in the speed of
   handwriting and grip strength.

   degrees C, some 10-13 degrees C below those tolerated by southern
   conspecifics, and endured a 2-month bout of freezing at -4 degrees C.
   The profound freeze tolerance is presumably due to their high levels of
   organic osmolytes and bound water, which limits ice formation. Adaptive
   responses to freezing (-2.5 degrees C for 48 h) and subsequent thawing
   (4 degrees C) included synthesis of the cryoprotectants urea and
   glucose, and dehydration of certain tissues. Alaskan frogs differed from
   Ohioan frogs in retaining a substantial reserve capacity for glucose
   synthesis, accumulating high levels of cryoprotectants in brain tissue,
   and remaining hyperglycemic long after thawing. The northern phenotype
   also incurred less stress during freezing/thawing, as indicated by
   limited cryohemolysis and lactate accumulation. Post-glacial
   colonization of high latitudes by R. sylvatica required a substantial
   increase in freeze tolerance that was at least partly achieved by
   enhancing their cryoprotectant system.

AB We evaluated the error of estimate brought while: (1) undertaking some
   classical hypotheses in modeling plant growth in a dynamic way, (2)
   using imprecise measurements of physiological characteristics of the
   plant or in the environmental data, and (3) not taking into account
   plant acclimation ability. We synthesised classical models based on a
   carbon mass-balance approach and run for populations of Ranunculus
   peltatus, a spreading macrophyte in rivers of Northeastern France.
   Simulations were performed for five contrasting combinations of
   environmental parameters. Among the 54 models tested, we demonstrate
   highly variable results in terms of maximum biomass reached and plant
   temporal biomass production. The way plant architecture was approximated
   contributed significantly to biomass results. From the simulations, we
   selected a family of models using simple decision rules. Using these
   models, we underlined that: (1) light availability and to a lesser
   extent, temperature and current velocity were key main environmental
   factors for plant growth and should be measured with accuracy; (2) the
   optimum temperature for photosynthesis and the maximum activities for
   all physiological processes were the most sensitive constants entering
   the model; (3) taking into account plant plasticity (i.e. their
   capabilities to modify their physiological and morphological
   characteristics to adapt to lack of resources or seasonal environmental
   changes) greatly modifies biomass production, especially when adapting
   to nutrient stress or to seasonal temperature variation. All these
   results may contribute significantly to the improvement of existing
   dynamic models and especially of the validation process. (c) 2006

AB Varied egg incubation temperatures can result in immediate effects on
   the phenotype of reptiles, and also latent effects that can augment or
   contradict effects evident at egg hatching. I examined the effects of
   incubation temperature on embryonic development, hatching morphology,
   and subsequent growth in multiple populations of the lizard Anolis
   carolinensis. Eggs from wild-caught females in four populations were
   incubated at up to three temperatures, 23.5, 27, and 30 degrees C.
   Measures of body size were collected immediately after hatching and
   weekly thereafter, while juveniles were maintained in a common
   laboratory environment for 8 weeks. Cooler incubation temperatures
   resulted in longer incubation periods but did not affect conversion of
   egg mass to hatchling mass. Incubation temperature did not affect
   hatchling mass or snout vent length (SVL), but did affect subsequent
   growth in both mass and SVL, which varied by population. Cooler
   incubation temperatures generally resulted in greater overall growth
   over 8 weeks of housing all juveniles in a common environment. In A.
   carolinensis, egg incubation temperature had latent effects on juvenile
   growth despite the absence of any detected immediate effects on
   hatchling phenotype. Therefore, the total impact and evolutionary
   importance of developmental environment should not be assessed or
   assumed based solely on the phenotype of reptiles at birth or hatching.

AB Aim To study densities of eight groups of resident forest bird
   populations across Europe to examine their association with abiotic
   (temperature, precipitation) factors.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Densities of residents (and migrant birds, which were used as a
   control group) were extracted from published breeding bird censuses. For
   each census location we obtained geographical co-ordinates (latitude and
   longitude), temperature and precipitation variables describing both
   breeding and non-breeding seasons. Resident densities were first
   examined separately in relation to co-ordinates and principal component
   axes, which were extracted from temperature and precipitation variables.
   The relative impact of each explaining factor (co-ordinates and
   principal component axis) on resident densities was checked by using
   residual examination and partial correlation.
   Results Densities of resident birds were in general negatively
   correlated with both latitude and longitude and temperature and
   precipitation factors, but latitude and temperature proved to be the
   strongest individual factors along which resident densities varied. The
   higher the latitude or the lower the temperatures, the lower were the
   densities of most resident birds. Partial correlation analysis suggested
   that of those two factors, latitude was the dominant one. Both the
   density of resident and migrant birds decreased towards the north, but
   the decrease of residents was steeper, and in the north they comprised
   only a small fraction of breeding bird numbers, whereas further south
   they commonly comprise half of the breeding bird numbers.
   Main conclusions The best explanatory factor for resident densities was
   latitude. For this reason, it was difficult to separate the relative
   effect of each individual factor, because latitude partly describes all
   the original variables (temperature and precipitation). The results
   suggested that precipitation was of less importance and that the
   interplay between latitude and ambient temperatures was not the sole
   factor behind the strong effect of latitude. We suggest that the coupled
   effect of harshening climate and decreasing amount of available energy
   with increasing latitude is limiting the population sizes of resident
   birds. We also propose that the effect of those factors is most apparent
   in northern Fennoscandia, where resident densities are suggested to be
   lower than would be expected on the basis of summer time carrying
   capacity.

AB Diatom and chrysophyte cyst-based reconstructions of the dates of spring
   and autumn lake-mixing enabled us to estimate spring (STanom) and autumn
   (AT(anom)) temperature anomalies as well as ice-cover of the last ca.
   4,000 years in a lake sediment core (Oberer Landschitzsee, 2,076 m
   a.s.l.) from the southern slopes of the Austrian Central Alps. The two
   independently inferred temperature anomalies were significantly
   correlated. On average, spring and autumn temperatures were lower during
   the two millennia B.C than during 0-1,300 A.D. Marked spring and autumn
   temperature minima occurred at about 1,300 and 600 B.C. At about 1,300
   A.D, STanom declined again. Spring-temperature anomalies during Roman
   and Medieval times equaled or slightly exceeded the modern values and
   paralleled tree-line and glacier fluctuations. The de-coupling of autumn
   and spring climates, which began during the Medieval period, might
   indicate changes in major circulation modes. It was assumed that the
   North-Atlantic influence, triggering winter-rain climate in the Northern
   Mediterranean, became weaker during Medieval times, resulting in a trend
   towards warmer autumns and overall more continental climate conditions
   in the study area. Four pulses of land use, inferred from indicator
   pollen, occurred during (1) the Early to Late Bronze, (2) the transition
   from Late Bronze to Early Iron Age (Hallstatt), (3) Late Iron Age (La
   Tene, Celtic time) to Roman times, and (4) during high to late Medieval
   times. Climate seemed to be an important, though complex, trigger of
   Alpine land use.

AB We measured annual shell growth rates of a 374-year-old (radiometrically
   confirmed) bivalve mollusk specimen of Arctica islandica (Linnaeus).
   This bivalve represents the oldest ever reported individual animal. In
   addition, we analyzed 1051 individual powder samples from ontogenetic
   years two to 40 (=80% of the entire shell height) for isotope analyses.
   Oxygen and carbon isotopes exhibit clear intra-annual cycles. The
   highest measured carbon isotope values (on average+2.73 parts per
   thousand) occurred during summer, i.e., during maximum primary
   productivity. The delta O-18(aragonite)-derived temperature time-series
   cover the period of AD 1496-1533. Temperatures calculated from oxygen
   isotopes ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 degrees C and exhibit a mean value of
   6.2 degrees C. The latter coincides well with the 1854-2003 mean value
   of 6.81 degrees C for sea-surface temperature between February and
   September (=growing season of A. islandica). Neither oxygen nor carbon
   isotopes exhibit age-related, unidirectional trends. However, delta
   C-13(aragonite) and delta O-18(aragonite) values fluctuated at decadal
   periods of four, six and eight to nine years (NAO-type periods) as well
   as 12-14 years which may represent teleconnections to cycles in the
   tropical Atlantic. Annual shell growth is positively correlated to
   intra-annual delta O-18(aragonite) minima, i.e., warm summer
   temperatures (R-2=0.34), and to intra-annual delta C-13(aragonite)
   minima (higher food supply; R-2=0.42). Using a linear multiregression
   model, 65% of the variation in annual shell growth can be explained by
   summer temperature and food supply. The formation of extremely narrow
   annual increments coincides with major volcanic eruptions (e.g., Tambora
   1815). A period of extremely variable growth occurred during the
   culmination of the Little Ice Age in Iceland between ca. AD 1550 and
   1620. Shell growth during AD 1765-1780, however, was characterized by
   very little year-to-year variability, probably as the result of
   extremely mild climate near the end of the Little Ice Age. This study
   demonstrates that shells of A. islandica provide subseasonal to
   multidecadal, precisely dated multi-proxies of environmental variables
   from marine, mid to high latitudes. Such data can be used to validate
   and complement climate models and further assess human impact on climate
   and ecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well-known that the Holocene exhibits a millennial-scale climate
   variability. However, its periodicity, spatio-temporal patterns and
   underlying processes are not fully deciphered yet. Here we focus on the
   central and western Mediterranean. We show that recurrent forest
   declines from the Gulf of Gaeta (central Tyrrhenian Sea) reveal a
   1860-yr periodicity, consistent with a ca. 1800-yr climate fluctuation
   induced by large-scale changes in climate modes, linked to solar
   activity and/or AMOC intensity. We show that recurrent forest declines
   and dry events are also recorded in several pollen and
   palaeohydrological proxy-records in the south-central Mediterranean. We
   found coeval events also in several palaeohydrological records from the
   south-western Mediterranean, which however show generally wet climate
   conditions, indicating a spatio-temporal hydrological pattern opposite
   to the south-central Mediterranean and suggesting that different
   expressions of climate modes occurred in the two regions at the same
   time. We propose that these opposite hydroclimate regimes point to a
   complex interplay of the prevailing or predominant phases of NAO-like
   circulation, East Atlantic pattern, and extension and location of the
   North African anticyclone. At a larger geographical scale, displacements
   of the ITCZ, modulated by solar activity and/or AMOC intensity, may have
   also indirectly influenced the observed pattern.

AB Temporal variability in species distribution remains a major source of
   uncertainty in managing protected marine species, particularly in
   ecosystems with significant seasonal or inter-annual variation, such as
   the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). Spatially explicit species
   habitat models have become valuable tools for decision makers assisting
   in the development and implementation of measures to reduce adverse
   impacts (e.g. from fishery bycatch, ship strikes, anthropogenic sound),
   but such models are often not available for all seasons of interest.
   Broad-scale migratory patterns of many of the large whale species are
   well known, while seasonal distribution shifts of small cetaceans are
   typically less well understood. Within the CCE, species habitat models
   have been developed based on 6 summer-fall surveys conducted during 1991
   to 2008. We evaluated whether the between-year oceanographic variability
   can inform species predictions during winter spring periods. Generalized
   additive models were developed to predict abundance of 4 cetacean
   species/genera known to have year-round occurrence in the CCE: common
   dolphins Delphinus spp., Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus
   obliguidens, northern right whale dolphin Lissodelphis borealis, and
   Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli. Predictor variables included a
   combination of temporally dynamic, remotely sensed environmental
   variables and geographically fixed variables. Across-season predictive
   ability was evaluated relative to aerial surveys conducted in winter
   spring 1991 to 1992, using observed:predicted density ratios,
   non-parametric Spearman rank correlation tests, and visual inspection of
   predicted and observed distributions by species. Seasonal geographic
   patterns of species density were captured effectively for most species,
   although some model limitations were evident, particularly when the
   original summer-fall data did not adequately capture winter-spring
   habitat conditions.

AB Remote sensing products, including aerial imagery, can be used to
   quantify characteristics of watersheds and stream corridors that often
   predict the distribution and abundance of aquatic species. We conducted
   a supervised, object-oriented classification of imagery from the
   National Agricultural Imagery Program to develop a high-resolution (1-m)
   land cover data set with four cover classes, emphasizing accurate
   characterization of woody riparian vegetation along stream corridors in
   northern Nevada and southwestern Idaho. The overall classification
   accuracy was 76%, and producer's accuracy (reflecting false positives)
   and user's accuracy (reflecting false negatives) for the woody
   vegetation class were 84% and 70%, respectively. Using logistic and
   quantile regression models in a model-selection framework, we found
   woody vegetation to be positively associated with the occurrence and
   density of Redband Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri. In addition,
   occurrence probabilities and densities were highest at mean August
   stream temperatures (predicted from a stream temperature model) ranging
   from 13 degrees C to 17 degrees C. When considered together with stream
   temperature, percent woody vegetation typically predicted Redband Trout
   occurrence and density better than most field-measured instream and
   riparian habitat variables in northern Nevada. Our study highlights how
   free high-resolution imagery can be used to characterize woody riparian
   vegetation and Redband Trout habitat across a large and remote desert
   landscape that can be difficult to access for field surveys. It also
   suggests that imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program may
   have wider application in identifying stream habitat restoration
   opportunities, where land and water uses have negatively impacted woody
   riparian vegetation in desert regions of the interior western United
   States.

AB To study the allometric relationship between standard metabolic rate and
   body mass (mass range 16-3627 g) in green iguanas, Iguana iguana (n=32),
   we measured rates of oxygen consumption (V-O2) at 30 degreesC during
   scotophase. The relationship could be described as: V-O2(ml h(-1)) =
   0.47 8W(0.734). The resulting mass exponent was similar to the 3/4 power
   commonly used in interspecific curves (P>0.05), but differed from a
   proposed intraspecific value of 2/3 (P < 0.05). The mass exponents of
   male (n=8) and female (n=11) iguanas did not differ (P>0.05). The mass
   adjusted V-O2 was higher than predicted from generalized squarnate
   curves. The mean mass exponent of intra-individual allometric equations
   of iguanas (n=7) at varying masses during ontogeny did not differ from
   that of the pooled equation, indicating that scaling of 70. is similar
   for both between and within individuals. Thermal acclimation,
   compensatory changes in V-O2 with prolonged exposure to a constant
   temperature, was not observed in juvenile iguanas (n=11) between 1 and 5
   weeks of acclimation at 30 degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All

AB The study of energy expenditure between populations of a wide ranging
   ectothermic species may provide an insight into how organisms respond to
   variation in environmental conditions. In this study, the energy
   expenditure of male spotted snow skinks, Niveoscincus ocellatus, living
   at the two extremes of the species' distribution range (warm lowland
   versus cold alpine site) was measured using the doubly labelled water
   method. Males at the cold alpine site expended more energy per gram per
   hour compared to their counterparts living at the warm lowland site.
   Lizards living at high altitude were active at lower temperatures
   compared with those at the low altitude site, which resulted in a longer
   activity time for the highland population. However, the differences in
   energy expenditure cannot be explained only by these differences in
   activity time. We further suggest that at the cold alpine site, lizards
   compensated for the low temperatures by elevating their metabolism which
   subsequently increased their energy expenditure. An elevated metabolic
   rate combined with modified thermoregulatory behaviour is likely an
   important mechanism allowing N. ocellatus to cope with the cold
   environments at high altitude sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   reproduction. We raised adult females and incubated their eggs under
   different thermal conditions that mimicked potential climate warming.
   Female reproduction, embryonic development and hatchling traits were
   monitored to evaluate the reproductive response to warming. Experimental
   warming induced females to lay eggs earlier, but it did not affect the
   developmental stage of embryos at oviposition or the reproductive
   output. The high temperatures experienced by gravid females during
   warming treatments reduced the incubation period and increased embryonic
   mortality. The locomotor performance of hatchlings was not affected by
   the maternal thermal environment, but it was affected by the warming
   treatment during embryonic development. Our results suggest that climate
   warming might have a profound effect on fitness-relevant traits both at
   embryonic and post-embryonic stages in oviparous lizards.

AB Studies of heat shock response show a correlation with local climate,
   although this is more often across altitudinal than latitudinal
   gradients. In the present study, differences in constitutive but not
   inducible components of heat shock response are detected among
   populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia L.
   that exist at the species' latitudinal range limits (Finland and Spain).
   The study demonstrates that macroclimatic differences between these
   sites should cause greater exposure of the Spanish population to higher
   temperatures. Thermal stress treatments are used to estimate differences
   in the expression of four genes potentially relevant for tolerating
   these temperatures. For the analysis, three heat-shock proteins and
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), a glycolysis enzyme
   that also modulates cell growth based on metabolic state, are chosen.
   Two constitutive differences are found between the sites. First, insects
   from Spain have higher levels of Hsp 21.4 than those from Finland
   regardless of thermal stress treatment; this protein is not inducible.
   Second, insects from Finland have higher levels of G3PDH. The two
   remaining Hsps, Hsp20.4 and Hsp90, show dramatic up-regulation at higher
   temperatures, although there are no significant differences between
   insects from the different populations in either constitutive levels or
   inducibility. In nature, differences between the study populations
   likely occur in the expression of all four genes that were studied,
   although these differences would be directly climate-induced in Hsp20.4
   and Hsp90 and constitutive in Hsp21.4 and G3PDH. Inducibility may
   mitigate the need for constitutive variation in traits that adapt
   insects to local climate.

AB We describe changes in the habitat associations and geographic
   distribution of thorny skate during their feeding season in the southern
   Gulf of St Lawrence, based on 32 yr of monitoring by a bottom-trawl
   survey. In the 1990s, geographic range contracted sharply and
   distribution shifted into a narrow band of warm deep waters. These
   changes appeared to reflect altered habitat selection by individual
   skates, rather than local depletion of the skates that had habitually
   occupied the vacated areas or a change in the timing of seasonal
   migrations. Changes in skate distribution coincided with a decline in
   skate biomass and a cooling of bottom waters. The contraction in the
   geographic range of skates appeared to be a density-dependent response,
   more closely linked to the decline in skate abundance than to the change
   in environmental conditions. The cause of the shift in habitat
   associations is less certain. An index of the distribution shift was
   more strongly correlated with skate biomass than with an index of
   temperature conditions, and the change in temperature associations is in
   the direction predicted by density-dependent bioenergetic
   considerations. However, the shift into deeper waters is into a depth
   zone where skate condition is relatively low, contrary to the
   expectation that fish should be concentrated in optimal habitat at low
   population size. On the other hand, while the shift into warm deep
   waters coincided with a cooling of waters at intermediate depths,
   distribution failed to shift back to the earlier pattern as these waters
   warmed in the late 1990s.

AB A broad zone of sympatry between two morphologically and ecologically
   similar blue mussels Mytilus trossulus (Gould) and M. edulis (L.)
   extends from the Canadian Maritimes into the Gulf of Maine. The zone
   boundary and the southern range limit of M. trossulus coincide with the
   position of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC). This current has
   not been recognized as a biogeographic boundary. However, the flow field
   associated with the EMCC essentially divides the eastern and western
   Gulf during the part of year when mussel populations in the eastern
   portion of the Gulf are reproductively active and thus may be a
   hydrodynamic barrier to the westward dispersal of M. trossulus larvae.
   Alternatively, a strong gradient in water temperature associated with
   the EMCC may create a physiological barrier to M. trossulus larvae. We
   examined spatial variation in the abundance of M. trossulus and M.
   edulis along the coast of Maine using two diagnostic DNA-based markers.
   Although we detected M. trossulus in mussel populations in offshore
   locations in central Maine that were directly in the path of the EMCC,
   the abundance of this species declines dramatically at sites beyond the
   influence of this current. Variation in the abundance of adults,
   however, cannot differentiate between the effects of the EMCC on larval
   transport vs physiological tolerance. Thus, we also conducted a
   temperature challenge experiment investigating the species-specific
   variation in larval survival at temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C to
   20 degrees C. We found that larval mortality was generally higher for M.
   trossulus relative to M. edulis larvae when exposed to 20 degrees C
   early during development. These results suggest that differences in
   larval thermal tolerance help to structure the southern range limit for
   M. trossulus in the Gulf of Maine.

   collected in different European countries, in order to compare their
   performance when reared on eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller
   (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as a potential factitious host for
   mass-rearing. The average number of progeny per female, cumulative
   fertility and emergence rate did not differ significantly, whereas
   female longevity and sex ratio significantly differed between the seven
   parasitoid strains. The Danish strain survived the longest (6.05 days)
   and the Dutch strain survived the shortest (2.75 days). Progeny was
   always female-biased with varying proportions (57.7-96.7%). Survival
   rates started to decrease after 3 days for some of the strains studied.
   The mean cohort generation duration (T-c) was 11.40, 10.15, 10.62,
   10.63, 9.28, 9.70 and 11.30 days for the Austrian, Luxemburgian,
   Belgian, French, Dutch, Danish and German strains, respectively.
   Population doubling time (D-t) was 4.50, 7.96, 3.56, 5.30, 5.23, 7.36
   and 3.30 days, respectively. Daily intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and
   finite rate of increase (exp. r(m)) ranged between 0.087 and 0.210 and
   1.091-1.233, respectively. The German strain might be a potential
   candidate for mass rearing and releases against the codling moth, Cydia
   pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), due to its high net
   reproduction rate (R-0=10.65 female), a high intrinsic rate of natural
   increase (r(m)=0.210), a high finite rate of increase (exp. r(m)=1.23),
   and a short population doubling time (D-t=3.3 days). The relevance of
   intra- and interstrain variability as well as the usefulness of
   fertility life tables for pre-introductory research is discussed.

AB A sedimentary sequence spanning Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS 2 in
   core LC07, recovered in the central Mediterranean, has been investigated
   in order to produce a high-resolution paleoceanographic reconstruction.
   The changes in productivity deduced from calcareous plankton relative
   abundances and independently confirmed by the Ba-XS fluctuations are
   linked to the stability of the water column which is mainly controlled
   by the water mass temperature. During glacial intervals, productivity
   was generally enhanced. Oligotrophic and warmer water masses with a
   deepened seasonal thel'Illocline call be inferred for most of MIS5. The
   magnetic properties of the sediment show increased Occurrences of North
   Africa dust in the central Mediterranean during cold phases, likely as a
   consequence of a more efficient erosive process triggered by southward
   displacement of the intertropical convergence zone. Although increases
   in both productivity and Saharan dust occurred during cold periods, the
   atmospheric inputs do not seem to contribute significantly to the
   fertilization of primary producers. A Shannon Index curve has been used
   to tentatively synthesize the variations of calcareous nannofossil
   assemblages through the last 150 kyr. The assemblage diversity sharply
   increased coincident with the transition from the penultimate glacial to
   the last interglacial, subsequently low diversity was gradually reached
   again in the last glacial. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We report on the emergence of Cochlodinium polykrikigides blooms in the
   Peconic Estuary and Shinnecock Bay, NY, USA, during 2002-2006. Blooms
   occurred during late summer when temperatures and salinities ranged from
   20 to 25 degrees C and 22 to 30 ppt, respectively. Bloom patches
   achieved cell densities exceeding 10(5) ml(-1) and chlorophyll a levels
   exceeding 100 mu g l(-1), while background bloom densities were
   typically 10(3)- 10(4) cells ml(-1). Light, scanning electron and
   ultrathin-section transmission electron microscopy suggested that cells
   isolated from blooms displayed characteristics of C. polykrikoides and
   provide the first clear documentation of the fine structure for this
   species. Sequencing of a hypervariable region of the large subunit rDNA
   confirmed this finding, displaying 100% similarity to other North
   American C polykrikoides strains, but a lower similarity to strains from
   Southeast Asia (88-90%). Bioassay experiments demonstrated that 24 h
   exposure to bloom waters (>5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) killed 100% of
   multiple fish species (1-week-old Cyprinodon variegates, adult Fundulus
   majalis, adult Menidia menidia) and 80% of adult Fundulus heteroclitus.
   Microscopic evaluation of the gills of moribund fish revealed epithelial
   proliferation with focal areas of fusion of gill lamellae, suggesting
   impairment of gill function (e.g. respiration, nitrogen excretion, ion
   balance). Lower fish mortality was observed at intermediate C.
   polykrikoides densities (10(3)-10(4) cells ml(-1)), while fish survived
   for 48 h at cell densities below 1 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). The inability
   of frozen and thawed-, or filtered (0.2 mu m)-bloom water to cause fish
   mortality suggested that the thick polysaccharide layer associated with
   cell membranes and/or a toxin principle within this layer may be
   responsible for fish mortality. Juvenile bay scallops (A rgopecten
   irradians) and American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) experienced
   elevated mortality compared to control treatments during a 9-day
   exposure to bloom water (similar to 5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)). Surviving
   scallops exposed to bloom water also experienced significantly reduced
   growth rates. Moribund shellfish displayed hyperplasia, hemorrhaging,
   squarnation, and apoptosis in gill and digestive tissues with gill
   inflammation specifically associated with areas containing C.
   polykrikoides cells. In summary, our results indicate C. polykrikoides
   blooms have become annual events on eastern Long Island and that bloom
   waters are capable of causing rapid mortality in multiple species of
   finfish and shellfish. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elucidating how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms interact to
   produce and maintain biodiversity is a fundamental problem in
   evolutionary ecology. Here, we focus on how physiological evolution
   affects performance and species coexistence along the thermal niche axis
   in replicated radiations of Anolis lizards best known for resource
   partitioning based on morphological divergence. We find repeated
   divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations, and that this
   divergence significantly affects performance within natural thermal
   environments. Morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably
   differ in their thermal physiology, providing evidence that
   physiological divergence facilitates species coexistence within anole
   communities. Despite repeated divergence, phylogenetic comparative
   analyses indicate that physiological traits have evolved more slowly
   than key morphological traits related to the structural niche.
   Phylogenetic analyses also reveal that physiological divergence is
   correlated with divergence in broad- scale habitat climatic features
   commonly used to estimate thermal niche evolution, but that the latter
   incompletely predicts variation in the former. We provide comprehensive
   evidence for repeated adaptive evolution of physiological divergence
   within Anolis adaptive radiations, including the complementary roles of
   physiological and morphological divergence in promoting community-level
   diversity. We recommend greater integration of performance-based traits
   into analyses of climatic niche evolution, as they facilitate a more
   complete understanding of the phenotypic and ecological consequences of
   climatic divergence.

AB Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to
   improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying
   photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass
   accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the
   earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy
   photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (Oryza
   sativa) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters
   that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of
   canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14
   photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice
   population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated
   minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice
   cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components
   responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a
   stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models.
   Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters
   measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate
   under low light (Alow) was highly related to biomass accumulation and
   also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments,
   suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice
   breeding programs. Large variations in Alow among modern rice cultivars
   further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in
   contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence,
   yield potential.

AB Striped marlin is a highly migratory species distributed throughout the
   North Pacific Ocean, which shows considerable variation in spatial
   distribution as a consequence of habitat preference. This species may
   therefore shift its range in response to future changes in the marine
   environment driven by climate change. It is important to understand the
   factors determining the distribution of striped marlin and the influence
   of climate change on these factors, to develop effective fisheries
   management policies given the economic importance of the species and the
   impact of fishing. We examined the spatial patterns and habitat
   preferences of striped marlin using generalized additive models fitted
   to data from longline fisheries. Future distributions were predicted
   using an ensemble analysis, which represents the uncertainty due to
   several global climate models and greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The
   increase in water temperature driven by climate change is predicted to
   lead to a northward displacement of striped marlin in the North Pacific
   Ocean. Use of a simple predictor of water temperature to describe future
   distribution, as in several previous studies, may not be robust, which
   emphasizes that variables other than sea surface temperatures from
   bioclimatic models are needed to understand future changes in the
   distribution of large pelagic species.

   photosynthetic response to C source-sink imbalances, focusing on the
   dynamics of the photosynthetic parameter triose phosphate utilization
   (TPU). Here, rice (Oriza sativa L.) indica cultivar IR64 were grown in
   controlled environment chambers under current ambient CO2 concentration
   until heading, and thereafter two CO2 treatments (400 and 800 mu mol
   mol(-1)) were compared in the presence and absence of a panicle-pruning
   treatment modifying the C sink. At 2 weeks after heading, photosynthetic
   parameters derived from CO2 response curves, and non-structural
   carbohydrate content of flag leaf and internodes were measured three to
   four times of day. Spikelet number per panicle and flag leaf area on the
   main culm were recorded. Net C assimilation and TPU decreased
   progressively after midday in panicle-pruned plants, especially under
   800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. This TPU reduction was explained by sucrose
   accumulation in the flag leaf resulting from the sink limitation. Taking
   together, our findings suggest that TPU is involved in the regulation of
   photosynthesis in rice under elevated CO2 conditions, and that sink
   limitation effects should be considered in crop models.

AB Many species of conservation interest exist solely or largely in
   isolated populations. Ideally, prioritization of management actions
   among such populations would be guided by quantitative estimates of
   extinction risk, but conventional methods of demographic population
   viability analysis (PVA) model each population separately and require
   temporally extensive datasets that are rarely available in practice. We
   introduce a general class of statistical PVA that can be applied to many
   populations at once, which we term multiple population viability
   analysis or MPVA. The approach combines models of abundance at multiple
   spatial locations with temporal models of population dynamics,
   effectively borrowing information from more data-rich populations to
   inform inferences for data-poor populations. Covariates are used to
   explain population variability in space and time. Using Bayesian
   analysis, we illustrate the method with a dataset of Lahontan cutthroat
   trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi) observations that previously had
   been analyzed with conventional PVA. We find that MPVA predictions are
   similar in bias and higher in precision than predictions from simple PVA
   models that treat each population individually; moreover, the use of
   covariates in MPVA allows for predictions in minimally-sampled and
   unsampled populations. The basic MPVA model can be extended in multiple
   ways, such as by linking to a sampling and observation model to provide
   a full accounting of uncertainty. We conclude that the approach has
   great potential to expand the use of PVA for species that exist in
   multiple, isolated populations.

AB Plant development studies often generate data in the form of
   multivariate time series, each variable corresponding to a count of
   newly emerged organs for a given development process. These phenological
   data often exhibit highly structured patterns, and the aim of this study
   was to identify such patterns in cultivated strawberry. Six strawberry
   genotypes were observed weekly for their course of emergence of flowers,
   leaves, and stolons during 7 months. We assumed that these phenological
   series take the form of successive phases, synchronous between
   individuals. We applied univariate multiple change-point models for the
   identification of flowering, vegetative development, and runnering
   phases, and multivariate multiple change-point models for the
   identification of consensus phases for these three development
   processes. We showed that the flowering and the runnering processes are
   the main determinants of the phenological pattern. On this basis, we
   propose a typology of the six genotypes in the form of a hierarchical
   classification. This study introduces a new longitudinal data modeling
   approach for the identification of phenological phases in plant
   development. The focus was on development variables but the approach can
   be directly extended to growth variables and to multivariate series
   combining growth and development variables.

AB Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) is a generalist predator native of east and
   central Asia. It is widely distributed and well established in Europe,
   South America, North America, and Oceania. In China, H. axyridis can be
   found from Heilongjiang (northeast China) to Hainan (south China)
   province. Although H. axyridis has been an important biological control
   agent to various insect pests, little research had been done to evaluate
   the geographical effects on the biology and cold tolerance of H.
   axyridis. In this study, we compared morphology, development, fecundity,
   longevity and survivorship of H. axyridis at -3 degrees C from three
   geographical populations: Jilin population (JLP) (43 degrees 48' N),
   Henan population (HNP) (30 degrees 01' N), and Guizhou population (GZP)
   (26 degrees 07' N). The results showed that no significant difference
   was found in body size, oviposition period, and female adult longevity
   among the three populations. However, the colour patterns of H axyridis
   adults were different and the percentages of melanic individuals from
   JLP, HNP and GZP were 4.67%, 28.00% and 51.85%, respectively. The
   developmental time of H. axyridis from HNP (16.32 d) was significantly
   longer than those from JLP or GZP. The preoviposition period of H.
   axyridis from JLP (8.94 d) was significantly longer than those from HNP
   or GZP. The male adult longevity of HNP (86.78 d) was the longest among
   the three populations. Furthermore, we found that the H. axyridis male
   adults had significantly longer longevity than those of the female
   adults for all three populations. Harmonia axyridis from JLP had the
   highest survivorship, followed by those from HNP and GZP regardless of
   sex. Generally, there was a clear trend that egg development time,
   female fecundity, and adult survivorship at -3 degrees C increased with
   increasing latitude.

AB As organisms move into higher latitudes, they may evolve physiological
   mechanisms to survive in harsher climates. One such mechanism is
   supercooling, the capacity to survive at subzero temperatures without
   freezing. While interspecific comparisons reveal greater thermal
   tolerances at higher latitudes in insects and vertebrates, evidence for
   intraspecific evolution in supercooling related to latitude is only
   evident in insects. We measured the supercooling points of lizards from
   12 populations reared from hatch in common laboratory conditions to test
   for evolved differences in supercooling related to winter. Results
   indicate that winter harshness (depth or length) cannot explain
   supercooling points regardless of how data are analyzed, which suggests
   that populations have not evolved greater supercooling capacity. While
   our results are consistent with the idea that thermal physiology is
   evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, we cannot reject several
   alternatives including the possibility that lizards are able to
   behaviorally avoid the extreme temperatures that would select for
   thermal evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Localizing the self in time is fundamental for daily life functioning
   and is lacking in severe disabling neuropsychiatric disorders like
   schizophrenia. Brains keep track of time across an impressive range of
   scales. Great progress has been made in identifying the molecular
   machinery of the circadian clock, the brain's master clock that operates
   on the 24-hour scale and allows animals to know the "time of the day"
   that important events occur, without referring to external cues.
   However, the biology of interval timing, the mechanism responsible for
   durations in the seconds-to-minutes-to-hours range, remains a mystery,
   and an obvious question is whether there is a common biological solution
   for keeping track of time across these 2 time scales. To address this,
   we trained Cry1/Cry2 double knockout mice on an interval timing task
   with durations that ranged between 3 and 27 seconds. The mice were kept
   under constant light conditions to avoid any exogenously induced form of
   daily rhythmicity. We observed that the homozygous knockouts displayed
   as accurate and precise a temporal memory as the control mice. This
   suggests that the Cry1 and Cry2 genes are not an important component of
   the interval timer. Furthermore, proper calibration of the interval
   timer does not depend on a functional circadian clock. Thus, these 2
   timing systems likely rely on different and independent biological
   mechanisms.

PY 2000
AB Developmental integration is the covariation among morphological
   structures due to connections between the developmental processes that
   built them. Here we use the methods of geometric morphometrics to study
   integration in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, we
   focus on the hypothesis that the anterior and posterior wing
   compartments are separate developmental units that vary independently.
   We measured both variation among genetically diverse individuals and
   random differences between body sides of single individuals (fluctuating
   asymmetry, FA). For both of these sources of variation, the patterns of
   variation identified by principal component analyses all involved
   landmarks in both the anterior and posterior compartments
   simultaneously. Analyses focusing exclusively on the covariation between
   the anterior and posterior compartments, by the partial least-squares
   method, revealed pervasive integration of the two compartments, for both
   individual variation and FA. These analyses clearly indicate that the
   anterior and posterior compartments are not separate units of variation,
   but that the covariation between compartments is sufficient to account
   for nearly all the variation throughout the entire wing. We conclude
   that variation among individuals as well as the developmental
   perturbations responsible for FA generate shape variation primarily
   through developmental processes that are integrated across both
   compartments. In contrast, much less of the shape variation in our
   sample can be attributed to the localized processes that establish the
   identity of particular wing veins.

AB Climate change related risks and impacts on ectotherms will be mediated
   by habitats and their influence on local thermal environments. While
   many studies have documented morphological and genetic aspects of niche
   divergence across habitats, few have examined thermal performance across
   such gradients and directly linked this variation to contemporary
   climate change impacts. In this study, we quantified variation in
   thermal performance across a gradient from forest to gallery
   forest-savanna mosaic in Cameroon for a skink species (Trachylepis
   affinis) known to be diverging genetically and morphologically across
   that habitat gradient. Based on these results, we then applied a
   mechanistic modelling approach (NicheMapR) to project changes in
   potential activity, as constrained by thermal performance, in response
   to climate change. As a complimentary approach, we also compared
   mechanistic projections with climate-driven changes in habitat
   suitability based on species distribution models of forest and ecotone
   skinks. We found that ecotone skinks may benefit from warming and
   experience increased activity while forest skinks will likely face a
   drastic decrease in thermal suitability across the forest zone. Species
   distribution models projected that thermal suitability for forest skinks
   in coastal forests would decline but in other parts of the forest zone
   skinks are projected to experience increased thermal suitability. The
   results here highlight the utility of mechanistic approaches in
   revealing and understanding patterns of climate change vulnerability
   which may not be detected with species distribution models alone. This
   study also emphasizes the importance of intra-specific physiological
   variation, and habitat-specific thermal performance relationships in
   particular, in determining warming responses.

AB There is a general consensus that many shark species are declining in
   numbers. However, effective management measures often depend on knowing
   how trends in abundance and distribution are influenced by environmental
   conditions. Several efforts to describe the occurrence and distribution
   of basking sharks Cetorhinus maximus have been made in northern Europe,
   particularly around the UK, but nothing is known regarding their
   occurrence in southern areas, such as the south of Portugal. Using 2
   decades of observational data collected in the south of Portugal, we
   show that the occurrence of basking sharks in the area was highly
   seasonal, with individuals being observed mainly during spring. Based on
   in situ and satellite-derived environmental variables and climate
   indices, we also demonstrate that temporal trends were associated with
   the beginning of the upwelling season and that the inter-annual changes
   were related to lower values of sea surface temperature, North Atlantic
   Oscillation index, upwelling index, 2-mo lagged chlorophyll a and 3-mo
   lagged Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index, and higher values of
   2-mo lagged upwelling index. These findings suggest that basking sharks
   are associated with the expansion of cold waters following upwelling
   events in the region, probably due to the aggregation and increase of
   zooplankton. Although the temperature recorded during our study years
   ranged from 14 to 24 degrees C, sharks were mainly observed when
   temperatures were lower than 20 degrees C, corroborating their
   preference for colder water. This study provides the first knowledge on
   the habitat use of basking sharks in southern European Atlantic areas.

AB Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death, with a very poor
   survival rate. By the time of diagnosis, most cases are at an advanced
   stage and about 30% present with symptoms caused by central
   endobronchial obstruction. Endobronchial cryosurgery is an effective
   technique, which can be used to relieve tracheobronchial obstruction
   caused by lung cancer. This report describes the technique, using a
   nitrous oxide cooled cryoprobe, inserted through a bronchoscope, to
   remove the obstruction and reopen the airway. In this study, 476
   consecutive patients (mean age 68.3 years. M:F ratio 1.9:1) with
   obstructive tracheobronchial tumours underwent a mean of 2.4
   cryosurgical treatments. Their TNM staging was, stage 116.7%, IIIa
   21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Improvement in symptom quantification was
   found with 76.4, 69.0, 59.2, and 42.6% of symptomatic patients for
   haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain, respectively. Mean values
   for respiratory function improved from 1.38 to 1.41 litres for FEV1 and
   1.91 to 2.04 litres for FVC (pless than or equal to0.0001). Mean
   performance status improved from 59.6 to 75.2 for Karnofsky scale and
   3.04 to 2.20 for the WHO scale and the complication rate was 3.5% of
   treatments. The Kaplan-Meier median survival was 8.2 months and 1- and
   2-year survival 38.4 and 15.9%,. respectively. Survival analysis
   suggested a possible survival advantage over alternative palliative
   techniques. Endobronchial cryosurgery provides a safe and effective
   method for the palliation of otherwise inoperable lung cancer. It has
   advantages over other methods in terms of safety, cost, and a low
   complication rate. Cryosurgery can be repeated as often as required. (C)

AB We propose a method of estimating natural mortality of marine pelagic

   estimate size-dependent fecundity. growth and mortality of Pacific
   anchovy (Engroulis japonicus), the most abundant fish species in coastal
   waters off the Korean peninsula, we Undertook a synthesis of results
   from past studies and data. Assuming that the growth coefficient K
   varies with water temperature, we derived a modified von Bertalanffy
   growth equation covering all life stages based on otolith analysis of
   anchovies collected from southwestern coastal area of Korea in 1996. By
   revisting a past study on spawning and egg production of anchovies in
   the southern Korean coastal waters, we calculated a monthly-averaged
   fraction of mature females spawning per day to estimate that an average
   female anchovy spawns 36 times per year, and that the mean number of
   eggs produced by an average female is ca. 160 x 10(3) yr(-1). Accepting
   the 'bigger-is-better' hypothesis, we derived a theoretical mortality
   curve that assumes instantaneous natural mortality as an inverse
   function of anchovy body length. Assuming equilibrium status of stock,
   estimated annual instantaneous mortality of anchovy between egg to age-1
   stage was 11.3 yr(-1) and estimated size-specific mortality was 1.24
   d(-1) mm in fork length. The derived theoretical mortality Curve fit
   well the stage-specific mortalities, which were estimated independently
   based on ichthyoplankton surveys and anchovy samples collected by
   commercial nets, but underestimated the egg mortality (0.89d(-1) vs.
   0.83d(-1)). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In highly seasonal environments such as coastal Newfoundland, local
   production, advection, and life history may influence ichthyoplankton
   community structure. The spring bloom Occurs in cold water that slows
   development of eggs from pelagic spawners and may transport propagules
   from optimal nearshore areas before hatch. For bottom spawners that
   affix eggs to the bottom, the problem is reduced because only actively
   swimming larval stages are pelagic. We hypothesize that larvae of
   pelagic spawners are limited to warmer, summer waters, whereas larvae of
   bottom spawners are less constrained temporally and less subject to
   flushing from the nearshore environment. Ichthyoplankton taxa sampled in
   Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, during spring-summer in 1997-1999 showed
   consistent seasonal peaks in egg and larval abundance. Although pelagic
   egg production spanned spring and summer, larval abundance peaked late
   in summer or early fall in the most productive areas of the bay. Larval
   abundance of bottom spawners peaked in spring for most taxa. Thus,
   pelagic eggs hatch quickly in summer, and larvae can utilize the late
   peak in nearshore copepod abundance. Bottom spawners can utilize spring
   zooplankton because temperature-dependent development does not influence
   egg advection. Coastal advection and temperature influence how different
   life history groups exploit spatial and temporal peaks in production.

   range between -47 and -55 degrees C. Despite such a severe climate, the
   fauna and flora of Yakutia present a considerably rich biodiversity,
   suggesting a high adaptation potential of the organisms in this area. In
   this study, 30 local species of insects belonging to Coleoptera, Diptera
   and Lepidoptera were selected to investigate cold adaptation. The
   identification of the cold adaptation strategy was based on the
   measurement of the insect body supercooling point (SCP) and hemolymph
   ice-nucleating activity. According to the data collected, there is a
   high incidence of freeze tolerant species among the insects found in
   Yakutsk area (Yakutsk, 62 degrees latitude, 130 degrees longitude):
   93.3% of them were freeze tolerant, and only 6.7% were freeze avoiding.
   It is suggested that the evolution of cold hardiness in this region

   that allow the insects to survive extreme cold conditions. (C) 2016

   relationship between body size and temperature across latitude
   consistent with Bergmann's rule, whereas there was a positive
   relationship between these variables along replicate elevational
   gradients at different latitudes. Limb-size variation did not support
   Allen's rule along latitude, nor along elevation. High-elevation ducks
   were smaller and had longer wings than those inhabiting lower elevations
   within a river. We hypothesize that temperature is likely a major
   selective pressure acting on morphology across latitudes, although
   hypoxia or air density may be more important along elevational
   gradients. We conclude that the effect of temperature on morphology, and
   hence the likelihood of documenting ecogeographical 'rules', depends on
   the environmental context in which temperature variation is examined.

AB Rising temperatures accompanying global climate change are expected to
   affect mountain lizards. Therefore, basic information on how these
   ectotherms deal with their thermal environment is important for further
   management. We conducted a field study to evaluate how body temperature
   of the small-sized mountain lizard Eurolophosaurus nanuzae relates to
   the thermal environment. After capture, the body temperature of the
   lizards was measured immediately, quickly followed by the substrate and
   air temperatures, wind intensity, and solar radiation at the capture
   locations. Linear relationships showed that the body temperature of
   individuals was positively related to rocky substrate temperatures but
   negatively related to wind speed. However, air temperature and solar
   radiation were unrelated to body temperature. Although the substrate is
   an important heat source for E. nanuzae, in an open environment it can
   reach temperatures up to 10 degrees C above the maximum body
   temperatures of lizards, and can thus be a low-quality thermal
   substrate. However, individuals seemed to use wind as a cooling source
   to counterbalance the risks of overheating from high substrate
   temperatures. As the montane environment that E. nanuzae inhabits seems
   to have hotter temperatures than those preferred by the species, lizards
   should benefit from the cooling winds to keep their body temperature at
   appropriate levels. Different to previous studies that evaluated wind
   effects on body temperatures of lizards, our results showed that winds
   seemed to promote thermoregulation for E. nanuzae.

AB The increasing occurrence of heatwaves has intensified temperature
   stress on terrestrial vegetation. Here, we investigate how two
   contrasting isoprene-emitting tropical species, Ficus benjamina and
   Pachira aquatica, cope with heat stress and assess the role of internal
   plant carbon sources for isoprene biosynthesis in relation to
   thermotolerance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
   isoprene emissions from P. aquatica. We exposed plants to two levels of
   heat stress and determined the temperature response curves for isoprene
   and photosynthesis. To assess the use of internal C sources in isoprene
   biosynthesis, plants were fed with C-13 position-labelled pyruvate. F.
   benjamina was more heat tolerant with higher constitutive isoprene
   emissions and stronger acclimation to higher temperatures than P.
   aquatica, which showed higher induced isoprene emissions at elevated
   temperatures. Under heat stress, both isoprene emissions and the
   proportion of cytosolic pyruvate allocated into isoprene synthesis
   increased. This represents a mechanism that P. aquatica, and to a lesser
   extent F. benjamina, has adopted as an immediate response to sudden
   increase in heat stress. However, in the long run under prolonged heat,
   the species with constitutive emissions (F. benjamina) was better
   adapted, indicating that plants that invest more carbon into protective
   emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds tend to suffer less
   from heat stress.

AB Thylakoid membrane-bound FtsH proteases have a well-characterized role
   in degradation of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein D1
   upon repair of photodamaged PSII. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana) var1 and var2 mutants, devoid of the FtsH5 and
   FtsH2 proteins, respectively, are capable of normal D1 protein turnover
   under moderate growth light intensity. Instead, they both demonstrate a
   significant scarcity of PSI complexes. It is further shown that the
   reduced level of PSI does not result from accelerated photodamage of the
   PSI centers in var1 or var2 under moderate growth light intensity. On
   the contrary, radiolabeling experiments revealed impaired synthesis of
   the PsaA/B reaction center proteins of PSI, which was accompanied by the
   accumulation of PSI-specific assembly factors. psaA/B transcript
   accumulation and translation initiation, however, occurred in var1 and
   var2 mutants as in wild-type Arabidopsis, suggesting problems in later
   stages of PsaA/B protein expression in the two var mutants. Presumably,
   the thylakoid membrane-bound FtsH5 and FtsH2 have dual functions in the
   maintenance of photosynthetic complexes. In addition to their function
   as a protease in the degradation of the photodamaged D1 protein, they
   also are required, either directly or indirectly, for early assembly of
   the PSI complexes.

AB The uncertainties and sources of variation in projected impacts of
   climate change on agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems depend not only
   on the emission scenarios and climate models used for projecting future
   climates, but also on the impact models used, and the local soil and
   climatic conditions of the managed or unmanaged ecosystems under study.
   We addressed these uncertainties by applying different impact models at
   site, regional and continental scales, and by separating the variation
   in simulated relative changes in ecosystem performance into the
   different sources of uncertainty and variation using analyses of
   variance. The crop and ecosystem models used output from a range of
   global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs) projecting climate
   change over Europe between 1961-1990 and 2071-2 100 under the IPCC SIZES
   scenarios. The projected impacts on productivity of crops and ecosystems
   included the direct effects of increased CO2 concentration on
   photosynthesis. The variation in simulated results attributed to
   differences between the climate models were, in all cases, smaller than
   the variation attributed to either emission scenarios or local
   conditions. The methods used for applying the climate model outputs
   played a larger role than the choice of the GCM or RCM. The thermal
   suitability for grain maize cultivation in Europe was estimated to
   expand by 30-50% across all SRES emissions scenarios. Strong increases
   in net primary productivity (NPP) (35-54%) were projected in Dorthem
   European ecosystems as a result of a longer growing season and higher
   CO2 concentrations. Changing water balance dominated the projected
   responses of southern European ecosystems, with NPP declining or
   increasing only slightly relative to preserit-day conditions. Both site
   and continental scale models showed large increases in yield of rain-fed
   winter wheat for northern Europe, with smaller increases or even
   decreases in southern Europe. Site-based, regional and continental scale
   models showed large spatial variations in the response of nitrate
   leaching from winter wheat cultivation to projected climate change due
   to strong interactions with soils and climate. The variation in
   simulated impacts was smaller between scenarios based on RCMs nested
   within the same GCM than between scenarios based on different GCMs or
   between emission scenarios.

AB Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), acclimated to 5 degrees C, were equipped
   with ultrasonic transmitters which allowed the continuous monitoring of
   their vertical movements and heart rate, Fish were then placed in a 125
   m(3) tower tank in which the various thermal conditions they encounter
   in their natural environment were reproduced, Physiological and
   behavioural responses of cod were followed in parallel to the induced
   environmental changes, The experimental conditions studied in the tower
   tank were also reproduced in a swimming respirometer, where oxygen
   consumption and heart rate could be monitored within the activity range
   of a free-swimming animal.
   In a homogeneous water column, a rise in temperature induced marked
   increases in fish swimming activity, heart rate and heart beat-to-beat
   variability, In a thermally stratified environment, voluntary activity
   also increased when the thermal structure of the water column was
   altered, though no temperature-dependent changes in heart rate were
   observed, In this case, fish avoided the new temperature conditions,
   exhibiting distinct thermoregulatory behaviour, Stratification of the
   water column also prompted daily cyclic changes in fish distribution,
   animals tending to be in deeper and colder water layers during the day
   and in shallower and warmer layers at night.
   Respirometry experiments revealed that the thermoregulatory behaviour
   observed in free-ranging fish was probably driven by the energetic
   expedient of maintaining the physiological status quo - i.e. avoiding
   bioenergically costly reacclimation processes, Indeed, acute temperature
   increases or decreases of 2.5 degrees C led to marked differences in
   oxygen consumption, with metabolic rate changes of 15 and 30%,
   respectively, The persistent linear relationship between heart rate and
   oxygen consumption allowed us to estimate, from the heart rate recorded
   in free-swimming fish, the entire range of metabolic responses that cod
   underwent voluntarily while experiencing a thermally stratified water
   column, The most profound metabolic effect, however, was observed with
   feeding, when oxygen consumption increased by as much as 80%, resulting
   in an estimated 90% reduction in their subsequent scope for activity.

AB Changes in temperature regimes are occurring globally due to climate
   change as well as habitat alterations. Temperatures are expected to
   continue to rise in the future, along with a greater degree of climatic
   instability. Such changes could have potentially serious consequences
   for oviparous ectotherms, especially those with temperature-dependent
   sex determination. To investigate the effects of temperature on a range
   of developmental phenomena in a population of western pond turtles (Emys
   marmorata), we placed temperature sensors on top of each layer of eggs
   within nests and recorded temperatures hourly through the first 2-3 mo
   of incubation. These methods allowed us to look at in situ nest
   temperatures with high resolution. We found that mean incubation
   temperatures were similar between different nests and at different
   levels within nests but that incubation temperature fluctuations and
   maximum incubation temperatures differed greatly in both cases. The
   hatchling turtles were more likely to be female if they spent 30% or
   more of their sex-determining period of incubation above 29 degrees C.
   Hatching success was best predicted by the maximum incubation
   temperature. We also found that incubation duration tended to be shorter
   as the mean temperature increased. However, exposure to either extremely
   high or low temperatures extended incubation times.

AB Within the Gulf of California, the Midriff Islands Region (MIR) is
   characterized by mixing conditions of water masses that lead to high
   primary productivity, which fosters the presence of sardines, anchovies,
   and their predators. Using acoustic tools, we analyzed the presence and
   characteristics of schools detected in three surveys carried out in late
   spring of 2012 and 2013 and early summer of 2014. We sought to relate
   changes in the geographical distribution of schools with Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The largest number
   of schools was observed in 2012, coinciding with the highest and most
   extensive NPP, while the following years were associated with lower NPP
   coupled with a lower number of detections. During the study period, the
   Ballenas-Salsipuedes Channel and its area of influence showed the lowest
   SST and higher NPP even toward the summer as compared to the rest of the
   MIR, favoring the presence of fish schools and supporting the importance
   of this site as a feeding center for these species. As for their
   vertical distribution, it was found that during the day schools reach
   greater depths, while during the night these are concentrated in surface
   waters. However, no differences in size, density, or other
   characteristics were detected either between periods or between years.
   Finally, we found a high proportion of schools during the night (61%),
   which departs from the typical nocturnal dispersal behavior described
   for similar species in other areas.

   flow to both the pulmonary and systemic circulations, which was not

   warming and cooling, while systemic resistance decreased during heating
   and increased during cooling, indicating a barostatic response. There
   was a large right-to-left (R-L) shunt during warming and cooling in
   untreated animals, resulted in a large L-R shunt, which decreased during
   warming and increased during cooling. Nevertheless, heating rates were
   the same in untreated and atropinised animals, and cooling rates were

AB Embryos of annual killifish diapause in soil egg banks while ponds are
   dry. Their rates of development and survival in different developmental
   stages determine the numbers and stages of embryos at rewetting. In the
   Argentinean pearlfish Austrolebias bellottii, we investigated plasticity
   for desiccation in such embryonal life history components across phases
   of mild desiccation and rewetting and also effects of life history on
   hatching. In comparison with nonannuals, our data suggest that
   incidences of diapause have become relatively independent of the
   occurrence of desiccation, as if they have become genetically
   assimilated. We found limited survival effects of desiccation, limited
   developmental delays, and an acceleration of development into the
   prehatching stage. This response can be adaptive when desiccation
   informs that an opportunity to hatch approaches. Embryos arrest
   development in the prehatching stage (diapause DIII) or in the
   dispersed-cell phase (diapause DI). Parental pair variation in rates of
   development and survival in the earliest developmental stages affects
   the fraction of embryos that are in DI at rewetting and the number
   surviving. Given such effects on life history fitness components, rates
   during embryonal development seem "visible" to selection and the
   developmental system can thus adapt when pair variation contains a
   heritable component. In agreement with expectations for the presence of
   diversified bet-hedging, some embryos hatched and others not in over
   half of the clutches with several developed embryos at the moment of
   rewetting. Hatching probabilities increased for eggs produced later in
   the experiment, and they increased when embryos were rewetted a second
   time after two months. This response is opposite of what is expected
   when age-dependent hatching would be adapted to exploit opportunities
   for completing another generation before the dry season.

AB Palaeoecological records provide a rich source of information to explore
   how plant distribution ranges respond to climate changes, but their use
   is complicated by the fact that, especially when based on pollen data,
   they are often spatially too inaccurate to reliably determine past range
   limits. To solve this problem, we focus on hazel (Corylus avellana), a
   tree species with large and heavy fruits (nuts), which provide firm
   evidence of the local occurrence of species in the past. We combine the
   fossil nut records of hazel from Fennoscandia, map its maximum
   distribution range during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) and compare
   the fossil record with the Holocene hazel range shift as simulated by
   the LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model. The results show that the
   current northern range limit of hazel in central and eastern
   Fennoscandia is constrained by too short growing seasons and too long
   and cold winters and demonstrate that the species responded to the HTM
   warming of about 2.5 degrees C (relative to the present) by shifting its
   range limit up to 63-64 degrees N, reached a rough equilibrium with the
   HTM climatic conditions and retreated from there to about 60 degrees N
   during the last 4000 years in response to the late-Holocene cooling.
   Thus, the projected future warming of about 2.5 degrees C would reverse
   the long-term southward retraction of species' northern range limit in
   Europe and is likely to lead to hazel being a common, regeneratively
   reproductive species up to 63-64 degrees N. In addition to the accuracy
   of the projected warming, the likelihood of this scenario will depend on
   inter-specific competition with other tree taxa and the potential of
   hazel to migrate and its population to grow in balance with the warming.
   In general, the range dynamics from the HTM to the present suggest a
   tight climatic control over hazel's range limit in Fennoscandia.

AB Human-shark encounters garner a disproportionate amount of public
   attention. Long-term datasets from shark mitigation programs can help
   determine the environmental conditions that influence abundance of
   potentially dangerous sharks. We used 25 yr (1992-2016) of shark catches
   from the New South Wales (NSW) Shark Meshing Program (SMP) to model the
   abundance of all potentially dangerous shark species (tiger Galeocerdo
   cuvier, white Carcharodon carcharias and whaler sharks [genus
   Carcharhinus]) and individual species/genus to determine: (1) the
   temporal/spatial variability in catches and (2) the oceanographic and
   physical variables that could influence abundance. Too few tiger sharks
   were caught to individually model their abundance. Generalised additive
   mixed models revealed seasonal and inter-annual abundance trends that
   differ between white and whaler sharks. Overall, sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs), years with SSTs colder or warmer than the long-term
   average, El Nino events, moon illumination, and beach length influenced
   the abundance of shark groups tested. White shark abundance was highest
   during water temperatures of similar to 17-18 degrees C and declined
   when SST increased above 19 degrees C. Whaler abundance increased with
   higher SSTs. Shark abundance was higher during El Nino events than
   during La Nina, although the number of whalers caught was highest during
   neutral phases. All groups showed a decrease in the number of catches
   with increasing moon illumination and higher abundance on longer
   beaches. These results may aid public safety methods aimed at reducing
   human-shark encounters by highlighting when higher numbers of sharks may
   occur.

AB The lizard family Phrynosomatidae comprises three subclades: the closely
   related sand and horned lizards, and their relatives the Sceloporus
   group. This family exhibits great variation in ecology, behavior, and
   general body plan. Previous studies also show that this family exhibits
   great diversity in locomotor performance abilities; as measured on a
   high-speed treadmill, sand lizards are exceptionally fast sprinters,
   members of the Sceloporus group are intermediate, and horned lizards are
   slowest. These differences are paralleled by differences in relative
   hindlimb span. To determine if muscle fiber-type composition also varies
   among the three subclades, we examined the iliofibularis (IF), a
   hindlimb muscle used in lizard locomotion, in 11 species of
   phrynosomatid lizards. Using histochemical assays for myosin ATPase, an
   indicator of fast-twitch capacity, and succinic dehydrogenase, denoting
   oxidative capacity, we classified fiber types into three categories
   based on existing nomenclature: fast-twitch glycolytic (FG), fast-twitch
   oxidative-glycolytic (FOG), and slow-twitch oxidative (SO). Sand lizards
   have a high proportion of FG fibers (64-70%) and a low proportion of FOG
   fibers (25-33%), horned lizards are the converse (FG fibers 25-31%, FOG
   fibers 56-66%), and members of the Sceloporus group are intermediate for
   both FG (41-48%) and FOG (42-45%) content. Hence, across all 11 species
   %FOG and %FG are strongly negatively correlated. Analysis with
   phylogenetically independent contrasts indicate that this negative
   relationship is entirely attributable to the divergence between sand and
   horned lizards. The %SO also varies among the three subclades. Results
   from conventional nested ANCOVA (with log body mass as a covariate)
   indicate that the log mean cross-sectional area of individual muscle
   fibers differs among species and is positively correlated with body mass
   across species, but does not differ significantly among subclades. The
   log cross-sectional area of the IF vanes among species, but does not
   vary among subclades. Conversely, the total thigh muscle cross-sectional
   area does not vary among species, but does vary among subclades; horned
   lizards have slimmer thighs. Muscle fiber-type composition appears to
   form part of a coadapted suite of traits, along with relative limb and
   muscle sizes, that affect the locomotor abilities of phrynosomatid
   lizards. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Intertidal fish species face gradual chronic changes in temperature and
   greater extremes of acute thermal exposure through climate-induced
   warming. As sea temperatures rise, it has been proposed that
   whole-animal performance will be impaired through oxygen and capacity
   limited thermal tolerance [OCLTT; reduced aerobic metabolic scope (MS)]
   and, on acute exposure to high temperatures, thermal safety margins may
   be reduced because of constrained acclimation capacity of upper thermal
   limits. Using the New Zealand triplefin fish (Forsterygion lapillum),
   this study addressed how performance in terms of growth and metabolism
   (MS) and upper thermal tolerance limits would be affected by chronic
   exposure to elevated temperature. Growth was measured in fish acclimated
   (12 weeks) to present and predicted future temperatures and metabolic
   rates were then determined in fish at acclimation temperatures and with
   acute thermal ramping. In agreement with the OCLTT hypothesis, chronic
   exposure to elevated temperature significantly reduced growth
   performance and MS. However, despite the prospect of impaired growth
   performance under warmer future summertime conditions, an annual growth
   model revealed that elevated temperatures may only shift the timing of
   high growth potential and not the overall annual growth rate. While the
   upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima) increased with
   exposure to warmer temperatures and was associated with depressed
   metabolic rates during acute thermal ramping, upper thermal tolerance
   did not differ between present and predicted future summertime
   temperatures. This suggests that warming may progressively decrease
   thermal safety margins for hardy generalist species and could limit the
   available habitat range of intertidal populations.

AB This study was to elucidate thermoregulation in dehydrated heat-exposed
   broilers. When broilers were dehydrated, heat production (HP), comb
   surface temperature (Tcs) and respiration rate (RR) decreased
   significantly. Conversely, rectal (Tr) and back skin (Tbs) temperatures,
   whole blood viscosity (WBV), haematocrit (HCT), plasma protein
   concentration (PPC) and plasma osmolality (PO) increased. During heat
   exposure, HP, WBV, HCT and PPC decreased significantly, while Tr, Tcs,
   Tbs and RR increased. The onset of panting against rectal temperature
   was delayed in dehydrated birds. These results suggest that dehydration
   leads to a lower blood volume, resulting in a decrease in blood flow to
   heat exchange organs and surfaces in broilers. This induces a lower
   sensible heat loss from extremities, a lower evaporative heat loss and a
   higher sensible heat loss from trunk, subsequent to regulate their body
   temperature at a higher level of deep body temperature. (C) 1999

AB Elucidating how life history traits vary geographically is important to
   understanding variation in population dynamics. Because many aspects of
   ectotherm life history are climate-dependent, geographic variation in
   climate is expected to have a large impact on population dynamics
   through effects on annual survival, body size, growth rate, age at first
   reproduction, size-fecundity relationship, and reproductive frequency.
   The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is a small, imperiled North
   American rattlesnake with a distribution centered on the Great Lakes
   region, where lake effects strongly influence local conditions. To
   address Eastern Massasauga life history data gaps, we compiled data from
   47 study sites representing 38 counties across the range. We used
   multimodel inference and general linear models with geographic
   coordinates and annual climate normals as explanatory variables to
   clarify patterns of variation in life history traits. We found strong
   evidence for geographic variation in six of nine life history variables.
   Adult female snout-vent length and neonate mass increased with
   increasing mean annual precipitation. Litter size decreased with
   increasing mean temperature, and the size-fecundity relationship and
   growth prior to first hibernation both increased with increasing
   latitude. The proportion of gravid females also increased with
   increasing latitude, but this relationship may be the result of
   geographically varying detection bias. Our results provide insights into
   ectotherm life history variation and fill critical data gaps, which will
   inform Eastern Massasauga conservation efforts by improving biological
   realism for models of population viability and climate change.

AB The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) varies
   significantly in individual growth rates and life-history traits
   (maturation, reproduction, and survival) among adjacent populations in
   nature. This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental
   components of the substantial among-population variation in growth
   rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either
   mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a
   common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet,
   frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were
   identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures
   (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in
   nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore
   snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to
   affect first-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in
   the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in
   the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were
   gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in
   environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both
   that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that
   these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small
   geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for
   large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These
   results are considered in the context of population colonization
   history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate
   variation.

AB Phenological variability among populations is widespread in nature. A
   few predictive phenological models integrate intrapopulational
   variability, but none has ever explored the individual strategies
   potentially occurring within a population. The "pace-of-life" syndrome
   accounts for such individual strategies, but has yet to be explored
   under a phenological context. Here we integrated, for the first time,
   the slow-fast thermal strategies stemming from the "pace-of-life" into a
   mechanistic predictive framework. We obtained 4619 phenological
   observations of an important crop pest in the Bolivian Andes by
   individually following 840 individuals under five rearing temperatures
   and across nine life stages. The model calibrated with the observed
   individual "pace-of-life" strategies showed a higher accuracy in
   phenological predictions than when accounting for intrapopulational
   variability alone. We further explored our framework with generated data
   and suggest that ectotherm species with a high number of life stages and
   with slow and/or fast individuals should exhibit a greater variance of
   populational phenology, resulting in a potentially longer time window of
   interaction with other species. We believe that the "pace-of-life"
   framework is a promising approach to improve phenological prediction
   across a wide array of species.

AB El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a global climate variablility,
   which fundamentally influences environmental patterns of the Humboldt
   Current System (HCS) off Chile and Peru. The surf clams Donax obesulus
   and Mesodesma donacium are dominant and highly productive bivalves of
   exposed sandy beaches of the HCS. Existing knowledge indicates that El
   Nino (EN, warm phase of ENSO) and La Nina (LN, cold phase of ENSO)
   affect populations of both species in a different way, although
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects is still
   lacking. The aim of this study was to test hypotheses attempting to
   explain field observations on the effect of strong EN or LN events by
   using controlled experimental conditions. Growth and mortality rates of
   both species were registered during a four-week experiment under EN
   temperature conditions, normal temperature conditions and LN temperature
   conditions. While D. obesulus exhibited reduced growth and higher
   mortality under LN conditions, M. donacium showed reduced growth and
   higher mortality under EN conditions. The results clearly indicate
   different temperature tolerance windows for each species, possibly
   reflecting the evolutionary origins of the Donacidae and Mesodesmatidae
   in regions with contrasting temperature regimes. These results provide
   experimental support for previous hypotheses suggesting that thermal
   tolerance is the driving factor behind observed changes in the species
   distributions of D. obesulus and M. donacium during the extreme phases
   of ENSO. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how natural populations will respond to rapid
   anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest challenges for
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Much research has focussed on
   whether physiological traits can evolve quickly enough under rapidly
   increasing temperatures. While the simple Breeder's equation helps to
   understand how extreme temperatures and genetic variation might drive
   within-population evolution under climate change, it does not consider
   two key areas: how different forms of phenotypic plasticity interact and
   variation among populations. Plasticity can modify the exposure to
   climatic extremes and the strength of selection from those extremes,
   while differences among populations provide adaptive diversity not
   apparent within them. Here, we focus on terrestrial vertebrates and,
   with a case study on a tropical lizard, demonstrate the complex
   interplay between spatial, genetic and plastic contributions to
   variation in climate-relevant physiological traits. We identify several
   problems that need to be better understood: which traits are under
   selection in a changing climate; the different forms of plasticity
   relevant to population persistence and rapid evolution; plastic versus
   genetic contributions to geographic variation in climate-associated
   traits and whether plasticity can be harnessed to promote persistence of
   species. Given ongoing uncertainties around whether natural populations
   can evolve rapidly enough to persist, we advocate the use of field
   trials aimed at increasing rates of adaptation, especially in systems
   known to be strongly impacted by human-driven changes in climate.

AB Tropical scleractinian corals are particularly vulnerable to global
   warming as elevated sea surface temperatures (SSTs) disrupt the delicate
   balance between the coral host and their algal endosymbionts, leading to
   symbiont expulsion, mass bleaching and mortality. While satellite
   sensing of SST has proved a reliable predictor of coral bleaching at the
   regional scale, there are large deviations in bleaching severity and
   mortality on the local scale that are poorly understood. Here, we show
   that internal waves play a major role in explaining local coral
   bleaching and mortality patterns in the Andaman Sea. Despite a severe
   region-wide SST anomaly in May 2010, frequent upslope intrusions of cold
   sub-pycnocline waters due to breaking large-amplitude internal waves
   (LAIW) mitigated coral bleaching and mortality in shallow waters. In
   LAIW-sheltered waters, by contrast, bleaching-susceptible species
   suffered severe bleaching and total mortality. These findings suggest
   that LAIW benefit coral reefs during thermal stress and provide local
   refugia for bleaching-susceptible corals. LAIW are ubiquitous in
   tropical stratified waters and their swash zones may thus be important
   conservation areas for the maintenance of coral diversity in a warming
   climate. Taking LAIW into account can significantly improve coral
   bleaching predictions and provide a valuable tool for coral reef
   conservation and management.

AB Organisms that are distributed across spatial climate gradients often
   exhibit adaptive local variations in morphological and physiological
   traits, but to what extent such gradients shape evolutionary responses
   is still unclear. Given the strong natural contrast in latitudinal
   temperature gradients between the North-American Pacific and Atlantic
   coast, we asked how increases in vertebral number (VN, known as Jordan's
   Rule) with latitude would differ between Pacific (Atherinops affinis)
   and Atlantic Silversides (Menidia menidia), two ecologically equivalent
   and taxonomically similar fishes with similar latitudinal distributions.
   VN was determined from radiographs of wild-caught adults (genetic +
   environmental differences) and its genetic basis confirmed by rearing
   offspring in common garden experiments. Compared to published data on VN
   variation in M. menidia (a mean increase of 7.0 vertebrae from 32 to 46
   degrees N, VN slope = 0.42 lat(-1)), the latitudinal VN increase in
   Pacific Silversides was approximately half as strong (a mean increase of
   3.3 vertebrae from 28 to 43 degrees N, VN slope = 0.23 lat(-1)). This
   mimicked the strong Atlantic (1.11 degrees C lat(-1)) versus weak
   Pacific latitudinal gradient (0.40 degrees C lat(-1)) in median annual
   sea surface temperature (SST). Importantly, the relationship of VN to
   SST was not significantly different between the two species (average
   slope = -0.39 vertebrae degrees C-1), thus suggesting a common thermal
   dependency of VN in silverside fishes. Our findings provide novel
   support for the hypothesis that temperature gradients are the ultimate
   cause of Jordan's Rule, even though its exact adaptive significance
   remains speculative. A second investigated trait, the mode of sex
   determination in Atlantic versus Pacific Silversides, revealed patterns
   that were inconsistent with our expectation: M. menidia displays
   temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) at low latitudes, where
   growing seasons are long or unconstrained, but also a gradual shift to
   genetic sex determination (GSD) with increasing latitude due to more and
   more curtailed growing seasons. Sex ratios in A. affinis, on the other
   hand, were independent of latitude and rearing temperature (indicating
   GSD), even though growing seasons are thermally unconstrained across
   most of the geographical distribution of A. affinis. This suggests that
   additional factors (e.g., longevity) play an important role in shaping
   the mode of sex determination in silverside fishes.

AB We used a monophyletic group of four natural populations of Arabidopsis
   thaliana expanded from a single ancestor along the Yangtze River c. 90
   000 yr ago to study the molecular mechanism of the divergence in their
   freezing tolerance, in order to gain an insight into the genetic basis
   of their local adaption to low temperatures.
   Freezing tolerance assays, measurements of metabolites in the raffinose
   biosynthesis pathway and transactivation-activity assays of variation in
   forms of cold-responsive transcription factors were conducted on the
   four populations. Quantitative trait locus mapping was adopted with F-2
   populations of the most- and least freezing-tolerant populations.
   The degree of freezing tolerance among the four populations was
   negatively correlated with the lowest monthly average temperature of
   January in their native habitats, and positively correlated to the
   expression level of some cold-regulated genes. We identified a major
   locus harboring three cold-responsive transcription factor genes CBF1-3,
   and found a nucleotide insertion in CBF2 in all populations except
   SXcgx, which generated a dysfunctional CBF2 protein.
   The CBF2 in SXcgx experienced a stronger natural selection in the cooler
   environment after CBF3 lost its response to low temperature, which
   possibly reflects a local adaptation of these populations during the
   expansion from a common ancestor.

AB Interannual variability of the physical environment in the eastern
   tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) and biological effects of this variability
   are reviewed and compared to variability in the northeastern Pacific. El
   Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scale variability of 2 to 7 yr periods
   is dominant in the eastern equatorial Pacific and decadal scale
   variability of 10 to 30 yr periods is dominant in the northeastern
   Pacific. In the eastern Pacific warm pool at the center of the ETP,
   temporal variability at any scale is relatively low. ENSO warm (El Nino)
   and cold (La Nina) events have had a variety of effects on marine
   populations and ecosystems, but these effects are generally followed by
   recovery within a few years. El Nino effects such as mortality or
   reproductive failure are most severe on populations dependent on local
   feeding or breeding grounds in coastal waters or around islands. Decadal
   variability has also caused change in populations and ecosystems. Most
   of these effects have been observed in the California Current, Gulf of
   Alaska, and other well studied regions of the Pacific.. The 1976-1977
   phase change or 'regime shift' is the most well known case of decadal
   variability. It affected the physical environment throughout the Pacific
   Ocean and had major effects on North Pacific ecosystems. No regime shift
   has been detected in the ETP since 1977. However, ENSO variability
   continues, an unusually persistent warming prevailed in the early 1990s
   and the thermocline has shoaled in the ETP warm pool area since 1980.
   Potential population effects on dolphin stocks are discussed.
   Interaction of environmental changes with other factors, such as fishery
   stress or mortality, may also induce population effects.

AB It is important to identify the factors that affect the evolutionary
   potential of populations to respond to environmental changes. Such
   processes are for example the ones affecting the amount of heritable
   phenotypic variation in a population. We examined factors explaining the
   wide phenotypic variation in the genetically determined black-brown
   dorsal colouration of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during
   a period of > 50 years in a northern European breeding population. We
   demonstrate that the temperature-dependent relative breeding success of
   brown males predicts the inter-annual change in the proportion of the
   brown male phenotype. The proportion of brown males also appears to
   reflect immigration from Central Europe, where the brown type prevails
   due to local selection pressure. Warm springs in northern Central Europe
   had a positive effect on the proportion of the brown phenotype in the
   north in the early part of the study period, which suggests prolonged
   migration in favourable conditions. However, the association between
   warm springs and a high proportion of brown males has weakened from the
   1950s to the present, which may explain why the proportion of the brown
   males in our study area decreased by a third during the period 1954 to
   2008. This is likely a result of decreasing population size in Central
   Europe. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in
   environmental conditions is maintaining variation in the pied flycatcher
   male phenotype. They also indicate that climate warming has the
   potential to change the population composition both through
   temperature-dependent selection and environmental factors affecting
   long-distance immigration.

   than 80% of the studied phenological phases have advanced during
   springtime, whereas changes are smaller during summer and autumn.
   Significant values of plant and bird phases have advanced 5-20 days, and
   fish phases have advanced 10-30 days in the spring period. Estonia's
   average air temperature has become significantly warmer in spring, while
   at the same time a slight decrease in air temperature has been detected
   in autumn. The growing season has become significantly longer in the
   maritime climate area of Western Estonia. The investigated phenological
   and climate trends are related primarily to changes in the North
   Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) during the winter months. Although the
   impact of the winter NAOI on the phases decreases towards summer, the
   trends of the investigated phases remain high. The trends of phenophases
   at the end of spring and the beginning of summer may be caused by the
   temperature inertia of the changing winter, changes in the radiation
   balance or the direct consequences of human impacts such as land use,
   heat islands or air pollution.

AB Contemporary climate change has been linked to widespread changes in
   phenology and in the geographic distribution of species. Based on
   Bergmann's rule, body sizes of birds have been predicted to decline as
   global temperatures increase. We examined changes in body size of 20
   resident and short-distance migrant passerine species in eastern North
   America between 1980 and 2012, and how changes in resident species
   related to annual mean summer and mean winter temperatures. We found
   that wing length generally increased and that fat-free mass did not
   change significantly. Fat score, a measure of body condition, declined
   over time. However, changes in wing length, fat-free mass, and fat score
   all showed significant variation across species. For resident species,
   increasing mean summer temperatures were generally associated with
   shorter wing lengths, but were not related to fat-free mass or fat
   score. Increasing mean winter temperatures were associated with reduced
   fat-free mass but not with wing length or fat score. Temperature effects
   did not vary significantly across species for any of the three measures.
   Across resident species, the magnitude of body size change over time was
   not related to the influence of mean winter or mean summer temperatures,
   and may have been driven by other factors. Our findings contrast with
   those from a study at a nearby bird banding station, in which widespread
   decreases in wing length and fat-free mass were observed. Our results
   demonstrate that populations of the same species can exhibit opposing
   changes in body size over short geographic distances (< 250 km). We
   conclude that changes in body size are heterogeneous over short time
   scales and can vary across and within species over short distances.
   Continued advances in understanding how body size changes relate to
   climate change must embrace this inherent complexity and consider
   alternative hypotheses.

AB 1. Population differences in physiological responses are examined in
   Thorectes lusitanicus, an endemic Iberian dung beetle species, by
   submitting individuals of different populations to the same experimental
   and acclimation conditions. 2. An infrared thermography protocol was
   used, consisting of three assays: start of activity, cold response, and
   heat response. Individuals of 12 populations were studied and the
   comparative explanatory capacities of several environmental factors in
   relation to the observed inter-population differences were examined. 3.
   The heating rate from chill coma to the beginning of activity was the
   variable with the highest discrimination power among the studied
   populations, accounting for 94% of the observed variance. Regarding the
   heat response, only six of the 16 thermal variables reached significance
   (inter-population differences accounted for 52-74% in these six thermal
   parameters). 4. From the three considered environmental factors
   (Mediterranean climate, land cover, and trophic characteristics) only
   land cover characteristics remain statistically significant, affecting
   the cold response of individuals. 5. Thorectes lusitanicus is a species
   characterised by a high diversity of thermotolerance and recovery traits
   across populations with a low degree of association with broad
   environmental factors. Finally, it is suggested that the apterous
   character of this species could be a determinant factor explaining the
   high diversity of ecophysiological traits related to thermal stress
   tolerance and the recovery time.

   of California. Our aim is to help clarify the relation between
   abundances of cysts of G. catenatum and regional changes in the sea
   surface temperature and nutrient availability at a decadal scale. The
   record was obtained from core samples of laminated sediments dated with
   C-14, representing conditions in thearea from 1483 to 1967 (PCM99-74C-5)
   and from 1907 to 1994 (PCM00-61C-4). Samples were treated with normal
   palynological processing, without oxidation, and using Lycopodium spores
   for quantification. The palynological assemblages observed contain
   varied and abundant terrestrial and marine components. However, we focus
   on the abundance of G. catenatum, due to its toxicity and the resulting
   impact in the area. This species is currently common in the area, and
   according to our results has been present there since - 1483. Cysts of
   G. catenatum are generally abundant in the 20th century, with maximum
   concentrations observed from 1888 to 1920, and from 1945 to 1965, but
   they show a steady decrease in the latter part of the century
   (1965-1994). Before 1830, abundances of G. catenatum were low because of
   increased upwelling conditions, probably related to a higher variability
   of the winter sea surface temperatures in the area. Both our data in the
   20th century and the actual reports in the area, indicate a close
   relation with sea surface temperature. From 1907 to 1994 cyst abundances
   seem to increase during cool La Nina conditions in the area, and
   decrease during warmer El Nino events. They also show an evident
   decrease in cyst abundance from 1970 to 1994, while the sea surface
   temperature in the area increased during the same period. This inverse
   relation is also indicated by the low abundances of G. catenatum
   observed during red tide events, combined with high sea surface
   temperatures in Mazatlan. Additionally, our results do not show any
   relation of G. catenatum blooms and anthropogenic activity in the area.

   radiation (OLR); sea surface temperature (SST) and vertically integrated
   moisture content anomaly with 32 years (1981-2013) observation. The MOK
   is classified as early, delayed, or normal by considering the mean
   monsoon onset date over Kerala to be the 1st of June with a standard
   deviation of 8 days. The objective of the study is to identify the
   synoptic setup during MOK and comparison with climatology to estimate
   the predictability of the onset type (early, normal, or delayed) with 5,
   10, and 15 days lead time. The study reveals that an enhanced convection
   observed over the Bay of Bengal during early MOK is found to shift over
   the Arabian Sea during delayed MOK. An intense high-pressure zone
   observed over the western south Indian Ocean during early MOK shifts to
   the east during delayed MOK. Higher tropospheric temperature (TT) over
   the western Equatorial Ocean during early MOK and lower TT over the
   Indian subcontinent intensify the land-ocean thermal contrast that leads
   to early MOK. The sea surface temperature (SST) over the Arabian Sea is
   observed to be warmer during delayed than early MOK. During early MOK,
   the source of 850 hPa southwesterly wind shifts to the west equatorial
   zone while a COL region has been found during delayed MOK at that level.
   The study further reveals that the wind speed anomaly at the 200-hPa
   pressure level coincides inversely with the anomaly of tropospheric
   temperature.

AB Rapid climate warming has resulted in shrub expansion, mainly of erect
   deciduous shrubs in the Low Arctic, but the more extreme, sparsely
   vegetated, cold and dry High Arctic is generally considered to remain
   resistant to such shrub expansion in the next decades. Dwarf shrub
   dendrochronology may reveal climatological causes of past changes in
   growth, but is hindered at many High Arctic sites by short and
   fragmented instrumental climate records. Moreover, only few High Arctic
   shrub chronologies cover the recent decade of substantial warming. This
   study investigated the climatic causes of growth variability of the
   evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona between 1927 and 2012 in the
   northernmost polar desert at 83 degrees N in North Greenland. We
   analysed climate-growth relationships over the period with available
   instrumental data (1950-2012) between a 102-year-long C.tetragona shoot
   length chronology and instrumental climate records from the three
   nearest meteorological stations, gridded climate data, and North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices. July
   extreme maximum temperatures (JulT(emx)), as measured at Alert, Canada,
   June NAO, and previous October AO, together explained 41% of the
   observed variance in annual C.tetragona growth and likely represent
   insitu summer temperatures. JulT(emx) explained 27% and was
   reconstructed back to 1927. The reconstruction showed relatively high
   growing season temperatures in the early to mid-twentieth century, as
   well as warming in recent decades. The rapid growth increase in
   C.tetragona shrubs in response to recent High Arctic summer warming
   shows that recent and future warming might promote an expansion of this
   evergreen dwarf shrub, mainly through densification of existing shrub
   patches, at High Arctic sites with sufficient winter snow cover and
   ample water supply during summer from melting snow and ice as well as
   thawing permafrost, contrasting earlier notions of limited shrub growth
   sensitivity to summer warming in the High Arctic.

AB Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean
   warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms
   such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of
   coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response
   acclimatization-mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental
   effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g.
   epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to
   offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of
   parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA
   in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9 degrees
   C, 805 mu atm P-CO2) or ambient (26.5 degrees C, 417 mu atm P-CO2)
   temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period.
   Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but
   their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when
   subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient
   conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond
   to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef
   protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects
   may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of
   stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2)
   amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on
   future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the
   potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or
   maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently
   proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid
   response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through
   parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.

AB Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) are essential for maintenance of
   plant metabolism and may be sensitive to short- and long-term climatic
   variation. NSC variation in moist tropical forests has rarely been
   studied, so regulation of NSCs in these systems is poorly understood. We
   measured foliar and branch NSC content in 23 tree species at three sites
   located across a large precipitation gradient in Panama during the
   2015-2016 El Nino to examine how short- and long-term climatic variation
   impact carbohydrate dynamics. There was no significant difference in
   total NSCs as the drought progressed (leaf P = 0.32, branch P = 0.30)
   nor across the rainfall gradient (leaf P = 0.91, branch P = 0.96).
   Foliar soluble sugars decreased while starch increased over the duration
   of the dry period, suggesting greater partitioning of NSCs to storage
   than metabolism or transport as drought progressed. There was a large
   variation across species at all sites, but total foliar NSCs were
   positively correlated with leaf mass per area, whereas branch sugars
   were positively related to leaf temperature and negatively correlated
   with daily photosynthesis and wood density. The NSC homoeostasis across
   a wide range of conditions suggests that NSCs are an allocation priority
   in moist tropical forests.

AB Loss of aerobic scope at high and low temperatures is a physiological
   mechanism proposed to limit the thermal performance and tolerance of
   organisms, a theory known as oxygenand capacity-limited thermal
   tolerance (OCLTT). Eurythermal organisms maintain aerobic scope over
   wide ranges of temperatures, but it is unknown whether acclimation is
   necessary to maintain this breadth. The objective of this study was to
   examine changes in aerobic scope in Fundulus heteroclitus, a eurythermal
   fish, after acclimation and acute exposure to temperatures from 5
   degrees to 33 degrees C. The range of temperatures over which aerobic
   scope was nonzero was similar in acclimated and acutely exposed fish,
   suggesting that acclimation has modest effects on the thermal breadth of
   aerobic scope. However, in acclimated fish, there was a clear optimum
   temperature range for aerobic scope between 25 degrees and 30 degrees C,
   whereas aerobic scope was relatively constant across the entire
   temperature range with acute temperature exposure. Therefore, the
   primary effect of acclimation was to increase aerobic scope between 25
   degrees and 30 degrees C, which paradoxically resulted in a narrower
   temperature range of optimal performance in acclimated fish compared to
   acutely exposed fish. There was only weak evidence for correlations
   between the thermal optimum of aerobic scope and the thermal optimum of
   measures of performance (specific growth rate and gonadosomatic index),
   and indicators of anaerobic metabolism (lactate accumulation and lactate
   dehydrogenase activity) only increased at high temperatures. Together
   these data fit many, but not all, of the predictions made by OCLTT.

AB Ectotherms utilise a complex array of behavioural and physiological
   mechanisms to cope with variation in suboptimal thermal environments.
   However, these mechanisms may be insufficient for population persistence
   under contemporary climate change, resulting in a greater need to
   understand how local populations respond to geographic variation in
   climate. In this study, we explored the potential for local adaptation
   and acclimation in thermal traits and behaviours using wild and captive
   populations of a small agamid lizard (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus
   muricatus). We predicted that wild lizards from a high elevation site
   would have cooler thermal preferences compared to those at low elevation
   sites to match the more restricted thermal resources at higher, cooler
   elevations. We additionally explored whether variation in thermal traits
   was due to recent acclimation or fixed population differences, such as
   due to developmental plasticity or local adaptation. In contrast to our
   predictions, we found high-elevation lizards began panting at higher
   temperatures and had higher thermal preferences relative to lower
   elevation lizards. When allowed to bask freely, there was no difference
   in the intensity of basking or daily duration of time spent basking
   between lizards from different elevations. Although the high-elevation
   lizards appeared to show stronger acclimation to recent air temperatures
   compared to low-elevation lizards, this difference was not significant.
   Similarly, captive lizards acclimated under long and short basking
   regimes showed no major differences in thermal traits or basking
   behaviour. Our results are consistent with the presence of
   counter-gradient variation in thermal phenotypes of lizards, and suggest
   that these are driven by local adaptive responses or developmental
   effects rather than recent acclimation.

AB Coffee berry borer (CBB, Hypothenemus hampei) (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is the most destructive pest of coffee
   worldwide. Information on CBB development times can be used to predict
   the initiation of new infestation cycles early in the coffee-growing
   season and thus inform the timing of insecticide applications. While
   laboratory estimates of CBB development under constant conditions exist,
   they have not been applied under the heterogeneous environmental
   conditions that characterize many coffee-growing regions. We measured
   CBB development times and abundance in commercial coffee farms across an
   elevational gradient on Hawai'i Island and applied thermal accumulation
   models from previous laboratory studies to test their fit to field data.
   Artificial lures were used to infest coffee berries at five farms
   ranging in elevation from 279-792 m, and weather variables were
   monitored at macro (farm-level) and micro (branch-level) scales. CBB
   development was followed in the field from the time of initial berry
   infestation by the founding female through the development of F1 mature
   adults. Mean development time from egg to adult across all sites was
   38.5 +/- 3.46 days, while the mean time required for the completion of a
   full life cycle (from time of infestation to presence of mature F1
   females) was 50.9 +/- 3.35 days. Development time increased with
   increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Using macroscale
   temperature data and two different estimates for the lower temperature
   threshold (14.9 degrees C and 13.9 degrees C), we estimated a mean
   requirement of 332 +/- 14 degree-days and 386 +/- 16 degree-days,
   respectively, from the time of berry infestation to the initiation of a
   new reproductive cycle in mature coffee berries. Similar estimates were
   obtained using microscale temperature data, indicating that macro-scale
   temperature monitoring is sufficient for life-cycle prediction. We also
   present a model relating elevation to number of CBB generations per
   month. Our findings suggest that CBB development times from laboratory
   studies are generally applicable to field conditions on Hawai'i Island
   and can be used as a decision support tool to improve IPM strategies for
   this worldwide pest of coffee.

AB Oceanographic conditions modulate the growth of bivalves. In Northern
   Patagonia, Argentina, seasonal thermohaline fronts define 3
   oceanographic domains in the San Matias Gulf (SMG) and the San Jose Gulf
   (SJG), which create different environmental conditions for growth. We
   studied the variability of the growth pattern in a metapopulation of the
   geoduck clam Panopea abbreviata within and between oceanographic
   domains. P. abbreviata forms spatially disjunct subpopulations in the
   SMG and the SJG. Growth patterns were determined using size-at-age data
   from counts of inner shell layers for two subpopulations in each
   oceanographic domain. We used a multimodel inference approach to
   describe the growth pattern, fitting five candidate growth models (von
   Bertalanffy, logistic, Gompertz, Richards, and Schnute-Richards). Growth
   was fast during the first 8-10 years and slowed in later years. This
   pattern was consistent with the pattern described in studies for other
   Panopea species. Larger individuals of P. abbreviata were more abundant
   in mud-sandy places (Punta Conos and Playa Fracasso, SJG's eastern
   coast) than in locations with sand sediment (Punta Colorada and Puerto
   Lobos, SMG's western coast). Multimodel inference is a robust way to
   estimate growth parameters for this species. We found differences among
   locations, independent of the domains. The results suggest that local
   environmental conditions are greater growth modulators than general
   oceanographic conditions. The differences in growth observed among
   locations should be considered when developing biological reference
   points specific for each location. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   strategies that would allow for increased wheat production under saline
   conditions to meet the increasing global demand. We used a set that
   consists of 150 internationally derived winter and facultative wheat
   cultivars genotyped with a 90K SNP chip and phenotyped for ST across
   three growth stages and for ionic (leaf K+ and Na(+)contents) traits to
   dissect the genetic architecture regulating ST in wheat. Genome-wide
   association mapping revealed 187 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs)
   (R-2 = 3.00-30.67%), representing 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL),
   significantly associated with the ST traits. Of these, four QTL on 1BS,
   2AL, 2BS and 3AL were associated with ST across the three growth stages
   and with the ionic traits. Novel QTL were also detected on 1BS and 1DL.
   Candidate genes linked to these polymorphisms were uncovered, and
   expression analyses were performed and validated on them under saline
   and non-saline conditions using transcriptomics and qRT-PCR data.
   Expressed sequence comparisons in contrasting ST wheat genotypes
   identified several non-synonymous/missense mutation sites that are
   contributory to the ST trait variations, indicating the biological
   relevance of these polymorphisms that can be exploited in breeding for
   ST in wheat.

   variability in reproductive aspects among different populations, we

   fecundity were significantly higher in specimens from Costa Rica then in
   those collected in Brazil. Embryo volume was significantly smaller in
   the Costa Rican population, and in both populations embryos doubled
   their volume during embryogenesis. We discuss and compare our findings
   with the information available regarding H. obliquimanus and other
   hippolytid shrimp. The reproductive traits of both populations of H.
   obliquimanus show some important differences which may reflect
   adaptations to local environmental conditions, demonstrating a high

AB The development of phytoplankton biomass and composition in a eutrophic
   boreal lake was studied during the evolution of under-ice convection in
   spring. The results from 8 yr showed that, within a few weeks before
   ice-break, phytoplankton biomass regularly increased by up to two or
   three orders of magnitude, reaching or exceeding the biomass in summer.
   Accordingly, this may be the most significant single annual
   phytoplankton episode in the lake. The development of phytoplankton was
   closely coupled with that of convection created by solar radiation at
   water temperatures <4 degrees C. In addition to vertical convection
   which keeps phytoplankton suspended, there was also horizontal
   convection which transported water with likely higher abundance of
   phytoplankton from the shallow lake margins. The effect of mechanical
   mixing, which was meant to prevent anoxia in the deep water layers of
   the study basin, was overridden by natural convection. Stochastic
   variations in weather played a key role controlling light penetration
   into the lake and hence the abundance and composition of under-ice
   phytoplankton. After snow melt the proportion of motile algae was at
   first higher, sometimes with a maximum nearest to the ice, but later
   diatoms flourished throughout the convection layer. Only in the years of
   the shortest convection period did the proportion of motile algae remain
   high until the end of ice cover. More detailed information about the
   interaction between littoral and pelagial water masses under different
   mixing regimes is needed for a more profound understanding of the
   development of phytoplankton under-ice.

AB In recent decades, a decrease in snowfall attributed to the effects of
   global warming (among other causes) has become evident. However, it is
   reasonable to investigate meteorological causes for such decrease, by
   analyzing changes in synoptic scale patterns. On the Iberian Peninsula,
   the Castilla y Leon region in the northwest consists of a central
   plateau surrounded by mountain ranges. This creates snowfalls that are
   considered both an important water resource and a transportation risk.
   In this work, we develop a classification of synoptic situations that
   produced important snowfalls at observation stations in the major cities
   of Castilla y Leon from 1960 to 2011. We used principal component
   analysis (PCA) and cluster techniques to define four synoptic patterns
   conducive to snowfall in the region. Once we confirmed homogeneity of
   the series and serial correlation of the snowfallday records at the

   belonging to each synoptic pattern favorable for snowfall production at
   the observatory locations.

AB We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous,
   latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by
   measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies
   reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the
   contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than
   that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size
   nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area
   itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the
   differences between the continents were caused by differences in the
   initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the
   direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite
   large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the
   latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the
   individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship
   between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same
   way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing
   area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory
   interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase
   in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular
   basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and
   natural populations along latitudinal clines.

AB Aim
   To reconstruct the last c. 7000 years of vegetation and climate change
   in an unusual region of modern Great Plains grassland and scarp woodland
   in south-east Colorado (USA), and to determine the late Holocene
   biogeography of Colorado pinon (Pinus edulis) at its easternmost extent,
   using a series of radiocarbon-dated packrat (Neotoma sp.) middens.
   Location
   The West Carrizo Canyon drains the Chaquaqua Plateau, a plateau that
   projects into the western extent of the southern Great Plains grasslands
   in south-eastern Colorado, USA. Elevations of the study sites are 1448
   to 1525 m a.s.l. Today the plateau is mostly Juniperus scopulorum-P.
   edulis woodland.
   Methods
   Plant macrofossils and pollen assemblages were analysed from 11
   14C-dated packrat middens. Ages ranged from 5990 yr bp (6839 cal. yr bp)
   to 280 yr bp (485 cal. yr bp).
   Results
   The results presented here provide information on the establishment and
   expansion of Juniperus-P. edulis woodland at its eastern limits. The
   analysis of both plant macrofossils and pollen from the 11 middens
   documents changes in plant communities over the last 7000 years, and the
   establishment of P. edulis at its easternmost limit. Though very minor
   amounts of P. edulis pollen occur as early as the middle Holocene, plant
   macrofossils were only recovered in middens dating after c. 480 cal. yr
   bp.
   Main conclusions
   Originally, midden research suggested a late glacial refuge to the
   north-east of the Carrizo Canyon site, and a middle Holocene expansion
   of P. edulis. Results reported here are consistent with a late Holocene
   expansion, here at its eastern limits, but noted elsewhere at its
   northern and north-eastern limits. In general, this late Holocene
   expansion is consistent with pollen data from sediments in Colorado and
   New Mexico, and suggests that P. edulis is still expanding its range at
   its present extremes. This has implications for further extension of its
   range due to changing climatic conditions in the future.

AB Wildfire disturbance is one of the most prevalent forces of ecological
   change in freshwater environments. Studies of stream temperature
   responses to wildfire disturbance are often limited to individual
   watersheds or burn events, resulting in an incomplete understanding of:
   1) how wildfires affect stream temperature at broader spatial scales and
   2) which environmental and pyrological factors are important predictors
   of thermal responses. We analyzed long-term temperature monitoring data
   from 18 fire-affected streams across the Pacific Northwest We used a
   nonparametric effect-size approach to quantify response patterns among
   26 metrics describing the thermal regime (magnitude, variability,
   frequency, and timing of thermal events) in the 1st postfire year. We
   used multivariate ordination and spatially explicit data on pyrological,
   hydrological, and meteorological conditions to identify potential
   drivers of thermal sensitivity to wildfire effects in disturbed
   watersheds. Thermal responses were highly variable at the site level,
   but, in general, streams of the Pacific Northwest are prone to increased
   frequency of warmer temperatures and decreased frequency of cooler
   temperatures in the year after a wildfire. Redundancy analysis showed
   that 30 to 55% of the variation in stream temperature responses was
   equally explained by pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological
   conditions. Mean annual precipitation, % watershed burned, and mean
   annual flow were primary factors shaping thermal response to wildfire,
   but the relative importance of these potential drivers varied among
   aspects of the thermal regime. Our study provides new insight into the
   regional influence of wildfire on stream thermal regimes and indicates
   that wildfire could exacerbate climate-induced warming in streams.
   Further investigation of the interactions among wildfire, hydrology, and
   climatic processes and enhanced stream network monitoring are needed to
   manage fresh waters in a future characterized by more severe and
   frequent wildfire activity.

AB The global diversity patterns of latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous
   (Tithonian-Berriasian) radiolarian faunas were analyzed based on samples
   from the European Alps, Oman, Philippines and Antarctica and an
   extensive literature survey. Several measures of diversity were applied
   to faunas from tropical (Oman, Mexico, Pacific), subtropical (Alps,
   California, Philippines, Japan), and subpolar (Antarctic Peninsula, New
   Zealand, Northern Russia) localities. Original diversity patterns are
   obscured by taxonomic, sedimentological, and preservational biases.
   Qualitative and quantitative corrections of these biases indicated a
   significant diversity gradient from tropical-subtropical to subpolar
   latitudes, but no significant difference between tropical and
   subtropical assemblages. The latitudinal diversity gradient was
   apparently asymmetrical, being steeper in the Northern Hemisphere than
   in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere the diversity
   gradient was similar to the one observed in modern radiolarian
   sedimentary assemblages. Considering the more equable climate of the
   Tithonian-Berriasian, it appears unlikely that temperature was the only
   control of the observed diversity patterns. The results substantiate the
   notion of latitudinal diversity gradients as a time-invariant feature of
   the Earth, possibly driven by gradients in biome size. (C) 2002 Elsevier

AB Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in
   seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size
   among closely-related species with similar ecologies. Understanding this
   relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more
   sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American
   plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is
   associated with species' latitudinal extents and the thermal range of
   the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal
   physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test
   and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying
   latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically-controlled Markov chain Monte
   Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to
   determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide- and
   narrow-ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In
   addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability
   of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit.
   Further, we investigated if there is a trade-off between critical
   thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm
   results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between
   wide and narrow-ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide
   latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when
   subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several
   narrow-ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also
   found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability
   and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and
   CTMax. Wide-ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for
   thermal acclimation than narrow-ranging species, suggesting that
   selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling
   geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability.
   Further, given that narrow-ranging salamanders are found to have both
   poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they
   are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated
   with anthropogenic climate change.

AB P>1. Many of the global losses of amphibians are believed to be caused
   by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Hence,
   determining its present and future environmental suitability should help
   to inform management and surveillance of this pathogen and curtail the
   amphibian biodiversity crisis.
   2. In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, Murray et al. (2010)
   offer an important step in this direction by providing a species
   distribution model that projects the environmental suitability of Bd
   across Australia and predicts locations of chytridiomycosis and
   amphibian declines. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis presence was
   predicted by diurnal temperature range (a measure of temperature
   variability) and mean precipitation. Human population density, a
   positive predictor of Bd, accounted for the most variation when removed
   from the statistical model.
   3. This work represents an invaluable case study and has great potential
   for managing chytridiomycosis and associated amphibian declines, but its
   value in practice will depend on how well managers understand the
   limitations of species distribution models.
   4.Synthesis and applications. To improve the management of
   chytridiomycosis, amphibian-chytrid research should attempt to
   understand how humans may affect the distribution of Bd, how climatic
   means and variances affect Bd transmission, how much variation in the
   distribution of Bd is unique to and shared among climate, human, and
   other factors, whether human-related factors and climate statistically
   interact, and how these potentially correlated factors and any
   interactions affect the predictability of species distribution models.
   In response to the swift spread of Bd and our rapidly changing planet,
   we encourage the application of Bd distribution models to other regions
   of the globe and predictions of Bd's distribution under future climate
   change scenarios.

AB Intertidal blue mussel beds are important for the functioning and
   community composition of coastal ecosystems. Modeling spatial dynamics
   of intertidal mussel beds is complicated because suitable habitat is
   spatially heterogeneously distributed and recruitment and loss are hard
   to predict. To get insight into the main determinants of dispersion,
   growth and loss of intertidal mussel beds, we analyzed spatial
   distributions and growth patterns in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea. We
   considered yearly distributions of adult intertidal mussel beds from 36
   connected tidal basins between 1999 and 2010 and for the period
   1968-1976. We found that in both periods the highest coverage of tidal
   flats by mussel beds occurs in the sheltered basins in the southern
   Wadden Sea. We used a stochastic growth model to investigate the effects
   of density dependence, winter temperature and storminess on changes in
   mussel bed coverage between 1999 and 2010. In contrast to expectation,
   we found no evidence that cold winters consistently induced events of
   synchronous population growth, nor did we find strong evidence for
   increased removal of adult mussel beds after stormy winter seasons.
   However, we did find synchronic growth within groups of proximate tidal
   basins and that synchrony between distant groups is mainly low or
   negative. Because the boundaries between synchronic groups are located
   near river mouths and in areas lacking suitable mussel bed habitat, we
   suggest that the metapopulation is under the control of larval dispersal
   conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of moving from simple
   habitat suitability models to models that incorporate metapopulation
   processes to understand spatial dynamics of mussel beds. The
   spatio-dynamic structure revealed in this paper will be instrumental for
   that purpose.

AB Global warming can negatively affect freshwater macrophytes. However,
   the degree to which freshwater plants can survive after long-term or
   short-term warming and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully
   understood. The aim of our study was to analyze the responses of an
   invasive plant to moderate heat stress (HS). Biochemical and
   physiological stress responses to experimental warming (30 +/- 1.0
   degrees C/25 +/- 1.0 degrees C, day/night) were assessed in the invasive
   waterweed Elodea canadensis. The effect of the moderate HS on the
   macrophyte was evaluated through changes in the total protein content,
   catalase activity, lipid peroxidation, cellular membrane permeability by
   electrolyte leakage and the concentrations of carotenoids and
   photosynthetic pigments. Catalase activity and carotenoid concentrations
   increased significantly (p<0.01) in comparison to the control. A
   significant increase (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde concentration was
   observed. However, at the same time there was a persistent low level of
   electrolyte leakage in heat-treated plants as compared to the control.
   The results demonstrated that moderate HS improved membrane stability
   and increased the concentration of photosynthetic pigments and
   antioxidant activity in E. canadensis shoots. Moderate alterations in
   temperature may favorably affect the physiology and growth of the
   invasive macrophyte E. canadensis. It is reasonable to expect that
   warming could lead to a gradual change in E. canadensis distribution and
   to changes in composition of freshwater ecosystems.

AB A few bacterial cells may be sufficient to produce a food-borne illness
   outbreak, provided that they are capable of adapting and proliferating
   on a food matrix. This is why any quantitative health risk assessment
   policy must incorporate methods to accurately predict the growth of
   bacterial populations from a small number of pathogens. In this aim,
   mathematical models have become a powerful tool. Unfortunately, at low
   cell concentrations, standard deterministic models fail to predict the
   fate of the population, essentially because the heterogeneity between
   individuals becomes relevant. In this work, a stochastic differential
   equation (SDE) model is proposed to describe variability within
   single-cell growth and division and to simulate population growth from a
   given initial number of individuals. We provide evidence of the model
   ability to explain the observed distributions of times to division,
   including the lag time produced by the adaptation to the environment, by
   comparing model predictions with experiments from the literature for
   Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, and Salmonella enterica. The model
   is shown to accurately predict experimental growth population dynamics
   for both small and large microbial populations. The use of stochastic
   models for the estimation of parameters to successfully fit experimental
   data is a particularly challenging problem. For instance, if Monte Carlo
   methods are employed to model the required distributions of times to
   division, the parameter estimation problem can become numerically
   intractable. We overcame this limitation by converting the stochastic
   description to a partial differential equation (backward Kolmogorov)
   instead, which relates to the distribution of division times. Contrary
   to previous stochastic formulations based on random parameters, the
   present model is capable of explaining the variability observed in
   populations that result from the growth of a small number of initial
   cells as well as the lack of it compared to populations initiated by a
   larger number of individuals, where the random effects become
   negligible.

AB Phytoplankton production on the Faroe Shelf varied dramatically from
   1990 to 2003 and a close empirical relationship between phytoplankton
   production and cod production is demonstrated in this study. The large
   fluctuations of the biomass of the Faroe Plateau cod stock in the 1990s
   seem to be explained by variations in primary production, i.e. by a
   fluctuating carrying capacity of the Faroe Shelf ecosystem. The causal
   mechanism seems to be a positive relationship between phytoplankton
   production, zooplankton production and production of food organisms for
   cod (e.g. benthic crustaceans and especially sandeels). The year-class
   strength of Faroe Plateau cod seems to be determined during their second
   winter, corresponding to the time when they leave the nearshore nursery
   areas and enter the feeding areas of adult cod. The regulating factor
   seems to be abundance of suitable food organisms for small cod, which
   seems to be a result of total food availability (determined by the
   phytoplankton production) and competition from older cod, i.e.
   density-dependent recruitment. The individual growth of cod older than 2
   years seems to be a result of the total food availability and the stock
   size of cod, i.e. density-dependent growth. Implications for stock
   assessment and management are discussed. (C) 2005 International Council

AB Growing networks of actin fibers are able to organize into compact,
   stiff two-dimensional structures inside lamellipodia of crawling cells.
   We put forward the hypothesis that the growing actin network is a
   critically self-organized system, in which long-range mechanical
   stresses arising from the interaction with the plasma membrane provide
   the selective pressure leading to organization. We show that a simple
   model based only on this principle reproduces the stochastic nature of
   lamellipodia protrusion (growth periods alternating with fast
   retractions) and several of the features observed in experiments: a
   growth velocity initially insensitive to the external force; the
   capability of the network to organize its orientation; a
   load-history-dependent growth velocity. Our model predicts that the
   spectrum of the time series of the height of a growing lamellipodium
   decays with the inverse of the frequency. This behavior is a well-known
   signature of self-organized criticality and is confirmed by unique
   optical tweezer measurements performed in vivo on neuronal growth cones.

AB Sudden changes in the variability of natural populations can result in
   increased likelihood of extinction or in greater frequency and intensity
   of pest outbreaks. These changes could be associated with changes in
   some relevant population parameters such as the equilibrium density or
   the maximum population growth rate. However, changes in these parameters
   have very different consequences. An increase in equilibrium density
   results in a higher variance in population fluctuations according to the
   relationship between mean and variance described by Taylor's power law,
   but does not modify the stability properties of the system. On the other
   hand, changes in the maximum growth rate induce changes in the dynamic
   regimes and stability properties of the population. In this study, using
   statistical and mathematical methods borrowed from econometrics and
   engineering, we identify structural changes to the variance in the
   population dynamics of the sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis and
   the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum in the UK. Some localities
   showed strong changes in their population parameters, such that their
   dynamic regime changed completely. These changes in the population
   dynamic regimes increase the expected frequency of outbreaks, which has
   enormous economic and ecological consequences. Through this study we
   show the application of methods that could be helpful to pest and
   wildlife managers in the task of evaluating changes in the risk of
   outbreaks or extinction of animal populations under changing global
   environmental scenarios.

AB A tenet of macroecology is that physiological processes of organisms are
   linked to large-scale geographical patterns in environmental conditions.
   Species at higher latitudes experience greater seasonal temperature
   variation and are consequently predicted to withstand greater
   temperature extremes. We tested for relationships between breadths of
   thermal tolerance in ectothermic animals and the latitude of specimen
   location using all available data, while accounting for habitat,
   hemisphere, methodological differences and taxonomic affinity. We found
   that thermal tolerance breadths generally increase with latitude, and do
   so at a greater rate in the Northern Hemisphere. In terrestrial
   ectotherms, upper thermal limits vary little while lower thermal limits
   decrease with latitude. By contrast, marine species display a coherent
   poleward decrease in both upper and lower thermal limits. Our findings
   provide comprehensive global support for hypotheses generated from
   studies at smaller taxonomic subsets and geographical scales. Our
   results further indicate differences between terrestrial and marine
   ectotherms in how thermal physiology varies with latitude that may
   relate to the degree of temperature variability experienced on land and
   in the ocean.

AB The Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia (Pisces: Atherinidae), exhibits
   an exceptionally high level of clinal variation in sex determination
   across its geographic range. Previous work suggested linear changes in
   the level of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) with
   increasing latitude. Based on comparisons at 31 sites encompassing the
   entire species' range, we find that the change in level of TSD with
   latitude is instead highly nonlinear. The level of TSD is uniformly high
   in the south (Florida to New Jersey), then declines rapidly into the
   northern Gulf of Maine where genotypic sex determination (GSD)
   predominates and then rebounds to moderate levels of TSD in the
   northern-most populations of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Major latitudinal
   breakpoints occur in central New Jersey (40(o)N) and the northern Gulf
   of Maine (44(o)N). No populations display pure TSD or GSD. Length of the
   growing season is the likely agent of selection driving variation in TSD
   with a threshold at 210 days. Because gene flow among populations is
   high, such distinct patterns of geographic variation in TSD/GSD are
   likely maintained by contemporary selection thereby demonstrating the
   adaptive fine tuning of sex determining mechanisms.

AB Parasites are ubiquitous throughout nature and can have dramatic effects
   on their hosts. Although much is known about the pathology of parasites,
   the environmental factors influencing the distribution and abundance of
   parasites are poorly understood. Investigations into these factors could
   help predict the effect of parasites on the functioning of ecosystems.
   The limpet Patella vulgata is a key grazer on European rocky shores and
   is the first intermediate host for the trematode parasite,
   Echinostephilla patellae. This study investigated the spatial
   distribution of E. patellae in relation to P. vulgata at fourteen rocky
   shores around Ireland. Despite P. vulgata recruiting into rock pools,
   adults are more abundant on emergent rock and experience greater
   mortality in pools compared to emergent rock. It has been suggested that
   greater parasite prevalence in pools may be a factor driving this
   disjunct distribution pattern. Prevalence of infection was compared
   among rock and pool habitats. Size and sex of the host were also
   investigated in order to determine whether host phenotype influenced
   levels of infection prevalence. Results varied considerably among study
   sites, probably due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. No
   clear pattern emerged in relation to infection prevalence between
   habitats but this may be owing to the low numbers of limpets collected
   from pools. There was a significant positive relationship between
   infection prevalence and increasing host size. Individuals for which sex
   was indeterminate were more likely to be infected than distinct males or
   females, suggesting that infection may be causing castration and
   subsequent removal of these individuals from the breeding population. We
   discuss the importance of considering host-parasite dynamics in a period
   of rapid environmental change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Inspired by the motility of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, we have
   experimentally studied the growth of an actin gel: around spherical
   beads grafted with ActA, a protein known to be the promoter of bacteria
   movement. On ActA-grafted beads F-actin is formed in a spherical manner,
   whereas on the bacteria a "comet-like" tail of F-actin is produced. We
   show experimentally that the stationary thickness of the gel depends On
   the radius of the beads. Moreover, the actin gel is not formed if the
   ActA surface density is too low. To interpret our results, we propose a
   theoretical model to explain how the mechanical stress (due to spherical
   geometry) limits the growth of the actin gel. Our model also takes into
   account treadmilling of actin, We deduce from our work that the force
   exerted by the actin gel on the bacteria is of the order of 10 pN.
   Finally, we estimate from our theoretical model possible conditions for
   developing actin comet tails.

AB Most animals experience periods of unfavourable conditions, challenging
   their daily energy balance. During breeding, king penguins fast
   voluntarily for up to 1.5 months in the colony, after which they
   replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might
   encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw
   from previously stored energy (e.g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing
   peripheral fat stores requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and
   thermoregulatory costs. Hence, how these birds balance the conflicting
   demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We
   investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in
   cold water by: (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue
   perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral); and (2)
   recording their oxygen consumption rate while birds floated inside a
   water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues
   often reached near-normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained
   perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in
   water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting
   duration in water, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was
   warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in
   water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater
   heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access
   subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral
   tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is
   likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing free fatty acids
   (FFA) in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing
   FFA to fuel metabolism when foraging success was insufficient.

AB Seven populations of Mesodinium pulex, some sampled from
   widely-separated coasts of the U.S.A., were examined morphometrically (5
   in some detail). Body shape and dimensions, and the external appendages,
   were studied and measured by dark phase-contrast microscopy and
   photomicrography. Some inclusions, behaviour and movement, and cell
   division were also observed. Large differences often yielding high
   significance were found between morphometric means of some populations,
   and some typical cirri numbers differed greatly. However, the ranges of
   variation formed a continuum, supporting the author's belief that all
   the investigated populations belonged to the same species, M. pulex.
   Populations were best differentiated by width of cone base, and differed
   qualitatively in cone shape, cirrus structure and the cytostome's rim.
   Surprisingly, the populations at the lowest ambient temperatures did not
   have larger body dimensions or more cirri. The endings of the 8 - 10
   tentacular processes were cone-shaped or globose. Cells vertically
   attached to the substrate in lakes of seawater rose upward at intervals.
   The extreme cone forms often observed in one population (M72) may have
   been called forth by the presence of sewage. The identifying
   characteristics of M. pulex, Mesodinium acarus and Species Ill are
   given.

   increased mean vertebral number in the northern population, intensifying
   the latitudinal trend in vertebral number that existed in the fall. The

AB Sardine, pilchard and anchovy stocks form the basis of commercially
   important purse seine fisheries in eastern boundary upwelling regions.
   High levels of environmentally driven recruitment variability have,
   however, made them especially difficult to manage. Reliable forecasts of
   recruitment success would greatly help with the setting of catch quotas
   prior to each fishing season. Theories of how environmental conditions
   influence recruitment success, according to survival/mortality of the
   early life-history stages, can be divided into mechanistic and sythesis
   theories. Mechanistic theories are concerned with specific physical
   processes, whereas synthesis theories attempt to unite the various
   mechanistic processes within a single conceptual framework. Despite the
   successful testing of some theories, there has been little success in
   reliably predicting recruitment success from a knowledge of
   environmental conditions. Possible reasons include the following:
   non-linearity in the relationship between environmental parameters and
   recruitment: the poor spatial and temporal resolution of much
   oceanographic data; the wide range of different factors involved in
   determining recruitment success; and the choice of environmental index.
   The recent compilation of time series of satellite images for these
   regions offers a solution to some of these problems, and in doing so
   reopens the possibility of finding sufficiently good relationships
   between environmental conditions and recruitment success for management
   purposes. In particular, the high resolution of these time series allows
   for the construction of environmental indices across many different
   spatial and temporal scales. These time series also open up the
   possibility of quantifying the behaviour of upwelling systems according
   to the evolution of their spatial structure through time, using pattern
   analysis techniques.

AB The protection of spawning fish from anthropogenic impacts requires
   information on the location, timing, and interannual persistence of
   spawning aggregations. In this study, generalized additive models were
   used to predict the spawning habitat of North Sea cod, based on the
   abundance of spawning fish within three population subareas and nine
   environmental layers. The length of spawning cod differed among
   population subareas, consistent with published evidence of maturation
   differences. In the northeast North Sea (Viking), the peak in the
   spawning season was estimated to occur after the survey which made the
   prediction of spawning grounds for this area less certain. Cod were
   found to prefer areas with temperatures around 5-7 degrees C for
   spawning and there was a general preference for high salinity waters.
   Persistence of cod spawning grounds over the study period was related to
   interannual stability in temperature, with high variability in the use
   of Southern Bight spawning grounds. As such, cod appear to minimize
   interannual variability in the initial environmental conditions
   affecting offspring survival by selecting suitable cold spawning
   grounds. Seabed conditions also affected spawning distribution with cod
   selecting coarse sand and avoiding areas of very high tidal flow. The
   model prediction was compared with the distribution of cod aggregations
   during the spawning season reported by fishing boats. Seventy per cent
   of the aggregations was located in areas classified as occasional or
   recurrent spawning grounds. The predicted distribution confirmed the
   widespread occurrence of spawning in the North Sea and showed good
   agreement with recent and past studies of cod egg distribution,
   suggesting that nearly all major historical areas of spawning still
   appear in use today. However, the study also found that the recent
   recovery of spawning-stock biomass was not uniform across the stock,
   being centred in the northwest subarea.

AB Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to play a
   beneficial role in hibernating mammals. High amounts of dietary PUFA led
   to an earlier hibernation onset, deeper and longer hibernation bouts and
   a higher proportion of hibernating animals in several species. In
   contrast, the relevance of dietary PUFA for daily heterotherms
   exhibiting only brief and shallow torpor bouts is less well studied.
   Therefore, diets differing in PUFA composition were used to examine the
   effects on the frequency of spontaneous daily torpor in Djungarian
   hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). In contrast to earlier studies, we were
   interested in whether the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA affects torpor
   expression, and in comparison with a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty
   acids (MUFA). Although we found a positive effect on torpor frequency in
   hamsters fed a diet rich in n-6 PUFA compared with the groups fed diets
   either rich in n-3 PUFA or MUFA, the latter two groups did not show
   unusually low torpor frequencies. The results of the additional diet
   choice experiment indicated that hamsters in short photoperiod select
   food with only a slight excess of n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA (ratio
   of 1 to 1.5). However, there was no significant difference in torpor
   frequency between the diet choice group and hamsters fed on standard
   chow with a sevenfold excess of n-6 PUFA. In summary, the present data
   strongly indicate that the dietary composition of unsaturated fatty
   acids plays a minor role in the occurrence of spontaneous daily torpor
   in Djungarian hamsters.

AB Salinity tolerance and resistance of the Pacific lion's paw scallop
   Nodipecten subnodosus, using the median lethal concentration method
   (LC50) and a gradual change method were measured. We also attempted to
   demonstrate whether salinity and temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and
   turbidity control the distribution and densities of species within a
   coastal lagoon (Laguna Ojo de Liebre, Mexico). The upper and lower LC50
   of this scallop were determined in the laboratory at predetermined times
   over 4 days (96 h) when exposing specimens to salinities of 15, 20, 25,
   30, 37, 42, 47, 50 and 60 ppt. The upper and lower salinity resistances
   were studied by subjecting the specimens to either increases or
   decreases of salinity by 3 ppt every 3 days, departing from a normal
   salinity of 37 ppt. Salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and
   turbidity of the water close to the bottom were measured once a month
   from January 2001 to March 2004 at 20 stations located along the shore
   of the lagoon. Results showed no statistical differences at the upper or
   lower LC50, at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and the species salinity tolerance
   varied from 23.5-24.2 to 50.4-53.8 ppt. Salinity resistance, measured by
   the gradual change method showed no mortality in the 22-52 ppt range,
   but abrupt mortality occurred with exposure beyond this range. Comparing
   these results with field data, we concluded that our results provide
   evidence that salinity is not a limiting factor regulating distribution
   and density of adult Pacific lion's paw scallop in the lagoon. Food
   quality and availability, water currents and substrate could be limiting
   factors.

AB Stable isotope analysis is often used to identify the geographic origins
   of migratory bird populations. While this method can accurately predict
   the provenance of migratory species, stable hydrogen isotope values
   measured in feathers (delta H-2(f)) can be variable within a site and
   may be influenced by differences among age class (second year vs. after
   second year), type of feather (primary vs. rectrix), year of sampling,
   species, and local hydrology. In this study, sources of variation in
   delta H-2(f) values were assessed in a wetland-associated Neotropical
   migratory bird, the Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), by
   comparing delta H-2(f) values among age classes, sexes, years and
   feather types in individuals breeding in eastern Virginia, USA. Age and
   year were found to influence delta H-2(f) values, with individuals in
   their second year having more depleted delta H-2(f) values (-62.43 +/-
   9.56%) than individuals older than 2 years (-53.73 +/- 9.04%).
   Differences between primaries and rectrices were within the range of
   sampling error (-2.98%), and there was no effect of sex. For
   wetland-associated songbirds, age-related differences in the dietary
   proportion of aquatic vs. terrestrial prey may provide an additional
   mechanism for differences observed in delta H-2(f) values between age
   classes. In studies that use stable isotopes to assign geographic
   feather origin, researchers should attempt to account for and propagate
   known variation in delta H-2(f) values in assignment models whenever
   possible.

AB Data that accurately capture the spatial structure of biodiversity are
   required for many paleobiological questions, from assessments of
   changing provinciality and the role of geographic ranges in extinction
   and originations, to estimates of global taxonomic or morphological
   diversity through time. Studies of temporal changes in diversity and
   global biogeographic patterns have attempted to overcome fossil sampling
   biases through sampling standardization protocols, but such approaches
   must ultimately be limited by available literature and museum
   collections. One approach to evaluating such limits is to compare
   results from the fossil record with models of past diversity patterns
   informed by modern relationships between diversity and climatic factors.
   Here we use present-day patterns for marine bivalves, combined with data
   on the geologic ages and distributions of extant taxa, to develop a
   model for Pliocene diversity patterns, which is then compared with
   diversity patterns retrieved from the literature as compiled by the
   Paleobiology Database (PaleoDB). The published Pliocene bivalve data
   (PaleoDB) lack the first-order spatial structure required to generate
   the modern biogeography within the time available (<3 Myr). Instead, the
   published data (raw and standardized) show global diversity maxima in
   the Tropical West Atlantic, followed closely by a peak in the
   cool-temperate East Atlantic. Either today's tropical West Pacific
   diversity peak, double that of any other tropical region, is a purely
   Pleistocene phenomenon-highly unlikely given the geologic ages of extant
   genera and the topology of molecular phylogenies-or the paleontological
   literature is such a distorted sample of tropical Pliocene diversity
   that current sampling standardization methods cannot compensate for
   existing biases. A rigorous understanding of large-scale spatial and
   temporal diversity patterns will require new approaches that can
   compensate for such strong bias, presumably by drawing more fully on our
   understanding of the factors that underlie the deployment of diversity
   today.

AB The long-term history of Zeiraphera diniana Gn. (the larch budmoth, LBM)
   outbreaks was reconstructed from tree rings of host subalpine larch in
   the European Alps. This record was derived from 47 513 maximum latewood
   density measurements, and highlights the impact of contemporary climate
   change on ecological disturbance regimes. With over 1000 generations
   represented, this is the longest annually resolved record of herbivore
   population dynamics, and our analysis demonstrates that remarkably
   regular LBM fluctuations persisted over the past 1173 years with
   population peaks averaging every 9.3 years. These regular abundance
   oscillations recurred until 1981, with the absence of peak events during
   recent decades. Comparison with an annually resolved, millennium-long
   temperature reconstruction representative for the European Alps (r=0.72,
   correlation with instrumental data) demonstrates that regular insect
   population cycles continued despite major climatic changes related to
   warming during medieval times and cooling during the Little Ice Age. The
   late twentieth century absence of LBM outbreaks, however, corresponds to
   a period of regional warmth that is exceptional with respect to the last
   1000+ years, suggesting vulnerability of an otherwise stable ecological
   system in a warming environment.

AB Microtubules are supramolecular structures that make up the cytoskeleton
   and strongly affect the mechanical properties of the cell. Within the
   cytoskeleton filaments, the microtubule (MT) exhibits by far the highest
   bending stiffness. Bending stiffness depends on the mechanical
   properties and intermolecular interactions of the tubulin dimers (the MT
   building blocks). Computational molecular modeling has the potential for
   obtaining quantitative insights into this area. However, to our
   knowledge, standard molecular modeling techniques, such as molecular
   dynamics (MD) and normal mode analysis (NMA), are not yet able to
   simulate large molecular structures like the MTs; in fact, their
   possibilities are normally limited to much smaller protein complexes. In
   this work, we developed a multiscale approach by merging the modeling
   contribution from MD and NMA. In particular, MD simulations were used to
   refine the molecular conformation and arrangement of the tubulin dimers
   inside the MT lattice. Subsequently, NMA was used to investigate the
   vibrational properties of MTs modeled as an elastic network. The
   coarse-grain model here developed can describe systems of hundreds of
   interacting tubulin monomers (corresponding to up to 1,000,000 atoms).
   In particular, we were able to simulate coarse-grain models of entire
   MTs, with lengths up to 350 nm. A quantitative mechanical investigation
   was performed; from the bending and stretching modes, we estimated MT
   macroscopic properties such as bending stiffness, Young modulus, and
   persistence length, thus allowing a direct comparison with experimental
   data.

AB Noise in environmental variables is often described as 'coloured', where
   colour describes the exponent beta of the scaling relationship between
   the amplitude of variability and its frequency of occurrence
   (1/f(beta)). Different environments are known to have different colours
   and models have shown that colour can have important impacts upon
   population persistence and dynamics. This study advances current
   knowledge about the impact of environmental colour using a trophic model
   (consumer-resource) experiencing environmental noise (temperature) in a
   biologically realistic manner-derived mechanistically from metabolic
   scaling theory. The model demonstrates that the variability of consumers
   and resources can respond differently to changing environmental colour,
   depending upon (i) their relative ability to track and over or
   undercompensate for environmental changes and (ii) the relative
   sensitivity of their equilibria to environmental changes. These results
   form the basis with which to interpret differences and facilitate
   comparisons of the variability of ecological communities across
   gradients of environmental colour. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Three types of surface tensions can be defined for lipid membranes: the
   internal tension, sigma, conjugated to the real membrane area in the
   Hamiltonian, the mechanical frame tension, tau, conjugated to the
   projected area, and the "fluctuation tension", r, obtained from the
   fluctuation spectrum of the membrane height. We investigate these
   surface tensions by means of a Monge gauge lattice Monte Carlo
   simulation involving the exact, nonlinear, Helfrich Hamiltonian and a
   measure correction for the excess entropy of the Monge gauge. Our
   results for the relation between s and t agrees well with the
   theoretical prediction of [J.-B. Fournier and C. Barbetta, Phys. Rev.
   Lett., 2008, 100, 078103] based on a Gaussian approximation. This
   provides a valuable knowledge of t in the standard Gaussian models where
   the tension is controlled by s. However, contrary to the conjecture in
   the above paper, we find that r exhibits no significant difference from
   t over more than five decades of tension. Our results appear to be valid
   in the thermodynamic limit and are robust to changing the ensemble in
   which the membrane area is controlled.

AB Background: The adaptive evolution of species response to environment
   are the key issues in molecular ecology and evolutionary biology. The
   direction of adaptive differentiation of species in regions lacking
   strong selection pressure is usually diverse. However, the driving
   mechanism of the diverse adaptive differentiation for regional species
   is still undetermined to date. In this study, we used landscape genomics
   modelling to infer the adaptive evolution of Cotinus coggygria in
   China's warm-temperate zone.
   Results: Using fifteen natural populations and nine start codon targeted
   (SCoT) markers, a total of 1131 unambiguous loci were yielded. Our
   results showed two genetic groups existed in the fifteen natural
   populations of C. coggygria, which is due to the divergent selection
   driven by six environmental factors. Environmental association analyses
   revealed the environmental variables related to precipitation were
   associated with high numbers of environment-associated loci.
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that the ecological characters of C.
   coggygria, i.e. avoiding wetness and tolerating drought, determine its
   adaptive evolution. This study provides a reference that ecological
   character determines the adaptive evolution of species in regions
   lacking strong selection pressure.

AB Present work focussed on improving the description of organogenesis,
   morphogenesis and metabolism in a biophysical plant model (SUNFLO)
   applied to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). This first version of the
   model is designed for potential growth conditions without any abiotic or
   biotic stresses. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to identify and
   estimate the phenotypic traits involved in plant productivity
   variability of 26 sunflower genotypes. The ability of SUNFLO to
   discriminate the genotypes was tested on previous results of a field
   survey aimed at evaluating the genetic progress since 1960. Plants were
   phenotyped in four directions; phenology, architecture, photosynthesis
   and biomass allocation. Twelve genotypic parameters were chosen to
   account for the phenotypic variability. SUNFLO was built to evaluate
   their respective contribution to the variability of yield potential. A
   large phenotypic variability was found for all genotypic parameters.
   SUNFLO was able to account for 80% of observed variability in yield
   potential and to analyse the phenotypic variability of complex plant
   traits such as light interception efficiency or seed yield. It suggested
   that several ways are possible to reach high yields in sunflower. Unlike
   classical statistical analysis, this modelling approach highlights some
   efficient parameter combinations used by the most productive genotypes.
   The next steps will be to evaluate the genetic determinisms of the
   genotypic parameters.

AB Clines in life history traits, presumably driven by spatially varying
   selection, are widespread. Major latitudinal clines have been observed,
   for example, in Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect
   from Africa that has colonized temperate habitats on multiple
   continents. Yet, how geographic factors other than latitude, such as
   altitude or longitude, affect life history in this species remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, most previous work has been performed on
   derived European, American and Australian populations, but whether life
   history also varies predictably with geography in the ancestral
   Afro-tropical range has not been investigated systematically. Here, we
   have examined life history variation among populations of D.melanogaster
   from sub-Saharan Africa. Viability and reproductive diapause did not
   vary with geography, but body size increased with altitude, latitude and
   longitude. Early fecundity covaried positively with altitude and
   latitude, whereas lifespan showed the opposite trend. Examination of
   genetic variance-covariance matrices revealed geographic differentiation
   also in trade-off structure, and Q(ST)-F-ST analysis showed that life
   history differentiation among populations is likely shaped by selection.
   Together, our results suggest that geographic and/or climatic factors
   drive adaptive phenotypic differentiation among ancestral African
   populations and confirm the widely held notion that latitude and
   altitude represent parallel gradients.

AB The reproductive stages of the life cycle are crucial in explaining the
   distribution patterns of plant species because of their extreme
   vulnerability to environmental conditions. Despite reported evidence
   that seed germination is related to habitat macroclimatic
   characteristics, such as mean annual temperature, the effect of this
   trait in controlling plant species distribution has not yet been
   systematically and quantitatively evaluated. To learn whether seed
   germination can predict species distribution along altitude gradients,
   we examined germination data of 36 Rhododendron species in southeastern
   Tibet originating from contrasting altitudes, habitats, plant heights,
   seed masses, and phylogenies. Germination varied significantly with
   altitude, habitat, plant height, and phylogeny and was higher in the
   light than in the dark. Germination percentage was highest at 10:20
   degrees C in the light and 15:25 degrees C in the dark. As altitude
   increased, germination percentages first rose and then decreased, being
   highest at 3,500-4,000m. Germination percentage and rate were highest on
   rocky slopes, increasing as seed mass and plant height rose. Variations
   in germination percentage and rate were not significant at subgenera,
   section, and subsection levels, but they were significant at species
   level. The results suggested that the relationship between germination
   and altitude may provide insights into species distribution patterns.
   Further, germination patterns are a result of long-term evolution as
   well as taxonomic constraints.

AB An improved understanding of mosquito population dynamics under natural
   environmental forcing requires adequate field observations spanning the
   full range of temporal scales over which mosquito abundance fluctuates
   in natural conditions. Here we analyze a 9-year daily time series of
   uninterrupted observations of adult mosquito abundance for multiple
   mosquito species in North Carolina to identify characteristic scales of
   temporal variability, the processes generating them, and the
   representativeness of observations at different sampling resolutions. We
   focus in particular on Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura and, using a
   combination of spectral analysis and modeling, we find significant
   population fluctuations with characteristic periodicity between 2 days
   and several years. Population dynamical modelling suggests that the
   observed fast fluctuations scales (2 days-weeks) are importantly
   affected by a varying mosquito activity in response to rapid changes in
   meteorological conditions, a process neglected in most representations
   of mosquito population dynamics. We further suggest that the range of
   time scales over which adult mosquito population variability takes place
   can be divided into three main parts. At small time scales (indicatively
   2 days-1 month) observed population fluctuations are mainly driven by
   behavioral responses to rapid changes in weather conditions. At
   intermediate scales (1 to several month) environmentally-forced
   fluctuations in generation times, mortality rates, and density
   dependence determine the population characteristic response times. At
   longer scales (annual to multi-annual) mosquito populations follow
   seasonal and inter-annual environmental changes. We conclude that
   observations of adult mosquito populations should be based on a
   sub-weekly sampling frequency and that predictive models of mosquito
   abundance must include behavioral dynamics to separate the effects of a
   varying mosquito activity from actual changes in the abundance of the
   underlying population.

AB The history of late Holocene glacier fluctuations in eastern Tibet was

   Maximum tree ages yield minimum ages of AD 1760 and 1780 for moraine
   formation at the maximum extent of the 'Little Ice Age' glacier advances
   in two glacier forefields. Subsequent moraines could be dated to the
   beginning of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century.
   Larch trees from a third glacier forefield in southeastern Tibet show
   evidence of glacier activity from 1580 to 1590, from the end of the
   eighteenth to the beginning of the nineteenth century and from 1860 to
   1880. One glacier at Mt Gyalaperi recently advanced in both 1951 and
   1987. Periods of glacier advances can partly be correlated with periods
   of growth reductions in chronologies of total ring width and maximum
   latewood density derived from trees growing on slopes above the glacier
   valleys. Correlation functions with meteorological data suggest that
   maximum latewood density of subalpine Picea balfouriana, Larix
   griffithii and Abies delavayi var. motouensis is positively correlated
   with summer temperature, while ring width of these species and of

AB Methanogens and methanotrophs play unique roles as producers and
   consumers of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in soils, respectively.
   Here, we aimed to reveal whether and to which extent methane-cyclers
   occur in high-alpine soils, and to assess their spatial distribution
   along an altitudinal gradient (2700-3500 m) in the Austrian Alps at
   sites located within the alpine (2700-2900 m), the alpine-nival
   (3000-3100 m) and the nival belts (3200-3500 m). Methanococcales and
   Methanocella spp. were most abundant among all quantified methanogenic
   guilds, whereas Methanosarcinales were not detected in the studied soil.
   The detected methanogens seem to be capable of persisting despite a
   highly oxic low-temperature environment. Methanogenic and methanotrophic
   activities and abundances of methanotrophs, Methanococcales and
   Methanocella spp. declined with altitude. Methanogenic and
   methanotrophic abundances were best explained by mean annual soil
   temperature and dissolved organic carbon, respectively. Alpine belt
   soils harbored significantly more methane-cyclers than those of the

AB Incubation is a vital component of reproduction and parental care in
   birds. Maintaining temperatures within a narrow range is necessary for
   embryonic development and hatching of young, and exposure to both high
   and low temperatures can be lethal to embryos. Although it is widely
   recognized that temperature is important for hatching success, little is
   known about how variation in incubation temperature influences the
   post-hatching phenotypes of avian offspring. However, among reptiles it
   is well known that incubation temperature affects many phenotypic traits
   of offspring with implications for their future survival and
   reproduction. Although most birds, unlike reptiles, physically incubate
   their eggs, and thus behaviourally control nest temperatures, variation
   in temperature that influences embryonic development still occurs among
   nests within a population. Recent research in birds has primarily been
   limited to populations of megapodes and waterfowl; in each group,
   incubation temperature has substantial effects on hatchling phenotypic
   traits important for future development, survival, and reproduction.
   Such observations suggest that incubation temperature (and incubation
   behaviours of parents) is an important but underappreciated parental
   effect in birds and may represent a selective force instrumental in
   shaping avian reproductive ecology and life-history traits. However,
   much more research is needed to understand how pervasive phenotypic
   effects of incubation temperature are among birds, the sources of
   variation in incubation temperature, and how effects on phenotype arise.
   Such insights will not only provide foundational information regarding
   avian evolution and ecology, but also contribute to avian conservation.

AB Biotic interactions affect species distributions, and environmental
   factors that influence these interactions can play a key role when range
   shifts in response to environmental change are modelled. In a field
   experiment using enclosures, we studied the effects of the thermal
   habitat on intra- versus inter-specific competition of juvenile Dolly
   Varden Salvelinus malma and white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis,
   as measured by differences in specific growth rates during summer in
   allopatric and sympatric treatments. Previous laboratory experiments
   have shown mixed results regarding the importance of
   temperature-dependent competitive abilities as a main driver for spatial
   segregation in stream fishes, and no study so far has confirmed its
   existence in natural streams. Under natural conditions in areas where
   the two species occur in sympatry, Dolly Varden dominate spring-fed
   tributaries (cold, stable thermal regime), whereas both species often
   coexist in non-spring-fed tributaries (warm, unstable thermal regime).
   Enclosures (charr density = 6 per m(2)) were placed in non-spring-fed
   (10-14 degrees C) and spring-fed (7-8 degrees C) tributaries. In
   enclosures placed in non-spring-fed tributaries, Dolly Varden grew 0.81%
   per day in allopatry and had negative growth (-0.33% per day) in
   sympatry, whereas growth rates were similar in allopatry and sympatry in
   spring-fed tributaries (0.68 and 0.58% per day). White-spotted charr
   grew better in sympatry than in allopatry in both thermal habitats. In
   non-spring-fed tributaries, they grew 0.17 and 0.79% per day and in
   spring-fed tributaries 0.46 and 0.75% per day in allopatry and sympatry,
   respectively. The negative effect of inter-specific competition from
   white-spotted charr on Dolly Varden thus depended on the thermal
   habitat. However, there was no strong evidence of a
   temperature-dependent effect of intra- and inter-specific competition on
   white-spotted charr growth. Multiple factors may shape species
   distribution patterns, and we show that temperature may mediate
   competitive outcomes and thus coexistence in stream fish. These effects
   of temperature will be important to incorporate into mechanistic and
   dynamic species distribution models.

AB After being extirpated from the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE), striped bass
   (Morone saxatilis) were reintroduced in 2002, and by 2008 they were
   naturally reproducing. The increase of this reintroduced population
   prompted the need to document its nursery habitats utilization, which
   contribute to species recruitment. We analysed mortality-dispersion
   rates and the growth of larvae and juveniles in relation to their
   occurrence and migration patterns. From June to September 2014, we
   collected striped bass distributed in four estuarine habitats: the
   upstream freshwater section (UP), the oligohaline (O-ETM) and the
   mesohaline (M-ETM) estuarine turbidity maximum zone, and the downstream
   polyhaline section (DOWN). Based on otolith microstructure and
   microchemistry, 305 back-calculated growth and 36 migration trajectories
   have been reconstructed. The UP and the O-ETM provided optimal
   conditions wherein which larvae and juveniles exhibited fastest growth.
   In the SLE, we emphasized the co-existence of a freshwater resident
   contingent and two migrant contingents to the M-ETM and DOWN. We propose
   that migrants adopt an adaptive migration behaviour to avoid suboptimal
   conditions and strong intraspecific competition from resident in the
   upstream habitats. The potential advantage of a downstream migration
   later in the season might be an adaptative strategy to promote their
   survival during the early life stages.

AB The Southern Ocean archipelago, the South Orkney Islands (SOI), became
   the world's first entirely high seas marine protected area (MPA) in
   2010. The SOI continental shelf (similar to 44000km(2)), was less than
   half covered by grounded ice sheet during glaciations, is biologically
   rich and a key area of both sea surface warming and sea-ice losses.
   Little was known of the carbon cycle there, but recent work showed it
   was a very important site of carbon immobilization (net annual carbon
   accumulation) by benthos, one of the few demonstrable negative feedbacks
   to climate change. Carbon immobilization by SOI bryozoans was higher,
   per species, unit area and ice-free day, than anywhere-else polar. Here,
   we investigate why carbon immobilization has been so high at SOI, and
   whether this is due to high density, longevity or high annual production
   in six study species of bryozoans (benthic suspension feeders). We
   compared benthic carbon immobilization across major regions around West
   Antarctica with sea-ice and primary production, from remotely sensed and
   directly sampled sources. Lowest carbon immobilization was at the
   northernmost study regions (South Georgia) and southernmost Amundsen
   Sea. However, data standardized for age and density showed that only SOI
   was anomalous (high). High immobilization at SOI was due to very high
   annual production of bryozoans (rather than high densities or
   longevity), which were 2x, 3x and 5x higher than on the Bellingshausen,
   South Georgia and Amundsen shelves, respectively. We found that carbon
   immobilization correlated to the duration (but not peak or integrated
   biomass) of phytoplankton blooms, both in directly sampled, local scale
   data and across regions using remote-sensed data. The long bloom at SOI
   seems to drive considerable carbon immobilization, but sea-ice losses
   across West Antarctica mean that significant carbon sinks and negative
   feedbacks to climate change could also develop in the Bellingshausen and
   Amundsen seas.

AB Actin polymerization is responsible for moving a wide variety of loads,
   from the protrusion of membrane-bound filopodia and lamellipodia of
   immune, cancer, and other motile cells, to the propulsion of some
   intracellular pathogens. A universal explanation of the forces and
   velocities generated by these systems has been hampered by a lack of
   understanding in how a population of independent filaments pushes these
   loads. Protrusion of a lamellipodium by the very filaments supporting
   the membrane load is thought to operate by the Brownian ratchet
   mechanism, with overall organization governed by the
   dendritic-nucleation/array-treadmilling model. We have incorporated
   these two models into a two-dimensional, stochastic computer model of
   lamellipodial protrusion, and studied how force and velocity generation
   varied under different assumptions. Performance is very sensitive to the
   extent to which the work of protrusion is shared among individual
   polymerization events within the filament population. Three identified
   mechanisms promote this "work-sharing": 1), Most systems, including
   lamellipodia, utilize a self-organizing distribution of filament-load
   distances which serves to decrease the effective size of a monomer and
   dramatically improve performance. 2), A flexible membrane allows for
   consistent performance over wide leading edges. 3), Finally, very
   flexible filaments are capable of sharing work very uniformly, and
   therefore, of near-perfect theoretical performance. Transient tethering
   to the lamellipodial membrane limits their efficacy, however, and
   mandates a minimum filament stiffness. Overall, we estimate lamellipodia
   to operate with 40-nm bending-length filaments and low characteristic
   tether forces. Modeled lamellipodia exhibit sigmoidal force-velocity
   relationships and share the work of protrusion only moderately well
   among filaments, performing at approximately one-half of theoretical
   force and velocity maximums. At this level of work-sharing, the natural
   monomer size is optimal for generating velocity.

AB Dependence of monoterpenoid emission and fractional composition on
   stomatal conductance (G(V)) was studied in Mediterranean conifer Pinus
   pinea, which primarily emits limonene and trans-beta-ocimene but also
   large fractions of oxygenated monoterpenoids linalool and 1,8-cineole.
   Strong decreases in G(V) attributable to diurnal water stress were
   accompanied by a significant reduction in total monoterpenoid emission
   rate in midday. However, various monoterpenoids responded differently to
   the reduction in G(V), with the emission rates of limonene and
   trans-beta-ocimene being unaffected but those of linalool and
   1,8-cineole closely following diurnal variability in G(V). A dynamic
   emission model indicated that stomatal sensitivity of emissions was
   associated with monoterpenoid Henry's law constant (H, gas/liquid phase
   partition coefficient). Monoterpenoids with a large H such as
   trans-beta-ocimene sustain higher intercellular partial pressure for a
   certain liquid phase concentration, and stomatal closure is balanced by
   a nearly immediate increase in monoterpene diffusion gradient from
   intercellular air-space to ambient air. The partial pressure rises also
   in compounds with a low H, but more than 1,000-fold higher liquid phase
   concentrations of linalool and 1,8-cineole are necessary to increase
   intercellular partial pressure high enough to balance stomatal closure.
   The system response is accordingly slower, and the emission rates may be
   transiently suppressed by low G(V). Simulations further suggested that
   linalool and 1,8-cineole synthesis rates also decreased with decreasing
   G(V), possibly as the result of selective inhibition of various
   monoterpene synthases by stomata. We conclude that physicochemical
   characteristics of volatiles not only affect total emission but also
   alter the fractional composition of emitted monoterpenoids.

AB The relationship between thermal tolerance and environmental conditions
   has been extensively studied in Drosophila. However, comparisons of
   thermal tolerance of laboratory-bred flies derived from distinct
   geographic locations have produced puzzling results. We studied the
   differential expression of heat shock protein (HSP) after heat (34
   degrees C) and cold (-4 degrees C) temperature treatments in two species
   of Drosophila flies, with distinct biogeographic origins (tropical = D.
   melanogaster and Andean = D. gaucha), previously exposed to sublethal
   acclimation temperatures (10,20 and 30 degrees C). Also we evaluated the
   relationship between thermal acclimation and survival value as a proxy
   of fitness. We found a positive relationship between thermotolerance and
   the patterns of hsp90 transcript expression in both species.
   Nevertheless, in the cases in which hsp90 mRNA expression does not match
   thermotolerance induction, the biogeographic origin of the species could
   explain such mismatches. Survival at upper and lower experimental
   temperatures were also related with species origin. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Processes acting at the level of the mitochondria have been suggested to
   affect the thermal limits of organisms. To determine whether changes in
   mitochondrial properties could underlie shifts in thermal limits, we
   examined how mitochondrial properties are affected by thermal
   acclimation in the eurythermal killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus - a
   species with substantial plasticity in whole-organism thermal limits. We
   hypothesized that thermal acclimation would result in functional changes
   in the mitochondria that could result in trade-offs in function during
   acute thermal shifts. We measured the mitochondrial respiration rate
   ((V)over dot(O2)) through multiple complexes of the electron transport
   system following thermal acclimation (to 5, 15, 33 degrees C) and
   assessed maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta p) and
   rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as an estimate of
   costs. Acclimation to 5 degrees C resulted in a modest compensation of
   mitochondrial respiration at low temperatures, but these mitochondria
   were able to maintain Delta p with acute exposure to high temperatures,
   and ROS production did not differ between acclimation groups, suggesting
   that these increases in mitochondrial capacity do not alter
   mitochondrial thermal sensitivity. Acclimation to 33 degrees C
   suppressed mitochondrial respiration as a result of effects on NADH
   dehydrogenase (complex I). These high-temperature acclimated fish
   nonetheless maintained levels of Delta p and ROS production similar to
   those of the other acclimation groups. This work demonstrates that
   killifish mitochondria can successfully acclimate to a wide range of
   temperatures without incurring major functional trade-offs during acute
   thermal shifts and that high-temperature acclimation results in a
   suppression of metabolism, consistent with patterns observed at the
   organismal level.

AB Seedling establishment is critical to profitable and sustainable
   production from small-seeded crops. A programme of work is reported that
   identifies key seed vigour traits that are required for predictable
   seedling establishment followed by a quantitative genetic analysis to
   identify loci that influence them. The three key traits were: (1) rapid
   germination; (2) rapid initial downward growth of the seedling; and (3)
   a high potential for upward shoot growth in soil of increasing
   impedance. All three traits reduce the time between sowing and seedling
   emergence when the seed bed can be deteriorating. This suggests a
   strategy of stress avoidance, through rapid progress when adequate
   moisture is present, rather than reliance on stress tolerance. B.
   oleracea doubled haploid mapping populations were screened for these
   traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. These QTL were
   then subsequently fine-mapped where possible. We report on the outcome
   of this work and discuss the results in the context of other QTL
   studies. A way forward for marker and candidate gene identification is
   then outlined that uses a translational approach to exploit the
   colinearity that exists between B. oleracea and the model plant

   five CDC-type suction traps (without light) baited with CO, at a

   greatest during late summer and early fall and was directly correlated
   with mean monthly air temperature. Parity of females was lowest during
   late summer and early fall. The gonotrophic cycle was estimated to
   require 3-4 d during hot summer months and up to 14 d during cool winter
   months. Estimated extrinsic incubation of bluetongue virus (BLU) was
   9-10 d during August and September. The estimated daily survival ranged
   from <60% in the summer to >95% in the winter, resulting in an
   expectation of life of only 2-3 d in summer and >10 d in winter. The
   probability of females surviving the extrinsic incubation period for BLU
   virus, and the expectation of infective life were both lowest during
   late summer and early Fail. During 1997, midge abundance during late
   summer was not high enough to overcome very low survivorship, and the
   absolute number of females expected to survive the extrinsic incubation
   period. was relatively low. However, in 1995 and 1996, very high midge
   abundance compensated for low survivorship during summer and the number
   of females expected to survive the extrinsic incubation period was
   relatively high. Although abundance was generally very low during the
   cool winter and spring, host-seeking females were captured throughout
   the year, and their winter survival was high. Overwintering of BLU virus
   by continued transmission of the virus by active midges appears
   possible.

AB So far mainly spores or other "differentiated-for-survival" structures
   were considered to be resistant against extreme environmental
   constraints (including extraterrestrial challenges). Microcolonial fungi
   (MCF) are unique growth structures formed by eukaryotic microorganisms
   inhabiting rock varnish surfaces in terrestrial deserts. They are here
   proposed as a new object for exobiological study. Sun-exposed desert
   rocks provide surface habitats with intense solar radiation, a scarce
   water supply, drastic changes in temperature, and episodic to sporadic
   availability of nutrients. These challenging conditions reduce the
   diversity of life to MCF, whose resistance to desiccation and tolerance
   for ultraviolet (UV) radiation make them survival specialists. Based
   upon our studies of MCF, we propose that the following mechanisms are
   universally employed for survival on rock surfaces: (1) compact
   tissue-like colony organization formed by thermodynamically optimal
   round cells embedded in extracellular polymeric substances, (2) the
   presence of several types of UV-absorbing compounds (melanins and
   mycosporines) and antioxidants (carotenoids, melanins, and mycosporines)
   that convey multiple stress resistance to desiccation, temperature, and
   irradiation changes, and (3) intracellular developmental mechanisms
   typical for these structures.

   relationship between sex ratio and constant incubation temperature is
   characterized by two parameters: the pivotal temperature (T-piv) and the
   transitional range of temperature (TRT) that produces both sexes.
   Species with variation in either of these parameters should have more
   potential to adapt to new climatic conditions, therefore putting them at
   lower risk to global warming. In this study, we incubated eggs of the
   turtle Podocnemis lewyana (Testudines: Podocnemididae) from two
   geographically isolated populations (Magdalena and Sinu rivers) under
   controlled microclimatic conditions to corroborate the TSD pattern
   previously reported for this species and to estimate the degree of
   inter-and intrapopulation variation in T-piv and TRT. We used these
   estimates, together with information found in the literature on other
   life history traits of P. lewyana, to evaluate its adaptive potential or
   vulnerability to climate change. We found interpopulation variation in
   TRT and intrapopulation variation in T-piv. This latter parameter
   exhibited a high broad-sense heritability, demonstrating this species'
   potential to adapt to climate change; however, when considering the
   narrow TRT found in this study, the species' equatorial distribution and
   related adaptations to relatively more stable climates, its fragmented
   populations and low vagility that prevent gene flow, and its low genetic
   variability, we concluded that the ability of P. lewyana to adapt to
   climate change is limited.

AB Background: The relationship between mosquito development and
   temperature is one of the keys to understanding the current and future
   dynamics and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Many
   process-based models use mean air temperature to estimate larval
   development times, and hence adult vector densities and/or malaria risk.
   Methods: Water temperatures in three different-sized water pools, as
   well as the adjacent air temperature in lowland and highland sites in
   western Kenya were monitored. Both air and water temperatures were fed
   into a widely-applied temperature-dependent development model for
   Anopheles gambiae immatures, and subsequently their impact on predicted
   vector abundance was assessed.
   Results: Mean water temperature in typical mosquito breeding sites was
   4-6 degrees C higher than the mean temperature of the adjacent air,
   resulting in larval development rates, and hence population growth
   rates, that are much higher than predicted based on air temperature. On
   the other hand, due to the non-linearities in the relationship between
   temperature and larval development rate, together with a marginal
   buffering in the increase in water temperature compared with air
   temperature, the relative increases in larval development rates
   predicted due to climate change are substantially less.
   Conclusions: Existing models will tend to underestimate mosquito
   population growth under current conditions, and may overestimate
   relative increases in population growth under future climate change.
   These results highlight the need for better integration of biological
   and environmental information at the scale relevant to mosquito biology.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate haematological responses in Red
   Sokoto goats (RSGs) administered with L-glutamine during the hot-dry
   season. Experimental animals included 28 clinically healthy RSGs divided
   into treated group (n = 14); each administered L-glutamine at 0.2 g/kg
   body weight, dissolved in 10 mL distilled water, and control group (n =
   14); each administered 10 mL distilled water, per os once daily for 21
   days. The ambient temperature and relative humidity recorded daily for 4
   weeks were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index. Three
   millilitres of blood sample was collected from each goat by jugular
   venipuncture for haematology, while rectal temperature (RT), heart rate
   (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) were also measured once weekly at weeks 0
   (before), 1, 2, 3 (during) and 4 (after L-glutamine administration). The
   haematological, RT, HR and RR data obtained weekly were analysed using
   repeated-measures one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to
   evaluate differences between periods, and between treated and control
   groups. The PCV, haemoglobin concentration and RBC count were higher (P
   < 0.05) in the treated group compared to the control group during the
   period of L-glutamine administration. These differences were sustained
   till week 4. Beginning from week 1 of the study, the total leucocyte
   count in treated group (10.10 +/- 0.25 x 10(3)/mu L) was higher (P <
   0.05) than the count in control group (7.23 +/- 0.41 x 10(3)/mu L), this
   trend was also maintained throughout the study. The
   neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio during weeks 3 and 4 of the experiment was
   lower (P < 0.05) in the treated compared to the control group. RT was
   lower (P < 0.05) in treated group than the control group. In conclusion,
   L-glutamine administration ameliorated the adverse effects of heat
   stress on the haematological parameters in RSGs during the hot-dry
   season.

AB Aim: Phenology is a key factor in explaining the distribution and
   diversity of current vineyards in France. This work has the objective to
   summarize the different studies developed in France to analyze grapevine
   phenology.
   Methods and results: Several topics are presented: a general description
   of all historical databases and observatory networks developed in France
   during the last 70 years; an overview of the different models developed
   to calculate the main phenological stages; an analysis of the main
   results obtained using these models in the context of studies of climate
   change impacts on viticulture in France; and finally a general
   discussion about the main strategies to adapt the phenological cycle to
   future climate conditions.
   Conclusion: This review emphasizes that even if phenology is not the
   only trait to be considered for adapting grapevine to climate change, it
   plays a major role in the distribution of the current variety x vineyard
   associations.
   Significance and impact of the study: It is therefore critical to
   continue to study phenology in order to better understand its
   physiological and genetic basis and to define the best strategies to
   adapt to future climatic conditions.

AB Forest health status is negatively influenced by climate change, air
   pollution and other disturbances. Extreme droughts reduce stand
   productivity, increase vulnerability to pests, and can even provoke
   mortality. Growth dynamics at tree and forest stand levels are
   considered the main indicators of stability and productivity in forest
   ecosystem structures. The main climate drivers for tree growth were
   identified using basal area increment (BAI) as a synthetic indicator.
   BAI chronologies were obtained from increment cores for 1960-2012
   period. Six species were analysed in an attempt to identify their growth
   limiting factors. For the most important oak species in Romania,
   resilience components were computed in order to analyse their response
   to drought events. Moreover, growth dynamics were analysed for two
   species in mixed and monoculture forests. The results suggest that - in
   comparison to Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica, the sensitivity of
   Quercus spp. is much higher (0.3-0.47). Oakspecies situated in the most
   drought-affected areas are sensitive to rainfall values from the
   previous autumn, current spring, and early summer, with April monthly
   values having the most significant effect on BAI increment (r = 0.47*)
   The most sensitive species to drought is Q. cerris and Q.jruinetto.
   Their BAI reduction during drought is >50% compared with the BAI values
   before the drought period. The recovery capacity of tree growth
   following drought events is lower for Q. robur and Q. petraea and higher
   for Q. cerris and Q.frainetto. The mixed forest stands have not showed a
   constant higher resistance to drought. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB One way to understand ecological patterns of species is to determine
   their physiological diversity on a large geographic and/or temporal
   scales, in a context of hierarchical biodiversity framework. In
   particular, macrophysiological studies analyze how environmental factors
   affect the physiology and therefore the distribution of species.
   Subterranean species are an excellent model for evaluating the
   large-scale effects of ambient temperature (T-a) conditions on thermal
   physiology and distribution, due to their extensive use of burrows that
   provide a relatively thermal stable environment. Species belonging to
   the genus Ctenomys are all subterranean and endemic of South America.
   Cold induced maximum metabolic rate (MMR), basal metabolic rate (BMR)
   and non shivering thermogenesis (NST) were analyzed, as well as the
   expression of uncoupled proteins (UCP) in brown adipose tissue (BAT).
   Biogeographical variables appear to have no effect MMR experimentally
   induced by cold condition within Ctenomys. Also, mechanisms of heat
   production are species-specific, varying from a combination of ST and
   NST to a complete use of shivering mechanisms. This pattern is
   correlated at tissue level, since species that use only ST show a
   smaller interscapular BAT patch, not detectable presence of UCP1 and low
   COX activity. Thus, other factors, including body mass, that constrain
   cold induced MMR could affect thermogenic variability among Ctenomys, In
   the evolutionary timescale, if low O-2 levels of burrows impose a
   ceiling in cold induced MMR, and ST is enhanced due to species-specific
   life history traits, such as digging effort, then the observed
   differences among Ctenomys species might be explained.

AB Estuarine biodiversity is impacted by climate change and anthropogenic
   use due to the high productivity of estuarine ecosystems and convenient
   human use of nearshore areas. Human use of estuaries (e.g. with
   dredging, filling, and invasive species introductions) has decimated
   subtidal and marsh ecosystems, thus making them the focus of major
   restoration efforts. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) such as eelgrass
   beds, and their associated communities, fall under these restoration
   efforts, especially in San Francisco Bay. Diverse eelgrass communities
   that include grazers, such as Phyllaplysia taylori, have been shown to
   maintain eelgrass health and promote increased biodiversity. This study
   addresses the need for simple, predictive models based on field data for
   use in SAV restoration that incorporates grazer diversity. Predictive
   models with ecological, abiotic, and landscape variables were generated
   that explained the presence of P. taylori in eelgrass beds along the
   coast of the western United States and seasonal patterns in population
   density. While surprising, the exclusion of abiotic factors in
   presence/absence model selection suggested that non-point source runoff
   promotes P. taylori populations via increased food and turbidity,
   resulting in decreased predation. P. taylori presence within eelgrass
   beds was best predicted by the positive impacts of nearshore irrigated
   land, vegetated land, and bare soil land. P. taylori abundance over time
   within one site was best described by the positive effects of eelgrass
   density and eelgrass length and the negative effects of epiphytic
   coverage and average temperature. These models were used to predict
   habitat suitability for P. taylori in seventeen San Francisco Bay
   eelgrass restoration areas in various phases of completion, indicating a
   53% P. taylori success rate. Incorporating population persistence
   knowledge from the SAV-associated invertebrate perspective is a step
   towards grazer community-minded restoration tactics.

AB Adaptive genetic differentiation along a climatic gradient as a response
   to natural selection is not necessarily expressed at phenotypic level if
   environmental effects on population mean phenotypes oppose the genotypic
   effects. This form of cryptic evolution - called countergradient
   variation - has seldom been explicitly demonstrated for terrestrial
   vertebrates. We investigated the patterns of phenotypic and genotypic
   differentiation in developmental rates of common frogs (Rana temporaria)
   along a ca. 1600 km latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia.
   Developmental rates in the field were not latitudinally ordered, but
   displayed large variation even among different ponds within a given
   latitudinal area. In contrast, development rates assessed in the
   laboratory increased strongly and linearly with increasing latitude,
   suggesting a genetic capacity for faster development in the northern
   than the southern larvae. Experiments further revealed that
   environmental effects (temperature and food) could easily override the
   genetic effects on developmental rates, providing a possible mechanistic
   explanation as to why the genetic differentiation was not seen in the
   samples collected from the wild. Our results suggest that the higher
   developmental rates of the northern larvae are likely to. be related to
   selection stemming from seasonal time constrains, rather than from
   selection dictated by low ambient temperatures per se. All in all, the
   results provide a demonstration of environmental effects concealing
   substantial latitudinally ordered genetic differentiation understandable
   in terms of adaptation to clinal variation in time constrains.

AB Flowering time is one of the most critical traits for plants' life
   cycles, which is influenced by various environment changes, such as
   global warming. Previous studies have suggested that to guarantee
   reproductive success, plants have shifted flowering times to adapt to
   global warming. Although many studies focused on the molecular
   mechanisms of early flowering, little was supported by the repeated
   sampling at different time points through the changing climate. To fully
   dissect the temporal and spatial evolutionary genetics of flowering
   time, we investigated nucleotide variation in ten flowering time
   candidate genes and nine reference genes for the same ten wild-barley
   populations sampled 28 years apart (1980-2008). The overall genetic
   differentiation was significantly greater in the descendant populations
   (2008) compared with the ancestral populations (1980); however, local
   adaptation tests failed to detect any single-nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP)/indel under spatial-diversifying selection at either time point.
   By contrast, the WFABC (Wright-Fisher ABC-based approach) that detected
   54 SNPs/indels was under strong selection during the past 28
   generations. Moreover, all these 54 alleles were segregated in the
   ancestral populations, but fixed in the descendent populations. Among
   the top ten SNPs/indels, seven were located in genes of FT1 (FLOWERING
   TIME LOCUS T1), CO1 (CONSTANS-LIKE PROTEIN 1), and VRN-H2
   (VERNALIZATION-H2), which have been documented to be associated with
   flowering time regulation in barley cultivars. This study might suggest
   that all ten populations have undergone parallel evolution over the past
   few decades in response to global warming, and even an overwhelming
   local adaptation and ecological differentiation.

AB It has been documented in some reptiles that fluctuating incubation
   temperatures influence hatchling traits differently than constant
   temperatures even when the means are the same between treatments; yet
   whether the observed effects result from the thermal variance,
   temperature extremes or both is largely unknown. We incubated eggs of
   the checkered keelback snake Xenochrophis piscator under one fluctuating
   (Ft) and three constant (24, 27 and 30 degrees C) temperatures to
   examine whether the variance of incubation temperatures plays in
   important role in influencing the phenotype of hatchlings. The thermal
   conditions under which eggs were incubated affected a number of
   hatchling traits (wet mass, SVL, tail length, carcass dry mass, fatbody
   dry mass and residual yolk dry mass) but not hatching success and the
   sex ratio of hatchlings. Body sizes were larger in hatchlings from
   incubation temperatures of 24 and 27 degrees C compared with the other
   two treatments. Hatchlings from the four treatments Could be divided
   into two groups: one included hatchlings from the 24 and 27 degrees C
   treatments, and the other included hatchlings from the 30 degrees C and
   Ft treatments. In the Ft treatment, the thermal variance was not a
   significant predictor of all examined hatchling traits, and incubation
   length was not correlated with the thermal variance when holding the
   thermal mean constant. The results of this Study show that the mean
   rather than the variance of incubation temperatures affects the
   phenotype of hatchlings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For terrestrial animals and plants, a fundamental cost of living is
   water vapor lost to the atmosphere during exchange of metabolic gases.
   Here, by bringing together previously developed models for specific
   taxa, we integrate properties common to all terrestrial gas exchangers
   into a universal model of water loss. The model predicts that water loss
   scales to gas exchange with an exponent of 1 and that the amount of
   water lost per unit of gas exchanged depends on several factors: the
   surface temperature of the respiratory system near the outside of the
   organism, the gas consumed (oxygen or carbon dioxide), the steepness of
   the gradients for gas and vapor, and the transport mode (convective or
   diffusive). Model predictions were largely confirmed by data on 202
   species in five taxa-insects, birds, bird eggs, mammals, and
   plants-spanning nine orders of magnitude in rate of gas exchange.
   Discrepancies between model predictions and data seemed to arise from
   biologically interesting violations of model assumptions, which
   emphasizes how poorly we understand gas exchange in some taxa. The
   universal model provides a unified conceptual framework for analyzing
   exchange-associated water losses across taxa with radically different
   metabolic and exchange systems.

   characterize the effects of minor and major activity variation on two
   different aspects of Gpdh function: the standing triglyceride pool and
   glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle-assisted flight. We observe small but
   statistically significant reductions in triglyceride content for adult
   Gpdh genotypes possessing 33-80% reductions from normal activity. These
   small differences scale to a notable proportion of the observed genetic
   variation in triglyceride content in natural populations. Using a
   tethered fly assay to assess flight metabolism, we observed that

AB Night, dawn, and dusk have abiotic features that differ from the day.
   Illumination, wind speeds, turbulence, and temperatures are lower while
   humidity may be higher at night. Nocturnal pollination occurred in 30%
   of angiosperm families across 68% of orders, 97% of families with C-3,
   two-thirds of families with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), and 71%
   dicot families with C-4 photosynthesis. Despite its widespread
   occurence, nocturnal pollination occurs in more families with xerophytic
   adaptations than helophytes or mesophytes, suggesting that nocturnal
   flowering is primarily an adaptation to water stress since flowering is
   a water-intensive process. We propose the arid or water stress
   hypothesis for nocturnal flowering suggesting that plants facing water
   stress in a habitat (e.g., deserts) or a habitat stratum (e.g., upper
   canopy for epiphytes) gain a selective advantage by nocturnal flowering
   by reducing water loss through evapotranspiration, leading to larger
   flowers that provide more nectar or other resources, to support
   pollinators with higher rewards. Contrary to the wide taxonomic
   occurrence of nocturnal flowering few animal taxa serve as nocturnal
   pollinators. We discuss the sensory and physiological abilities that
   enable pollinator movement, navigation, and detection of flowers within
   the nocturnal temporal niche and present a unified framework for
   investigation of nocturnal flowering and pollination.

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) influences the physiology of marine
   invertebrates, and, in turn, their geographical distribution. The
   Diadematidae sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii has expanded its range
   in Eastern Australia as a result of increased winter sea temperatures,
   and there is interest in the potential for the species to increase its
   range and abundance in New Zealand. We-investigated the extent to which
   embryonic and larval thermal tolerance of fertilization, cleavage,
   hatching, gastrulation and appearance of plutei may control the
   distribution of the adult populations in New Zealand. We also compared
   these individuals with an Australian population in northern New South
   Wales at Coffs Harbour from a region just north of where the Eastern
   Australian Current gives rise to the Tasman Front current to New
   Zealand. The aim of the present study was to find evidence for
   adaptation in fertilization and the developmental stages to New Zealand
   winter sea temperatures. Fertilization was not affected by temperature
   over a broad thermal range (12.0 degrees C-26.4 degrees C and 12.8
   degrees C-29.5 degrees C for the New Zealand and the Coffs Harbour
   population respectively). The first cleavage, hatching, gastrulation and
   appearance of plutei were more sensitive to temperature and occurred
   within a well-defined thermal window (17.2 degrees C-23.5 degrees C in
   New Zealand and 17.3 degrees C-24.5 degrees C in Coffs Harbour). The
   sites where C rodgersii adults have been reported in New Zealand lie on
   the 15 degrees C winter isotherm, consistent with our findings with
   regard to the lower temperature for pluteal development for the New
   Zealand population. We found evidence for a shift in thermal tolerance
   between the two populations of C. rodgersii examined, with fertilization
   and each developmental stage showing an upper thermal limit consistently
   shifted by approximate to 1 degrees C towards lower temperatures in New
   Zealand individuals. Our findings indicate that the thermal window for
   larval development of C. rodgersii may contribute to its present
   distribution in New Zealand. In addition, given that larval development
   in New Zealand presently occurs at the colder limit of the thermal
   window of C. rodgersii, there may be the potential for a future
   expansion of its distributional range under future ocean warming
   scenarios. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal forests play critical roles in global carbon, water and energy
   cycles. Recent studies suggest drought is causing a decline in boreal
   spruce growth, leading to predictions of widespread mortality and a
   shift in dominant vegetation type in interior Alaska. We took advantage
   of a large set of tree cores collected from random locations across a
   vast area of interior Alaska to examine long-term trends in carbon
   isotope discrimination and growth of black and white spruce. Our results
   confirm that growth of both species is sensitive to moisture
   availability, yet show limited evidence of declining growth in recent
   decades. These findings contrast with many earlier tree-ring studies,
   but agree with dynamic global vegetation model projections. We
   hypothesize that rising atmospheric [CO2] and/or changes in biomass
   allocation may have compensated for increasing evaporative demand,
   leaving recent radial growth near the long-term mean. Our results
   highlight the need for more detailed studies of tree physiological and
   growth responses to changing climate and atmospheric [CO2] in the boreal
   forest.

AB Neon flying squid, Ommastrephes bartramii, is a squid species of the
   North Pacific Ocean, which plays an important economical role in the
   international fishery. Logbook data for Chinese squid-jigging fishery
   over 2004-2011 were used to evaluate the relationship between the
   fishing grounds of the squid and the convergent frontal areas, which
   were defined by the contour lines of specific sea surface temperature
   (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. Our results indicate that
   the SST in the range of 15 to 19 degrees C and the Chl-a concentration
   in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 mg m(-3) are the favorable conditions for the
   aggregation of the squid. Additionally, we deduced that the SST at 17.5
   degrees C and the Chl-a concentration at 0.25 mg m(-3) are the optimal
   environmental conditions for the aggregation of O. bartramii. In August,
   the annual CPUE is positively correlated with the proportion of the
   fishing grounds with favorable SST and Chl-a concentration, as well as
   the combination of the two variables, implying that the abundance of the
   squid annually is largely depending on the presence of the favorable
   environmental conditions for fishery in August. Minor spatial difference
   between mean latitudinal location of the 17.5 degrees C SST and 0.25 mg
   m(-3) Chl-a fronts can increase the CPUEs of O. bartramii. Furthermore,
   the monthly latitudinal gravity centers of the CPUE closely followed the
   mean latitudinal position of the contour lines of the 17.5 degrees C SST
   and the 0.25 mg m(-3) Chl-a concentration. Our findings suggest the
   convergent oceanographic features (fronts) play significant roles in
   regulating the distribution and abundance of the western stock of the
   winter-spring cohort of O. bartramii, which can help people to improve
   their ability to discover the O. bartramii fishing grounds with higher
   productivity.

   in central Finland. The species studied represented a wide range

   series varied from 4 years up to 54 years during the 1952-2005
   observation period. An advancing trend (p < 0.05) in the timing of
   spring phenology was only found for five species (with over 15 years of
   observations), namely, Formica rufa group, Rana temporaria, Grus grus,
   Ficedula hypoleuca and Hirundinidae. In local species with more than 38
   years of observations, the temperature trend turned out to be the best
   variable to describe the advancement of the phenological event. For
   birds in six cases out of ten the best factor for explaining the
   advancement, as well as the temperature, was the NAO index.

AB During a repeat photography study quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides
   Michx.) was observed invading conifer stands at treeline in the San Juan
   Mountains of south-western Colorado. Aspen tree core samples were
   collected from nine plots ranging in elevation from 3192 to 3547 m, and
   estimated dates of establishment of aspen were grouped into 10-year
   intervals for analysis. Estimated periods of establishment were compared
   with century-long climate data records to derive any correlations with
   aspen invasion. Other disturbance agents, such as fire and livestock
   grazing were also considered. Quantitative analysis of climate variables
   suggests that decreased mean spring precipitation and increased mean
   summer maximum temperature provide optimal conditions for aspen
   establishment. Episodes of invasion were non-synchronous, but all
   occurred after 1900, and are likely from seed germination, considered
   unusual in aspen. Different climate variables explain stand initiation
   from seed and subsequent peak establishment from vegetative
   reproduction. Long-term climate records indicate a general warming since
   the beginning of the 20th century and explain the continued invasion and
   persistence of aspen at treeline, resulting from asexual reproduction.
   Short-term climate records identify anomalously cool, moist years that
   explain rarely observed sexual reproduction in aspen.

AB Circadian variations in core temperature, skin temperatures, heart rate,
   and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) were compared in subjects wearing
   two different types of clothing that covered, or left uncovered, their
   extremities. The experiments were carried out on six female subjects at
   an ambient temperature of 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C and relative humidity of
   50 +/- 5%. One type of clothing consisted of long-sleeved shirts,
   full-length trousers, and socks (Type L: 1042 g, 1.048 clo); the other
   was half-sleeved shirts and knee-length trousers (Type H: 747 g, 0.744
   clo). The main results were as follows: (i) The level of rectal
   temperature during night sleep was significantly lower with Type H than
   Type L clothing, and cosinor analysis indicated a significantly higher
   circadian amplitude with Type H clothing. (ii) Skin temperatures in the
   lower extremities increased significantly more on retiring to sleep with
   Type H than Type L clothing. (iii) Heart rate was significantly lower
   with Type H than Type L clothing during the sleep period. (iv) The
   day-night variation of salivary IgA showed a pattern that was the
   inverse of that of rectal temperature (i.e., low in the daytime and high
   in the nighttime), and the concentration of salivary IgA was
   significantly higher with Type H than Type L clothing at 02:30. (v)
   Subjectively, the self-assessed sleep quality was better with Type H
   clothing. These results suggest that clothing that leaves the
   extremities uncovered might be regarded as favorable at the moderate
   temperature since it induces good sleep and activates the immune
   response.

AB Maternal effects on progeny wing size and shape in a homozygous
   parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum were investigated. The
   impact of external maternal factors (heat stress) and the impact of
   internal maternal factors (different maternal and grand maternal age)
   were studied. The offspring developed under identical environmental
   conditions, and due to lack of genetic variation any phenotypic
   difference among offspring could be ascribed to maternal effects. Wing
   size was estimated by centroid size, shape was analysed with the
   Procrustes geometric morphometric method and variation in landmark
   displacement was visualized by principal component analysis. Both kinds
   of maternal effects had a significant impact on progeny wing size and
   shape. Maternal heat stress led to the same pattern of response in size
   and shape among the progeny, with increased difference between the
   control group and progeny from heat stressed flies in both size and
   shape with increased maternal heat stress temperature. The effects of
   maternal age, however, led to different responses in size and shape
   between the different progeny groups. The observed variation in landmark
   displacements was similar, and in both cases mainly associated with
   shape differences of the posterior part of the wing. Finally, our
   results suggest that maternal effect has some evolutionary implications
   by altering the genetic correlations among traits, which can affect the
   response to selective pressures.

AB The highly productive eastern Bering Sea shelf has undergone a dramatic

   has been highlighted by the northern rock sole stock. which has
   increased well over 15 times from approximately 175 x 10(6) kg in 1975
   to nearly 3 x 10(9) kg in 1994. Annual bottom trawl surveys and an
   age-structured population model have been used to track the increase.
   A new evaluation of the data has shown significant decreases in
   length-at-age (and resultant weight-at-age) as the population increased
   and expanded westward toward the shelf edge. The downward trend in
   length-at-age primarily affected year classes between 1979 and 1987. A
   small increase has occurred subsequently. Potential density-dependent
   relationships are examined with the significant regression of mean
   length at age-3 versus population changes. These differences in growth
   were incorporated into a stock assessment model to examine their effect
   on estimates of recruitment variability, fluctuations in stock biomass
   and yield recommendations. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB It is clear from a variety of data that cod (Gadus morhua) in the North
   Sea do not constitute a homogeneous population that will rapidly
   redistribute in response to local variability in exploitation. Hence,
   local exploitation has the potential to deplete local populations,
   perhaps to the extent that depensation Occurs and recovery is impossible
   without recolonisation from other areas, with consequent loss of genetic
   diversity. The oceanographic, biological and behavioural processes which
   maintain the spatial Population structures are only partly understood,
   and one of the key unknown factors is the extent to which cod exhibit
   homing migrations to natal spawning areas. Here, we describe a model
   comprising 10 interlinked demes of cod in European waters, each
   representing groups of fish with a common natal origin.The spawning
   locations of fish in each deme are governed by a variety of rules
   concerning oceanographic dispersal, migration behaviour and straying. We
   describe numerical experiments with the model and comparisons with
   observations, which lead its to conclude that active homing is probably
   not necessary to explain some of the population structures of European
   cod. Separation of some sub-populations is possible through distance and
   oceanographic processes affecting the dispersal of eggs and larvae.
   However, other evidence Suggests that homing may be a necessary
   behaviour to explain the structure of other sub-populations. The
   consequences for fisheries management of taking into account spatial
   population structuring are complicated. For example, recovery or
   recolonisation strategies require consideration not only of mortality
   rates in the target area for restoration, but also in the Source areas
   for the recruits which may be far removed depending on the oceanography.
   The model has an inbuilt capability to address issues concerning the
   effects of climate change, including temperature change, on spatial
   patterns of recruitment, development and population structure in cod.

AB Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), especially juveniles,
   are abundant in the St. Lawrence estuary, where oxygen levels are very
   low (18-25% saturation). Current data suggest that juveniles may be
   sedentary in this region. We investigated the relative importance of
   oxygen for juvenile growth in different areas occupied by juveniles in
   the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL). More specifically, we
   examined the mean size-at-age for 1- and 2-year-old juveniles as well as
   the growth rate in different areas in relation to oxygen, depth,
   temperature, and juvenile density. Overall, oxygen concentration was
   found to affect juvenile Greenland Halibut growth: growth rate varied
   inversely with dissolved oxygen levels and significantly decreased when
   oxygen conditions were below 80 mu mol/L (similar to 25% saturation).
   Temperature did not affect juvenile growth rates within the range found
   in these areas (4.95-5.14 degrees C). Mean lengths in 1- and 2-year-old
   juveniles (17 and 27 cm, respectively) as well as length increment
   estimates from 1 to 2 years old in the EGSL were much higher than those
   observed in other populations of Greenland Halibut. Length increment
   from ages 1 and 2 ranged between 8 and 12 cm for temperatures varying
   from 3.7 to 5.5 degrees C. We found the highest abundance of juveniles
   in bottom waters characterized by low oxygen concentrations and also
   found that there was continuous juvenile growth over the year; these
   observations suggest that the negative impacts of dissolved oxygen
   should be limited and/or largely compensated by other physical or
   biological characteristics of the EGSL, such as food abundance, food
   availability, and/or predator density. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Most models developed for the movement and fate of eggs and larvae of
   aquatic species are based on a particle tracking approach. Although this
   method has many advantages due to its high flexibility, particle
   tracking may become computationally intensive for complex geometries and
   when large numbers of particles are needed to simulate the population
   properly. In continuous models based on advection and dispersion
   mechanisms, the computational burden is independent of the size of the
   population. We developed a continuous fate and transport model for
   striped bass eggs and larvae in the San Francisco Bay-Delta. The model
   predicts the concentration of eggs and larvae at any location over time.
   The method of moments was used to account for the effect of temperature
   and age on the transition of eggs to larvae and larvae to juveniles. Egg
   and larval mortality were represented as functions of temperature, and
   eggs also experienced settling mortality. The fate and transport model
   used the same one-dimensional spatial grid as the existing Delta
   Simulation Model II (DSM2) hydrodynamics model. DSM2 output of flow
   rates, water depths, and cross-sectional areas were inputted into the
   fate and transport model to determine transport. The model was applied
   to striped bass eggs and larvae data collected during years 1990-1994;
   agreement between the modeled and the measured data was acceptable in
   most cases. Exploratory simulations were performed to demonstrate how
   the model could be used to evaluate the effects on egg and larval
   survival and total juvenile production of water diversions for supply
   and agricultural use and changes in the long-term mean water
   temperature. The model can be further used to examine the impact of
   various operation strategies in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, where
   diversion losses of early life stages of fishes remain a major
   management issue. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Virtually all current estimates of the maximum carboxylation rate
   (V-cmax) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)
   and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) for C-3 species
   implicitly assume an infinite CO2 transfer conductance (g(i)). And yet,
   most measurements in perennial plant species or in ageing or stressed
   leaves show that g(i) imposes a significant limitation on
   photosynthesis. Herein, we demonstrate that many current
   parameterizations of the photosynthesis model of Farquhar, von Caemmerer
   & Berry (Planta 149, 78-90, 1980) based on the leaf intercellular CO2
   concentration (C-i) are incorrect for leaves where g(i) limits
   photosynthesis. We show how conventional A-C-i curve (net CO2
   assimilation rate of a leaf -A(n)- as a function of C-i) fitting methods
   which rely on a rectangular hyperbola model under the assumption of
   infinite g(i) can significantly underestimate V-cmax for such leaves.
   Alternative parameterizations of the conventional method based on a
   single, apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for CO2 evaluated at
   C-i[K-m(CO2)(i)] used for all C-3 plants are also not acceptable since
   the relationship between V-cmax and g(i) is not conserved among species.
   We present an alternative A-C-i curve fitting method that accounts for
   g(i) through a non-rectangular hyperbola version of the model of
   <Farquhar et al. (1980). Simulated and real examples are used to
   demonstrate how this new approach eliminates the errors of the
   conventional A-C-i curve fitting method and provides V-cmax estimates
   that are virtually insensitive to g(i). Finally, we show how the new
   A-C-i curve fitting method can be used to estimate the value of the
   kinetic constants of Rubisco in vivo is presented.

AB The objective of this paper is to examine three sediment parameters used
   in paleolimnological studies, sediment organic, carbonate and biogenic
   silica (BSi) content, and to quantify the relationship among these
   parameters and modern environmental conditions for a series of Canadian
   Arctic lakes. Sediment samples from 63 lakes were analysed for organic,
   carbonate and BSi content. The environmental and physical parameters of
   these lakes were recorded. Bedrock composition exerted a very strong
   influence on sediment organic, BSi and carbonate content, and
   differences in lake production accounted for much of the remaining
   variance. The strongest relationships existed among sediment carbonate
   content, BSi content and water pH. A statistical model developed for
   predicting water pH provides a new tool for reconstructing past
   environmental conditions for Arctic aquatic ecosystems. A positive
   relationship between mean July air temperature and sediment organic and
   BSi content was detected, but was confounded by effects of bedrock on
   these parameters. However, the relationship between mean July air
   temperature and sediment organic and BSi could be even more significant
   in the context of constant bedrock composition, as is the case in
   paleolimnological studies.

AB (1) Chronic exposure to cold (5 degreesC) induced hypertension in rats
   within one week. (2) Chronic central administration of an I-1
   imidazoline receptor agonist, rilmenidine, prevented the development of
   cold-induced hypertension (CIH). (3) Plasma renin activity and urine
   norepinephrine output were significantly decreased by central
   administration of rilmenidine during cold acclimation. (4) Pressor
   response to central injection of angiotensin II (AII) was inhibited by
   rilmenidine. (5) Thus, activation of central I1 receptors could prevent
   the development of CIH and this may be related to inhibition of pressor
   effect of central AII. This finding reveals possible relationship
   between central I-1 and AII receptors in cardiovascular responses to
   chronic cold exposure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights
