AB Several empirical studies have shown that variation in daily energy
   expenditure (DEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is influenced by
   environmental and individual factors, but whether these shared
   influences are responsible for, or independent of, relationships between
   DEE and RMR remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to (i)
   simultaneously evaluate the effects of environmental and individual
   variables on DEE and RMR in free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias
   striatus) and (ii) quantify the correlation between DEE and RMR before
   and after controlling for common sources of variation. We found that the
   influence of individual factors on DEE and RMR is most often shared,
   whereas the influence of environmental factors tends to be distinct.
   Both raw and mass-adjusted DEE and RMR were significantly correlated,
   but this correlation vanished after accounting for the shared effect of
   reproduction on both traits. However, within reproductive individuals,
   DEE and RMR remained positively correlated after accounting for all
   other significant covariates. The ratio of DEE to RMR was significantly
   higher during reproduction than at other times of the year and was
   negatively correlated with ambient temperature. DEE and RMR appear to be
   inherently correlated during reproduction, but this correlation does not
   persist during other, less energy-demanding periods of the annual cycle.

AB Attempts to explain size variation in Drosophila and other small insects
   often focus on the larval stage and association between development time
   and size, but patterns are also influenced by direct selection on
   size-related traits in the adults. Here we use multiple field releases
   of Drosophila melanogaster to test the association between size and one
   component of field fitness, the ability of Drosophila to locate
   resources for feeding and breeding. We find antagonistic selection
   between wing length and thorax length in both males and females, such
   that capture at baits is higher for flies with relatively larger thorax
   lengths and smaller wings. However flies with large wings relative to
   thoraces disperse further as reflected in the longer distances moved to
   baits. These patterns did not depend strongly on weather conditions,
   suggesting that selection on adult size is at least partly independent
   of temperature. Antagonistic selection between size traits can generate
   changes in size along gradients if the distribution of resources in the
   environment varies and selects for different dispersal patterns,
   particularly as dispersal is relatively higher under warmer conditions.

AB Predicting how bird populations may respond to climate change is a major
   challenge which could be addressed by understanding how past
   environmental processes have driven the variations of breeding
   population size and productivity. In inhabited regions, this issue may
   be complicated by the interference associated with heterogeneous levels
   of habitat management. Here, we have explored how several hydrological
   variables influenced the breeding of the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus
   roseus in the Camargue (Rhone delta, southern France) over a 28-year
   period (1974-2001). In this region, Flamingos breed in a commercial salt
   pan. They forage in both salt pans and adjacent brackish lagoons. We
   hypothesized that breeding numbers, productivity and body condition of
   chicks at fledging were influenced positively by water levels of the
   Vaccares, the main lagoon of the delta, in spring (water and food
   availability) and the Rhone discharge in winter (nutrient availability
   in the salt pans). We controlled for variations of the flooding date of
   the breeding salt pan by the salt company and the size of the breeding
   island. We first found the Vaccares water levels and Rhone discharge to
   be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
   Secondly, the number of Flamingo breeding pairs (range 3560-22 200)
   increased by 1767 +/- 1418 (95% CI) with a 10-day advance of the
   flooding date of the breeding salt pan and by 1146 +/- 1081 per 10-cm
   water level rise in the Vaccares. Productivity was 0.46 +/- 0.41 chicks
   per pair and could not be explained by any of the variables considered.
   Finally, chick body condition decreased with the number of breeding
   pairs and Rhone discharge. Our results show that (1) this intensely
   managed system remains sensitive to large-scale climate variations, (2)
   the breeding of the Greater Flamingo is affected by both climate
   variations and management of the salt pan, and (3) the expected
   enhancement of delta productivity by high river discharge was absent,
   probably prevented by dykes and embankments along the river. The
   response of bird populations to climate variations can thus be complex
   in intensely managed biological systems as found in the Mediterranean.
   We encourage pursuing such analyses incorporating anthropogenic
   variables explicitly in order to expand our capacity to make inference
   on the future of these systems.

AB We analyzed sediment diatoms from core MD05-2908 to infer climate and
   paleoenvironmental changes in the southern Okinawa Trough (SOT) over the
   past 1000 years. Because the study area is located in the East Asia
   monsoon area and beneath the main axis of Kuroshio Current, the climatic
   and hydrographical conditions are strongly influenced by both of these
   factors. The species used as environmental indicators, including the
   Kuroshio Current species (KC species) and freshwater species, were
   investigated in this paper. Changes in the abundance of the two groups
   of species revealed significant variations in water temperature and
   hydrography in the SOT during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the
   Little Ice Age (LIA). From 950-1500 AD, the abundance of the KC species
   increased fluctuantly, while the freshwater species decreased, showing
   that the influence of the Kuroshio Current was intensified at that
   interval and the precipitation of the study area was relatively low. The
   KC species decreased remarkably and was maintained at a low abundance
   during the interval of 1500-1900 AD, which suggests that the impact of
   the Kuroshio Current on the SOT weakened during the period corresponding
   to the LIA. Moreover, the high abundance of the freshwater species at
   the same interval indicates a distinct increase in precipitation in
   northeastern Taiwan, which may be correlated to the south-detention of
   the rainfall belt in China caused by the southward migration of the
   western Pacific subtropical high.

AB Knowledge of how species interactions are influenced by climate warming
   is paramount to understand current biodiversity changes. We review
   phenological changes of Swedish butterflies during the latest decades
   and explore potential climate effects on butterfly-host plant
   interactions using the Orange tip butterfly Anthocharis cardamines and
   its host plants as a model system. This butterfly has advanced its
   appearance dates substantially, and its mean flight date shows a
   positive correlation with latitude. We show that there is a large
   latitudinal variation in host use and that butterfly populations select
   plant individuals based on their flowering phenology. We conclude that
   A. cardamines is a phenological specialist but a host species
   generalist. This implies that thermal plasticity for spring development
   influences host utilization of the butterfly through effects on the
   phenological matching with its host plants. However, the host
   utilization strategy of A. cardamines appears to render it resilient to
   relatively large variation in climate.

AB Plant phenological observations are of increasing value as indicators of
   climate change and variability. We developed a robust multispecies
   estimate for Swiss Alpine spring phenology for the period 1965-2002 by
   applying empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on a combination
   of 15 spring phases. The impact of climate parameters such as
   temperature and precipitation on the phenological development was
   investigated using a multivariate statistical model. This multispecies
   estimate proved to be a good approach to assess the pattern of spring
   appearance during the last 40 years. It revealed an earlier onset of
   spring in recent years, mainly since 1988 when a clear shift in spring
   appearance occurred. The mean overall trend of 1.5 days per decade was
   clearly driven by winter and spring temperatures whereas precipitation
   showed no significant influence. The dominant EOF patterns suggested a
   general climate forcing for the observed inter-annual variability
   independent of single plant phases. A more regional phenology signal was
   found in the second EOF mode, indicating slightly weaker phenological
   trends in southern Switzerland as well as in higher altitudes. Both,
   temperature and precipitation contributed to this pattern significantly.
   Analysis of single phases confirmed the pattern of the multispecies
   estimate. All species showed trends towards earlier appearance ranging
   from -1 to -2.8 days per decade and the appearance dates had a very high
   covariance with temperature.

AB Correlations among life history parameters have been discussed in the
   ecological literature for over 50 years, but are often estimated while
   treating model estimates of demographic rates such as natural mortality
   (M) or individual growth (k) as data. This approach fails to propagate
   uncertainty appropriately because it ignores correlations in estimation
   errors between parameters within a species and differences in estimation
   error among species. An improved alternative is multi-species
   mixed-effects modeling, which we approximate using multivariate
   likelihood profiles in an approach that synthesizes information from
   several population dynamics models. Simulation modeling demonstrates
   that this approach has minimal bias, and that precision improves with
   increased number of species. As a case study, we demonstrate this
   approach by estimating M/k for 11 groundfish species off the U.S. West
   Coast using the data and functional forms on which pre-existing,
   peer-reviewed, population dynamics models are based. M/k is estimated to
   be 1.26 for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), with a coefficient of
   variation of 76% for M given k. This represents the first-ever estimate
   of correlations among life history parameters for marine fishes using
   several age-structured population dynamics models, and it serves as a
   standard for future life history correlation studies. This approach can
   be modified to provide robust estimates of other life history parameters
   and correlations, and requires few changes to existing population
   dynamics models and software input files for both marine and terrestrial
   species. Specific results for Pacific rockfishes can be used as a
   Bayesian prior for estimating natural mortality in future fisheries
   management efforts. We therefore recommend that fish population dynamics
   models be compiled in a global database that can be used to
   simultaneously analyze observation-level data for many species in life
   history meta-analyses.

AB The present study describes and compares the thermal behavior of
   individuals of Liolaemus wiegmannii, inhabiting patches of natural
   grassland and modified patches with exotic trees of Acacia longifolia,
   by analyzing the factors affecting its behavior. Thermal behavior of L
   wiegmannii was assessed by radiotracking 22 adult individuals in a
   coastal dune area from Argentina. In order to account for individual
   responses we analyzed the factors affecting thermal behavior using
   Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Thermal behavior of L wiegmannii was
   mainly affected by the time of day and the substrate temperature. The
   individuals basking on bare sand in the morning shifted to filtered
   sunlight during midday and to the shade of clump and erect stems and
   herbs during the afternoon. The individuals buried in sand when the
   substrate temperature was low and the wind speed was high. The use of
   sub-shrubs and shrubs could not be explained solely by thermal factors.
   In natural L. wiegmannii regulated its body temperature by shuttling
   between microhabitats that provided them with different levels of
   exposure to sunlight during the day. However, in modified patches
   individuals varied in the choice of plants used as shaded places to
   mitigate high microenvironmental temperatures and they were also more
   exposed to full shaded sites and less to warm sand to bask, which could
   have negative consequences for its thermal biology. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Slow life histories are characterized by high adult survival and few
   offspring, which are thought to allow increased investment per offspring
   to increase juvenile survival. Consistent with this pattern, south
   temperate zone birds are commonly longer-lived and have fewer young than
   north temperate zone species. However, comparative analyses of juvenile
   survival, including during the first few weeks of the post-fledging
   period when most juvenile mortality occurs, are largely lacking. We
   combined our measurements of fledgling survival for eight passerines in
   South Africa with estimates from published studies of 57 north and south
   temperate zone songbird species to test three predictions: (1) fledgling
   survival increases with length of development time in the nest; (2)
   fledgling survival increases with adult survival and reduced brood size
   controlled for development time; and (3) south temperate zone species,
   with their higher adult survival and smaller brood sizes, exhibit higher
   fledgling survival than north temperate zone species controlled for
   development time. We found that fledgling survival was higher among
   south temperate zone species and generally increased with development
   time and adult survival within and between latitudinal regions. Clutch
   size did not explain additional variation, but was confounded with adult
   survival. Given the importance of age-specific mortality to life history
   evolution, understanding the causes of these geographical patterns of
   mortality is important.

AB In fishes, performance failure at high temperature is thought to be due
   to a limitation on oxygen delivery (the theory of oxygen and capacity
   limited thermal tolerance, OCLTT), which suggests that thermal tolerance
   and hypoxia tolerance might be functionally associated. Here we examined
   variation in temperature and hypoxia tolerance among 41 families of
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which allowed us to evaluate the
   association between these two traits. Both temperature and hypoxia
   tolerance varied significantly among families and there was a
   significant positive correlation between critical maximum temperature
   (CTmax) and hypoxia tolerance, supporting the OCLTT concept. At the
   organ and cellular levels, we also discovered support for the OCLTT
   concept as relative ventricle mass (RVM) and cardiac myoglobin (Mb)
   levels both correlated positively with CTmax (R-2=0.21, P<0.001 and
   R-2=0.17, P=0.003, respectively). A large RVM has previously been shown
   to be associated with high cardiac output, which might facilitate tissue
   oxygen supply during elevated oxygen demand at high temperatures, while
   Mb facilitates the oxygen transfer from the blood to tissues, especially
   during hypoxia. The data presented here demonstrate for the first time
   that RVM and Mb are correlated with increased upper temperature
   tolerance in fish. High phenotypic variation between families and
   greater similarity among full-and half-siblings suggests that there is
   substantial standing genetic variation in thermal and hypoxia tolerance,
   which could respond to selection either in aquaculture or in response to
   anthropogenic stressors such as global climate change.

AB The balance between energetic acquisition and expenditure depends on the
   amount of energy allocated to biological functions such as
   thermoregulation, growth, reproduction and behavior. Ambient temperature
   has a profound effect on this balance, with species inhabiting colder
   climates often needing to invest more energy in thermoregulation to
   maintain body temperature. This leads to local behavioral and
   physiological adaptations that increase energetic efficiency. In this
   study, we investigated the role of activity, behavior and thermogenic
   capacity in the ability of the greater white-toothed shrew, Crocidura
   russula, to cope with seasonal changes. Individuals were captured in the
   Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, a Mediterranean region, and separated into
   three experimental groups: a control group, acclimated to a 12L:12D
   photoperiod and temperature of 18-20 degrees C; a winter group,
   acclimatized to natural winter fluctuations of light and temperature;
   and a summer group, acclimatized to natural summer fluctuations of light
   and temperature. No differences were found in resting metabolic rate and
   nonshivering thermogenesis between the three groups. However, winter
   shrews significantly reduced their activity, particularly at night,
   compared to the control and summer groups. Differences in torpor use
   were also found between groups, with winter shrews entering torpor more
   frequently and during shorter periods of time than summer and control
   shrews. Our results indicate C russula from Sintra relies on the
   flexibility of energy saving mechanisms, namely daily activity level and
   torpor use, to cope with seasonal changes in a Mediterranean climate,
   rather than mechanisms involving body heat production. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Projected changes in surface climate are reviewed at a range of temporal
   scales, with an emphasis on tropical northern Africa-a region considered
   to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Noting the key aspects
   of 'weather' affecting crop yield, we then consider relevant and
   projected change using output from a range of state of the art global
   climate models (GCMs), and for different future emission scenarios. The
   outputs from the models reveal significant inter-model variation in the
   change expected by the end of the twenty-first century for even the
   lowest IPCC emission scenario. We provide a set of recommendations on
   future model diagnostics, configurations and ease of use to close
   further the gap between GCMs and smaller-scale crop models. This has the
   potential to empower countries to make their own assessments of
   vulnerability to climate change induced periods of food scarcity.

AB We developed the model PHENIPS for spatial and temporal simulation of
   the seasonal development of Ips typographus at the Kalkalpen National
   Park in Austria. The model is based on a digital elevation model used
   for interpolation of temperature and solar radiation to calculate the
   microclimatic conditions (bark temperature) for the beetles'
   development. Additionally, the beetles' phenology at Kalkalpen National
   Park was monitored along with air and bark temperature measurements. The
   onset of host tree infestation in spring was estimated using a lower
   threshold of 16.5 degrees C for flight activity and a mean thermal sum
   of 140 degree-days (dd) from beginning of April 1st onward. Rate of
   brood development was calculated from accumulated degree-days of hourly
   temperature data using upper and lower temperature thresholds of 38.9
   and 8.3 degrees C, respectively, and a nonlinear function for
   calculating effective thermal sums. Re-emergence of parental beetles
   occurred at a time when 49.7% of the thermal sum for total development
   (557 dd) was reached. The model includes the discontinuance of the
   beetle's reproductive activity at a day length < 14.5 h. The rate of
   successful hibernation of established broods is predicted by assessing
   the developmental stage of initiated generations at the beginning of the
   cold period. For validation we compared the timing of phenological
   events in the field with predicted events using both, hourly recorded
   data at trap trees in the terrain and generated daily topoclimatic data.
   Using topoclimatic data, the onset of infestation was predicted with a
   mean absolute error of 1.3 days. The observed onset of emergence of
   filial beetles in the field was estimated with a mean error of 39 dd.
   Our PHENIPS explicitly considers the strong effects of regional
   topography and stand conditions on local air and bark temperature and
   can be used for precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle
   development at the specific stand/tree level. Using topoclimatic data,
   PHENIPS simulates the maximum number of generations which is necessary
   to assess the potential impact of bark beetle outbreaks at regional
   scale. Further applications of PHENIPS for site-specific hazard rating
   of bark beetle infestation are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Leaves of Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden were sampled during
   establishment of seedlings that were deprived of nutrients or fertilised
   at planting. Extracts were analysed for polyphenolic compounds using
   high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in conjunction with UV diode
   array and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with
   negative ion detection as well as direct MS injection. The presence of
   quercetin, rutin, sideroxylonal A and B and penta-galloylglucose were
   confirmed by comparison with standards. Other galloylglucoses were
   identified by first principles. Galloylglucoses comprised about 75% of
   polyphenolics. Quercetin and various quercetin glycosides comprised ca
   85% of flavonols. The anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glycoside and
   cyanidin-3,5-diglycoside were identified from direct injection MS data.
   HPLC-ESI-MS was found to be a superior analytical technique compared to
   conventional HPLC-UV diode array detection due to co-elution of peaks
   under UV. Temporal variation of anthocyanins may be related to the
   severity of cold-induced photoinhibition. Changes in galloylglucoses and
   flavonols were similar with time and related to levels of foliar
   nitrogen. The suitability of HPLC-ESI-MS for the study of foliar
   polyphenolics, the phenolic constitution of E. nitens foliage, and
   temporal variation of the phenolic constituents during a seedling
   establishment period of 29 weeks are demonstrated.

AB Cucumber is generally a thermophilic species; however, cultivars have
   been selected for higher yield during winter cultivation in unheated
   glasshouses in temperate regions. We tested whether photosynthesis in
   these varieties had greater chilling tolerance. There was no difference
   in the instantaneous reduction of photosynthesis at low temperature
   between four winter glasshouse and four summer field cultivars. After 5
   d of 10degreesC and 100 mumol m(-2) s(-1) photon flux density, the four
   field cultivars had a sustained depression of photosynthesis after
   returning to clement conditions. This inhibition was associated with
   reduced rates of CO2 fixation and photosystem II (PSII) electron
   transport in the light, but not with sustained PSII photoinhibition.
   However, photosynthesis in the glasshouse genotypes was nearly identical
   to the pre-chill rates. Chill impacts on light-adapted chlorophyll
   fluorescence parameters, such as the quantum yield of PSII electron
   transport (phi(PSII)), correlated well with overall photosynthesis. This
   demonstrates the potential for using these fast and noninvasive
   techniques to screen for chill-tolerant genotypes, with the potential to
   further improve winter cucumber yield in unheated glasshouses.

AB Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when opposing selection pressures
   operate on loci expressed in both sexes, constraining the evolution of
   sexual dimorphism and displacing one or both sexes from their optimum.
   We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting
   transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to
   win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here, we show that this male-limited
   (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of
   masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and
   allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution
   resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However,
   females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable,
   suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to
   development. We suggest that sexual selection over size and shape of the
   imago may therefore explain the persistence of substantial genetic
   variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying
   them.

AB Different physiological thresholds of species across biogeographic
   boundaries can show a long-term scope for adaptation. Characterised by
   cold-stenothermal conditions, polar and deep-sea environments are
   constrained by thermal stability across wide regions, and polar
   invertebrates are broadly considered to be highly sensitive to only
   subtle changes in thermal regime. We examine the respiratory response of
   two distinct biogeographic populations of the widespread bivalve
   Lissarca notorcadensis from deep waters in the Southern Ocean to acute
   thermal changes, and present distinct respiratory responses for each
   population. Populations from the Weddell Sea living in cooler water
   temperatures (< 0 A degrees C) show a lower tolerance to temperature
   increases, identified by an increase in oxygen consumption at
   temperatures from -1 to 4 A degrees C and mortality at 5 A degrees C. In
   contrast, populations from the Scotia Sea, experiencing a thermally more
   variable cold-stenothermal environment driven by seasonality, show no
   significant increase in oxygen consumption up to 6 A degrees C before
   peaking at 8 A degrees C, and mortality during acclimation to 9 A
   degrees C. Our results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that
   long-term adaptation to thermal envelopes, over multiple generations,
   likely determines the degree of thermal resilience to warming and at
   population-specific levels. This contrasts to previous laboratory-based
   (short-term acclimation or acute) thermal response studies, which have
   shown high sensitivities and low acclimation capacities to temperature
   increases. We highlight the need for long-term acclimation studies and
   pose questions as to how selection for population-specific thermal
   tolerances may take place in a global warming scenario and within a
   macroecological context.

AB The influence of body mass (M-b) on the physiology of large, adult fish
   is poorly understood, in part because of the logistical difficulties of
   studying large individuals. For the first time, this study quantified
   the influence of M-b on the resting heart rate (f(H)), blood properties
   and organ masses of adults of a large-growing fish species, the Chinook
   salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Surgically implanted biologgers
   measured f(H) and acceleration activity in sexually mature, male fish
   ranging in M-b from 2.7 to 16.8. kg while they roamed freely in a
   controlled water body at similar to 8 degrees C. Blood parameters (at
   surgery and at death) and body organ masses (at death) were measured to
   investigate interrelationships with M-b. The scaling exponents for both
   f(H) and acceleration activity were not significantly different from
   zero. The lack of scaling of f(H) with M-b contrasts with the situation
   for birds and mammals. All blood parameters were independent of M-b,
   while the masses of the compact myocardium, ventricle and spleen each
   scaled near-isometrically with M-b. These data raise the possibility
   that blood oxygen carrying capacity, mass-specific cardiac output and
   cardiac power output are maintained across M-b in adult Chinook salmon.
   Biologging and biotelemetry should advance investigations into the
   effects of M-b on the physiology and behaviour of large fish, where
   current knowledge lags far behind that of birds and mammals.

AB There is a latitudinal gradient in the species richness of Decapoda with
   pelagic larvae. For example, only two species of Brachyura are found
   around Svalbard, 54 species are known from the English Channel and
   similar to 100 from the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula. The
   distributions of many species are limited by effects of temperature.
   Intermoult times of larvae are inversely related to temperature. In the
   field the size of larvae is inversely related to temperature, the
   relationship tending to increase in significance in successive larval
   stages. The timing of the seasonal occurrence of larvae of decapod
   species in the plankton is also related to temperature, to a greater
   extent than are seasonal cycles of the holoplankton. These effects of
   temperature on larval development influence the biomass and production
   of the larvae in the plankton. Some potential effects of climate change
   on the distributions and dynamics of planktonic larvae of decapods and
   consequent changes in their diversity, biomass and production can be
   predicted insofar as temperature is a limiting factor.

AB In this study, we examine the simulation results from the paleoclimate
   version of the National Center of Atmospheric Research coupled Climate
   System Model (CSM 1.4) for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in order to
   understand changes in the South Atlantic (SA) circulation relative to
   the Present Day (PD). The LGM simulation is validated with the available
   proxy data in the region. The results show good agreement, except in the
   eastern equatorial and eastern SA region, where the model is not able to
   reproduce the correct cloud cover and the associated air-sea
   interactions. Ocean transport in the PD simulation is in good agreement
   with observational estimates. Results show that at subsurface levels
   there are two distinct patterns: (i) strengthening of the transport for
   the LGM in the southern SA (35 to 25 degrees S); and (ii) weakening of
   the mass transport in the northern SA (25 degrees S to the Equator). In
   intermediate layers, there is an intensification of the subtropical gyre
   and a northward shift of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) bifurcation
   for the LGM. This leads to the intensification of the southward
   transport by the Brazil Current (BC) and the associated BC recirculation
   cell in the southern basin for the LGM. This shift in the position of
   the SEC bifurcation leads to a weakening in the northward transport and
   the western recirculation of the central SEC in the northern basin. This
   northward shift of the SEC (upper limit of the subtropical gyre) is
   consistent with the northward shift observed in the subtropical
   convergence zone and suggests a displacement of the sub-tropical gyre 3
   degrees-5 degrees towards the Equator. In deeper layers, a shallower and
   weaker North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) circulation in the LGM
   contributes to the reduction of the southward transport in the northern
   part of the basin and is associated with a greater northward intrusion
   of Antarctic Bottom Water. This intrusion plus the increase of the
   Indian Water inflow is responsible for the northward transport
   intensification in the southern basin. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Our ability to predict the effects of climate change on the spread of

   conflicting, predictions have been developed, principally based on
   models of biological processes or mapping of current and historical
   disease statistics. Current debates on whether climate change, relative
   to socioeconomic determinants, will be a major influence on human
   disease distributions are useful to help identify research needs but are
   probably artificially polarized. We have at least identified many of the
   critical geophysical constraints, transport opportunities, biotic
   requirements for some disease systems, and some of the socioeconomic
   factors that govern the process of migration and establishment of
   parasites and pathogens. Furthermore, we are beginning to develop a
   mechanistic understanding of many of these variables at specific sites.
   Better predictive understanding will emerge in the coming years from
   analyses regarding how these variables interact with each other.

   variance was dominated by a spore-by-environment interaction. The
   increase of among-spore variance with distance was detectable but
   slight, showing that most of the diversity found on the transect was
   present at a scale of metres. A mixture of all spores, constituting the
   founder assemblage, was propagated for 50-70 generations in three
   environments to study the sorting of variation initially present in the
   assemblage. Adaptation to the new environments was measured by
   improvement in growth relative to the founder assemblage. All three sets
   of lines became adapted to their selection environment., although the
   extent of the advance depended on the amount of among-spore variance in
   the founder assemblage. Selection for increased growth in the dark, or
   at high nutrient conditions in the light, caused the assemblage to
   evolve to the limit of the variation initially present, strongly
   reducing among-spore variance as a consequence. At low nutrient
   concentrations selection was less effective. and there was little
   reduction of the among-spore variance. The correlated responses of each
   group, again relative to the founder assemblage, were measured over the
   entire experimental range. Correlated responses were negative when
   performance in widely different (light and dark) environments was
   compared, but positive for more similar environments (high and low
   nutrient concentrations).

AB Aim To present a method that assesses the influence of environmental
   variables, including climate, substrate, topography, and anthropogenic
   disturbances, on the distribution of Andean forest at the tree line, and
   to compare this forest distribution between areas.
   Location Sangay National Park, on the eastern slopes of the Andes in
   central Ecuador.
   Methods A logistic regression model was built using topographical
   variables and environmental indices, derived from a digital elevation
   model, to explain forest cover, derived from a Landsat ETM image, in a
   zone around the average tree line altitude.
   Results The model shows that after altitude, which can explain about 80%
   of forest cover, wetness has the next strongest effect (areas
   accumulating water, but also cold air, were devoid of forest, resulting
   in inverted tree lines), followed by eastness (western slopes had forest
   to higher altitudes). Application of the model in two nearby areas
   showed that the real tree line was lower than the predicted tree line in
   both areas, probably owing mainly to macroclimatic differences in one
   area, and partly also to human land use in the other. The locations with
   the largest deviations could be the focus of further research concerning
   human impacts on tree line vegetation.
   Main conclusions The tree line is located at lower altitudes on
   east-facing slopes, which may be because high levels of radiation are
   received by east-facing slopes in the clear mornings, resulting in the
   photoinhibition of tree seedlings in the paramo. In spite of the
   limitations of the quality and resolution of the remote sensing data,
   the presented method provides indications for important ecological
   factors at the tree line. The method also allows the detection of
   differences in tree line position between areas, which may reflect
   climatic differences or the location of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB The concentration and composition of gangliosides from the brain of
   eight species of Antarctic Notothenioid fishes belonging to the class of
   perciformes and two species of boreal fishes (tropic cichlid fish
   Oreochromis mossambicus: Codfish Gadus morhua) were investigated. The
   concentra tion of whole brain gangliosides in Notothenioid fishes
   (between 1622 and 2183 mu g NeuAc/g dry wt.) was slightly lower than
   that in the brains of fish species, which live in warm, temperate
   habitats (2483 mu g NeuAc/g dry wt.). The composition of brain
   gangliosides was completely different from that of warm adapted fish
   species (e.g. the tropic cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus). The
   relative concentration of polysialogangliosides (GT1b-GH) is strongly
   increased in all the investigated Antarctic species. They were found to
   have the most complex and most polar brain ganglioside pattern (high
   degree of sialylation and alkali-lability) within the teleosts. This may
   be one of the mechanisms, beside antifreeze proteins, to keep the
   neuronal membranes functional even below the freezing point.

AB Neuronal dendritic spines area key component of brain circuitry,
   implicated in many mechanisms for plasticity and long-term stability of
   synaptic communication. They can undergo rapid actin-based
   activity-dependent shape fluctuations, an intriguing biophysical
   property that is believed to alter synaptic transmission. Yet, because
   of their small size (similar to 1 mu m or less) and metastable behavior,
   spines are inaccessible to most physical measurement techniques. Here we
   employ atomic force microscopy elasticity mapping and novel dynamic
   indentation methods to probe the biomechanics of dendritic spines in
   living neurons. We find that spines exhibit 1), a wide range of
   rigidities, correlated with morphological characteristics, axonal
   association, and glutamatergic stimulation, 2), a uniquely large
   viscosity, four to five times that of other cell types, consistent with
   a high density of solubilized proteins, and 3), weak power-law rheology,
   described by the soft-glassy model for cellular mechanics. Our findings
   provide a new perspective on spine functionality and identify key
   mechanical properties that govern the ability of spines to rapidly
   remodel and regulate internal protein trafficking but also maintain
   structural stability.

AB Broad scale climate forcing can interact with local environmental
   processes to affect the observed ecological phenomena. This causes
   potential problems of over-extrapolation for results from a limited
   number of sites or the averaging out of region-specific responses if
   data from too wide an area are combined. In this study, an area similar
   in extent to the Celtic Biscay Large Marine Ecosystem, but including
   off-shelf areas, was partitioned using clustering of satellite
   chlorophyll (chl-a) measurements. The resulting clusters were used to
   define areas over which to combine copepod data from the Continuous
   Plankton Recorder. Following filtering due to data limitations, nine
   regions were defined with sufficient records for analysis. These regions
   were consistent with known oceanographic structure in the study area.
   Off-shelf regions showed a progressively later timing in the seasonal
   peak of chl-a measurements moving northwards. Generalised additive
   models were used to estimate seasonal and multiannual signals in the
   adult and juvenile stages of Calanus finmarchicus, C helgolandicus and
   the Paracalanus-Pseudocalanus group. Associations between variables (sea
   surface temperature (SST), phenology and annual abundance) differed
   among taxonomic groups, but even within taxonomic groups, relationships
   were not consistent across regions. For example, in the deep waters off
   Spain and Portugal the annual abundance of Calanus finmarchicus has a
   weak positive association with SST, in contrast to the pattern in most
   other regions. The regions defined in this study provide an objective
   basis for investigations into the long term dynamics of plankton
   populations and suggest suitable sub regions for deriving pelagic system
   indicators. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyses long-term and seasonal changes in the North Sea
   plankton community during the period 1970 to 2008. Based on Continuous
   Plankton Recorder (CPR) data covering 38 yr, major changes in both
   phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and community structure were
   identified. Regime changes were detected around 1978, 1989 and 1998. The
   first 2 changes have been discussed in the literature and are defined as
   a cold episodic event (1978) and a regime shift towards a warm dynamic
   regime (1989). The effect of these 2 regime changes on plankton
   indicators was assessed and checked against previous studies. The 1998
   change represents a shift in the abundance and seasonal patterns of
   dinoflagellates and the dominant zooplankton group, the neritic
   copepods. Furthermore, environmental factors such as air temperature,
   wind speed and the North Atlantic water inflow were identified as
   potential drivers of change in seasonal patterns, and the most-likely
   environmental causes for detected changes were assessed. We suggest that
   a change in the balance of dissolved nutrients driven by these
   environmental factors was the cause of the latest change in plankton
   community structure, which in turn could have affected the North Sea
   fish community.

AB 1. Surveys of coral reefs in northern Tanzania were conducted in 2004/5
   with the aim of comparing them over an similar to 8-year period during a
   time of increased efforts at fisheries management and the 1998 El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) coral
   mortality event that caused 45% mortality in northern Tanzania and much
   of the Indian Ocean.
   2. Changes associated with both management, its absence, and the ENSO
   were found but changes were generally small and ecological measures
   indicated stability or improvements over this period, particularly when
   compared with reports from much of the northern Indian Ocean.
   3. Fisheries management in two areas increased the biomass of fish and
   benthic communities. A small fisheries closure (0.3 km(2)) displayed
   little change in the coral community but ecological conditions declined
   as measured by sea urchins and fish abundances. This change may be
   associated with its small size because similar changes were not measured
   in the large closure (28 km(2)).
   4. The few sites without any increased management were still degraded
   and one site had experienced a population explosion of a pest sea
   urchin, Echinometra mathaei.
   5. The lack of significant changes across this disturbance indicates
   that these reefs are moderately resilient to climate change and,
   therefore, a high priority for future conservation actions. Copyright

AB Embryos and larvae of the Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri,
   have received considerable experimental attention assessing impacts of
   low temperature on development; however, salinity effects are not well
   documented because heretofore, the Antarctic coastal marine environment
   has been remarkably stenohaline. In this study, subtle decreases of 2
   and 4 parts per 1,000 in standard salinity were tested to see if the
   developmental rate of S. neumayeri embryos would be impacted by a
   potential hyposmotic stress. At 30 psu, significantly fewer embryos (2
   individuals out of 198 tested) reached morula stage by 36 h
   post-fertilization in comparison embryos in control treatments at 34
   psu. Antarctic sea urchins are an important component of marine
   environments due to their grazing activities. Reductions in larval
   recruitment success due to the influx of freshwater from melting ice
   shelves resulting from global climate change could have far-reaching
   impacts on benthic ecosystem structure in Antarctica.

AB Squamates often follow an inverse Bergmann's rule, with larger-bodied
   animals occurring in warmer areas or at lower latitudes. The size of
   dorsal scales in lizards has also been proposed to vary along climatic
   gradients, with species in warmer areas exhibiting larger scales,
   putatively to reduce heat load. We tested for these patterns in the
   diverse and widespread lizard genus Sceloporus. Among 106 species or
   populations, body size was associated positively with maximum
   temperature (consistent with the inverse of Bergmann's rule) and
   aridity, but did not covary with latitude. Scale size (inferred from the
   inverse relation with numbers of scales) was positively related to body
   size. Controlling for body size via multiple regression, scale size was
   associated negatively with latitude (best predictor), positively with
   minimum temperature, and negatively with aridity (similar results were
   obtained using scores from a principal components analysis of latitude
   and climatic indicators). Thus, lizards with larger scales are not
   necessarily found in areas with higher temperatures. Univariate analyses
   indicated phylogenetic signal for body size, scale counts, latitude, and
   all climate indicators. In all cases, phylogenetic regression models fit
   the data significantly better than nonphylogenetic models; thus,
   residuals for log10 number of dorsal scale rows exhibited phylogenetic
   signal.

AB Quasi-one-dimensional microtubules (MTs) in cells enjoy high axial
   rigidity but large transverse flexibility due to the inter-protofilament
   (PF) sliding. This study aims to explore the structure-property relation
   for MTs and examine the relevance of the beam theories to their unique
   features. A molecular structural mechanics (MSM) model was used to
   identify the origin of the inter-PF sliding and its role in bending and
   vibration of MTs. The beam models were then fitted to the MSM to reveal
   how they cope with the distinct mechanical responses induced by the
   inter-PF sliding. Clear evidence showed that the inter-PF sliding is due
   to the soft inter-PF bonds and leads to the length-dependent bending
   stiffness. The Euler beam theory is found to adequately describe MT
   deformation when the inter-PF sliding is largely prohibited.
   Nevertheless, neither shear deformation nor the nonlocal effect
   considered in the 'more accurate' beam theories can fully capture the
   effect of the inter-PF sliding. This reflects the distinct deformation
   mechanisms between an MT and its equivalent continuous body.

AB The Filament Based Lamellipodium Model (FBLM) is a two-phase
   two-dimensional continuum model, describing the dynamics of two
   interacting families of locally parallel actin filaments (Oelz and
   Schmeiser, 2010b). It contains accounts of the filaments' bending
   stiffness, of adhesion to the substrate, and of cross-links connecting
   the two families.
   An extension of the model is presented with contributions from
   nucleation of filaments by branching, from capping, from contraction by
   actin-myosin interaction, and from a pressure-like repulsion between
   parallel filaments due to Coulomb interaction. The effect of a
   chemoattractant is described by a simple signal transduction model
   influencing the polymerization speed. Simulations with the extended
   model show its potential for describing various moving cell shapes,
   depending on the signal transduction procedure, and for predicting
   transients between non-moving and moving states as well as changes of
   direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioural responses to reduce predation risk might cause demographic
   costs of fear'. Costs differ among species, but a conceptual framework
   to understand this variation is lacking. We use a life-history framework
   to tie together diverse traits and life stages to better understand
   interspecific variation in responses and costs. We used natural and
   experimental variation in predation risk to test phenotypic responses
   and associated demographic costs for 10 songbird species. Responses such
   as increased parental attentiveness yielded reduced development time and
   created benefits such as reduced predation probability. Yet, responses
   to increased risk also created demographic costs by reducing offspring
   production in the absence of direct predation. This cost of fear varied
   widely across species, but predictably with the probability of repeat
   breeding. Use of a life-history framework can aid our understanding of
   potential demographic costs from predation, both from responses to
   perceived risk and from direct predation mortality.

AB Virus capsids are primed for disassembly, yet capsid integrity is key to
   generating a protective immune response. Foot-and-mouth disease virus
   (FMDV) capsids comprise identical pentameric protein subunits held
   together by tenuous noncovalent interactions and are often unstable.
   Chemically inactivated or recombinant empty capsids, which could form
   the basis of future vaccines, are even less stable than live virus. Here
   we devised a computational method to assess the relative stability of
   protein-protein interfaces and used it to design improved candidate
   vaccines for two poorly stable, but globally important, serotypes of
   FMDV: O and SAT2. We used a restrained molecular dynamics strategy to
   rank mutations predicted to strengthen the pentamer interfaces and
   applied the results to produce stabilized capsids. Structural analyses
   and stability assays confirmed the predictions, and vaccinated animals
   generated improved neutralizing-antibody responses to stabilized
   particles compared to parental viruses and wild-type capsids.

   of the paleorecord (12.8-7.6 cal ka BP) is composed of laminated
   sediments that may have resulted from turbiditic overflow events,
   whereas occurrences of transported species (e. g. Nonionella sp.,
   Cassidulina carinata) attest of continental influence at the core
   location. After 7.6 cal ka BP, the sediment becomes bioturbated
   concomitantly to the stabilization of the sea-level. The benthic
   foraminiferal fauna is largely dominated by Uvigerina peregrina
   suggesting a high seasonality with seasonal pulsed organic matter fluxes
   to the seafloor. On the other hand, the planktic foraminiferal
   composition indicates that surface water masses were under the influence
   of the polar front in the early record, which retreated at about 11.5
   cal ka BP. The early Holocene is characterized by relatively warm and
   stratified water masses at 8.4-4.8 cal ka BP. The last 4.8 cal ka BP
   records a gradual sea surface water cooling trend and enhanced
   foraminiferal production from similar to 2.6 cal ka BP until present.
   The early (12.8-10.5 cal ka BP) and late (2.3-1.7 cal ka BP) Holocene
   are characterized by the presence of the planktic species
   Globigerinoides ruber probably caused by intrusions of the Iberian
   Poleward Current (IPC), and a negative state of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO).

AB 1. The capacity to perform photosynthesis, given appropriate
   environmental conditions, is reflected by measurements of the maximum
   quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m). The seasonal course of
   F-v/F-m may help define the length of the annual photosynthetic period
   in temperate evergreen forests.
   2. F-v/F-m was measured 31 times from September to May on six conifer
   species located along an altitudinal gradient between 400 and 1400 m
   a.s.l. in northern Idaho, USA. The species were Western Redcedar (Thuja
   plicata Donn ex D. Donn), Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Beissn.)
   Franco), Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry), Grand Fir (Abies
   grandis (Dougl.) Lindl.), Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and
   Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.).
   3. Species differed in mean F-v/F-m, in magnitude of response to maximum
   and minimum temperature, and in altitude effects other than temperature.
   For two species F-v/F-m in spring differed from that in autumn, even
   when measured at the same air temperature. Regardless of temperature,
   most species maintained some photosynthetic capacity all winter.
   4. A lag of several days to 2 months was observed in the response of
   F-v/F-m to ambient temperature. The lag differed among species. It was
   not observed in Grand Fir, and was as long as 2 months in Western
   Redcedar. Over all species combined the best overall correlation was
   with a moving average of maximum temperature over the previous 30 days.
   5. The correlation between F-v/F-m and maximum temperature was generally
   stronger than that with minimum temperature (average root mean-squared
   error was reduced by 10%), presumably because maximum temperatures
   better reflect daytime photoinhibitory conditions.
   6. A reduced model predicted F-v/F-m based on species and maximum
   temperature; this model can be used to parameterize models describing
   the annual cycle of photosynthetic capacity for the six conifer species
   included in this study.

AB Assessing potential future changes in arctic and boreal plant species
   productivity, ecosystem composition, and canopy complexity is essential
   for understanding environmental responses under expected altered climate
   forcing. We examined potential changes in the dominant plant functional
   types (PFTs) of the sedge tundra, shrub tundra, and boreal forest
   ecosystems in ecotonal northern Alaska, USA, for the years 2003-2100. We
   compared energy feedbacks associated with increases in biomass to energy
   feedbacks associated with changes in the duration of the snow-free
   season. We based our simulations on nine input climate scenarios from
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a new version
   of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that incorporates
   biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics for multiple PFTs (e. g., trees,
   shrubs, grasses, sedges, mosses), multiple vegetation pools, and soil
   thermal regimes. We found mean increases in net primary productivity
   (NPP) in all PFTs. Most notably, birch (Betula spp.) in the shrub tundra
   showed increases that were at least three times larger than any other
   PFT. Increases in NPP were positively related to increases in
   growing-season length in the sedge tundra, but PFTs in boreal forest and
   shrub tundra showed a significant response to changes in light
   availability as well as growing-season length. Significant NPP responses
   to changes in vegetation uptake of nitrogen by PFT indicated that some
   PFTs were better competitors for nitrogen than other PFTs. While NPP
   increased, heterotrophic respiration (R-H) also increased, resulting in
   decreases or no change in net ecosystem carbon uptake. Greater
   aboveground biomass from increased NPP produced a decrease in summer
   albedo, greater regional heat absorption (0.34 +/- 0.23 W.m(-2).10
   yr(-1) [mean +/- SD]), and a positive feedback to climate warming.
   However, the decrease in albedo due to a shorter snow season (-5.1 +/-
   1.6 d/10 yr) resulted in much greater regional heat absorption (3.3 +/-
   1.24 W.m(-2).10 yr(-1)) than that associated with increases in
   vegetation. Through quantifying feedbacks associated with changes in
   vegetation and those associated with changes in the snow season length,
   we can reach a more integrated understanding of the manner in which
   climate change may impact interactions between high-latitude ecosystems
   and the climate system.

AB In organisms with complex life cycles, the adaptive value of
   thermotolerance depends on life-history timing and seasonal temperature
   profiles. We illustrate this concept by examining variation in annual
   thermal environments and thermal acclimation among four geographic
   populations of the pitcher plant mosquito. Only diapausing larvae
   experience winter, whereas both postdiapause and nondiapause adults
   occur only during the growing season. Thus, adults experience transient
   cold stress primarily during the spring. We show that adult cold
   tolerance (chill coma recovery) is enhanced in spring-like conditions
   via thermal acclimation but is unaffected by diapause state. Moreover,
   adult mosquitoes from northern populations were more cold tolerant than
   those from southern populations largely because acclimation responses
   were steeper in the north. In contrast to cold tolerance, there was no
   significant acclimation of heat tolerance (heat knockdown), and no
   significant differences in heat tolerance between northern and southern
   populations. Field temperature data show that because of evolved
   differences in diapause timing, adult exposure to cold stress is
   remarkably consistent across geography. This suggests that geographic
   variation in cold tolerance may not be the result of direct selection on
   adults. Our results illustrate the importance of the interplay between
   phenological and thermal adaptation for understanding variation along
   climatic gradients.

AB Geographic variation is characteristic of many physiological traits at
   the population and species levels. However, several recent studies have
   suggested that population-level variation is either limited or that it
   is mostly a consequence of phenotypic plasticity. Here we show that
   there is considerable physiological inertia in cold hardiness, upper
   thermal tolerance limits and desiccation resistance in caterpillars of
   the sub-Antarctic moth Embryonopsis halticella Eaton, such that
   populations from two climatically different islands are physiologically
   very similar, Both populations are moderately chill tolerant, with no
   difference in the supercooling points of caterpillars (-17 to
   -20degreesC). Within their host plants caterpillars of both populations
   freeze at substantially higher, and statistically equivalent
   temperatures (-9.5 to -11.5 degreesC). The populations also have similar
   upper lethal limits (38 degreesC), and survival times of dry conditions
   (6-170 h depending on mass). The previously inexplicably low freezing
   point of caterpillars at the climatically less severe Marion Island
   seems likely a consequence of physiological inertia given that the
   freezing point of caterpillars within their hosts is only a few degrees
   below absolute minima at the older, and colder, Heard Island. Lack of
   adaptive geographic variation in physiological traits has consequences
   for models of range limits, and highlights the importance of exploring
   phenotypic plasticity as a response to climatic variation. (C) 2005

AB Many biochemical networks are robust to variations in network or
   stimulus parameters. Although robustness is considered an important
   design principle of such networks, it is not known whether this
   principle also applies to higher-level biological processes such as
   animal behavior. In thermal gradients, Caenorhabditis elegans uses
   thermotaxis to bias its movement along the direction of the gradient.
   Here we develop a detailed, quantitative map of C. elegans thermotaxis
   and use these data to derive a computational model of thermotaxis in the
   soil, a natural environment of C. elegans. This computational analysis
   indicates that thermotaxis enables animals to avoid temperatures at
   which they cannot reproduce, to limit excursions from their adapted
   temperature, and to remain relatively close to the surface of the soil,
   where oxygen is abundant. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that this
   mechanism is robust to large variations in the parameters governing both
   worm locomotion and temperature fluctuations in the soil. We suggest
   that, similar to biochemical networks, animals evolve behavioral
   strategies that are robust, rather than strategies that rely on fine
   tuning of specific behavioral parameters.

   infectious diseases. Poikilotherms are exposed, as other species, to
   climatic influence, especially due to their physiological peculiarities
   such as important stages of their life cycle: hibernation, shedding, and
   active phase. The immune system serves as an accurate indicator of the
   health status and stress levels in these species. This study aimed to
   monitor the changes of innate (leukocyte subpopulations and total immune
   globulins) and adaptive immunity (in vitro leukocyte blast
   transformation) of two viper species, V. berus berus and V. ammodytes
   ammodytes, endemic in Europe and spread in different regions of Romania
   during their three major life cycles, hibernation, shedding, and active
   phase. The results indicated that seasonal variance and cycle rather

AB In seasonal environments, timing of reproduction is a trait with
   important fitness consequences, but we know little about the molecular
   mechanisms that underlie the variation in this trait. Recently, several
   studies put forward DNA methylation as a mechanism regulating seasonal
   timing of reproduction in both plants and animals. To understand the
   involvement of DNA methylation in seasonal timing of reproduction, it is
   necessary to examine within-individual temporal changes in DNA
   methylation, but such studies are very rare. Here, we use a temporal
   sampling approach to examine changes in DNA methylation throughout the
   breeding season in female great tits (Parus major) that were
   artificially selected for early timing of breeding. These females were
   housed in climate-controlled aviaries and subjected to two contrasting
   temperature treatments. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on
   red blood cell derived DNA showed genome-wide temporal changes in more
   than 40,000 out of the 522,643 CpG sites examined. Although most of
   these changes were relatively small (mean within-individual change of
   6%), the sites that showed a temporal and treatment-specific response in
   DNA methylation are candidate sites of interest for future studies
   trying to understand the link between DNA methylation patterns and
   timing of reproduction.

AB Time between death and discovery of remains, or postmortem interval
   (PMI), can be assessed using blow fly maggot age. Forensic entomologists
   rely on published, often nonlocal, species-specific developmental tables
   to determine maggot age. In a series of common garden experiments, we
   investigated the developmental rate variation between populations of
   Lucilia sericata collected from Sacramento, CA, San Diego, CA, and
   Easton, MA at 16 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 36 degrees C. For the 16
   degrees C trial the time measurement started at egg hatch, while for the
   higher temperatures the experiment began at oviposition; the wandering
   stage signified the endpoint for all experiments. The distribution of
   developmental times differed significantly (ANOVA, p < 0.001) between
   the three populations within each temperature treatment. We discovered
   that regional variation of developmental times within a blow fly species
   exists. This study demonstrates the importance of assembling local
   population-specific developmental tables when estimating larval age to
   determine PMI.

   populations from higher latitudes produced larger eggs when ail were

   evolving at 16.5 degrees C produced larger eggs than populations that
   had evolved at 25 degrees C or 29 degrees C, suggesting that temperature
   may be an important selective agent in producing the latitudinal dines.
   Flies from laboratory populations produced larger eggs at an
   experimental temperature of 16.5 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, and
   there was no indication of genotype-environment interaction for egg
   size. Evolution of egg size in response to temperature cannot be
   accounted for by differences in adult body size between populations. It
   is not clear which life-history traits are direct targets of thermal

AB Paleoclimate of La Guajira, Colombia; by the growth rings of Capparis
   odoratissima (Capparidaceae). There is great concern about the effect of
   climate change in arid and subarid areas of the tropics. Climate change
   combined with other anthropogenic activities such as deforestation,
   fires and over-grazing can accelerate their degradation and,
   consequently, the increases in losses of biological and economic
   productivity. Climate models, both local and global, predict that
   rainfall in the arid Peninsula of La Guajira in the Colombian Caribbean
   would be reduced and temperature would be increased as a result of
   climate change. However, as there are only suitable climate records
   since 1972, it is not possible to verify if, indeed, this is happening.
   To try to verify the hypothesis of reducing rainfall and rising
   temperatures we developed a growth ring chronology of Capparis
   odoratissima in the Middle Peninsula of La Guajira with 17 trees and 45
   series which attain 48 years back. We use standard dendrochronological
   methods that showed statistically significant linear relationship with
   local climatic variables such as air temperature, sea surface
   temperature (SST), annual precipitation and wind speed; we also reach to
   successful relationship of the chronology with global climatic variables
   as the indices SOI and MEI of the ENSO phenomenon. The transfer
   functions estimated with the time series (1955 and 2003) do not showed
   statistically significant trends, indicating that during this period of
   time the annual precipitation or temperatures have not changed. The
   annual nature of C. odoratissima growth rings, the possibility of
   cross-dated among the samples of this species, and the high correlation
   with local and global climatic variables indicate a high potential of
   this species for dendrochronological studies in this part of the
   American continent. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(3): 1389-1405. Epub 2011

AB Sponges belonging to genus Mycale are common and widely distributed
   across the oceans and represent a significant component of benthic
   communities in term of their biomass, which in many species is largely
   composed by bacteria. However, the microbial communities associated with
   Mycale species inhabiting different geographical areas have not been
   previously compared. Here, we provide the first detailed description of
   the microbiota of two Mycale species inhabiting the sub-Antarctic
   Magellan region (53 degrees S) and the Western Antarctic Peninsula
   (62-64 degrees S), two geographically distant areas (> 1,300 km) with
   contrasting environmental conditions. The sponges Mycale (Aegogropila)
   magellanica and Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata are both abundant members of
   benthic communities in the Magellan region and in Antarctica,
   respectively. High throughput sequencing revealed a remarkable
   similarity in the microbiota of both sponge species, dominated by
   Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, with both species sharing more than
   74% of the OTUs. In contrast, 16% and 10% of the OTUs were found only in
   either M. magellanica or M. acerata, respectively. Interestingly,
   despite slight differences in the relative abundance, the most dominant
   OTUs were present in both species, whereas the unique OTUs had very low
   abundances (less than 1% of the total abundance). These results show a
   significant overlap among the microbiota of both Mycale species and also
   suggest the existence of a low level of specificity of the most dominant
   symbiont groups.

AB Two models are presented to test the hypothesis that in aphids, a
   particular constraint (the necessity to resist frost) could be the
   proximal cause for the maintenance of sex. Both models are based on
   temporal variability in winter survival of asexuals.
   They show that:
   i) only cyclical parthenogenesis is maintained below a threshold
   frequency of mild winters, because of the cold-resistance of
   sexually-produced eggs.
   ii) above a second threshold, only obligate parthenogenesis is
   maintained.
   iii) in-between, the first model predicts a mixed evolutionarily stable
   strategy (ESS). This would reflect well the geographic distribution of
   the different types of reproduction. The second model, based on the
   genetic control of the reproduction system in two aphid species,
   predicts the maintenance of polymorphism with fluctuating proportions of
   the two life-cycles. Males produced by obligate parthenogens play an
   essential role in this equilibrium (no stable polymorphism exists if
   this male production is set to zero). The value of the lowest possible
   fitness achieved by overwintering asexuals is critical.

   collected from six sites in northwestern Argentina resolved 44 allozymes
   for 15 loci. Pleurodema cinerea and P. borellii, which are
   morphologically similar, are believed to be reproductively isolated by
   habitat differences. Although the genetic distance was smallest between
   the two P. borellii populations, P. borellii was not genetically distant
   from P. cinerea (average values for Nei's and Rogers' intersite genetic
   distance indices (D) were 0.155 and 0.229, respectively). Pleurodema
   tucumana was genetically distant from both P. cinerea and P. borellii
   (average Nei's D = 1.918; average Rogers' D = 0.799). A comparison of
   mating calls also suggested that P. cinerea and P. borellii are very
   similar to each other. The calls of P. borellii and P. cinerea differed
   only in average pulse rate (100.4 and 59.9 pulses per second,
   respectively) but this difference may have been temperature related. No
   conclusive evidence was found in this study to indicate that P. cinerea
   and P. borellii are distinct species.

AB In the context of global warming, the general trend towards earlier
   flowering dates of many temperate tree species is likely to result in an
   increased risk of damage from exposure to frost. To test this
   hypothesis, a phenological model of apple flowering was applied to a
   temperature series from two locations in an important area for apple
   production in Europe (Trentino, Italy). Two simulated 50-year climatic
   projections (A2 and B2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   - Special Report on Emission Scenarios) from the HadCM3 general
   circulation model were statistically downscaled to the two sites. Hourly
   temperature records over a 40-year period were used as the reference for
   past climate. In the phenological model, the heat requirement (degree
   hours) for flowering was parameterized using two approaches; static
   (constant over time) and dynamic (climate dependent). Parameterisation
   took into account the trees' adaptation to changing temperatures based
   on either past instrumental records or the downscaled outputs from the
   climatic simulations. Flowering dates for the past 40 years and
   simulated flowering dates for the next 50 years were used in the model.
   A significant trend towards earlier flowering was clearly detected in
   the past. This negative trend was also apparent in the simulated data.
   However, the significance was less apparent when the "dynamic" setting
   for the degree hours requirement was used in the model. The number of
   frost episodes and flowering dates, on an annual basis, were graphed to
   assess the risk of spring frost. Risk analysis confirmed a lower risk of
   exposure to frost at present than in the past, and probably either
   constant or a slightly lower risk in future, especially given that
   physiological processes are expected to acclimate to higher
   temperatures.

AB The internal temperature of land snails depends on environmental
   factors, such as exposure to electromagnetic radiation and airflow as
   well as biotic factors including shell size, shell colouration and
   thickness or the resting position of the snail. In controlled field
   experiments, we quantified heating by thermal absorption of light and
   airflow-induced heat loss in the white garden snail, Theba pisana, from
   Normandy, France. Heating experiments revealed a significant positive
   relation of the internal body temperature with illumination period,
   shell temperature and air temperature at different times of day. The
   size of the snails was negatively related with both of the given
   illumination times: smaller animals heated up stronger than larger ones.
   The temperature at the surface of the shell significantly depended on
   the illumination period and the time of day. An AIC-based quality
   assessment of multiple linear modelling showed that, for explaining both
   shell surface and internal temperature of the soft body, several
   factors, i.e., exposure time, daytime, shell size and colouration
   contributed to the best models, respectively. Similarly, heat loss of
   the soft body after and during exposure of the snails to sunlight by a
   constant airflow depended on the initial body temperature, shell size,
   colouration and ambient air temperature. Our study revealed also the
   importance of both shell size and colouration for the loss of body
   temperature under natural conditions: small and banded animals that had
   heated up to temperatures above 30 degrees C cooled down faster than
   large and un-banded ones.

AB The potential link between the microbial dynamics and the environmental
   parameters was investigated in a semi-enclosed and highly dynamic
   coastal system (Gulf of Trieste, northern Adriatic Sea, NE Mediterranean
   Sea). Our comprehensive 2-year time-series study showed that despite the
   shallowness of this area, there was a significant difference between the
   surface and the bottom bacterial community structure. The bottom
   bacterial community was more diverse than the surface one and influenced
   by sediment re-suspension. The surface seawater temperature had a
   profound effect on bacterial productivity, while the bacterial community
   structure was more affected by freshwater-borne nutrients and
   phytoplankton blooms. Phytoplankton blooms caused an increase of
   Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae, SAR86 and Vibrionaceae) and shift
   in dominance from SAR11 to Rhodobacteraceae taxon at the surface. Our
   results propose the importance of the water mass movements as drivers of
   freshwater-borne nutrients and of allochthonous microbial taxa. This
   study emphasizes the prediction power based on association networks
   analyses that are fed with long-term measurements of microbial and
   environmental parameters. These interaction maps offer valuable insights
   into the response of marine ecosystem to climate- and

AB Planktonic foraminifera provide a record of the upper ocean environment
   through their species assemblage and individual tests. To investigate
   the relationship between foraminifera and oceanographic conditions and
   the impact of El Nino on foraminifera, we analyzed foraminiferal fluxes
   and relative abundances by using sediment trap samples collected
   biweekly at three sites in the northwestern North Pacific: Site 40N (39
   degrees 60'N, 165 degrees 00'E), Site KNOT (43 degrees 58'N, 155 degrees
   03'E), and Site SON (50 degrees 01'N, 165 degrees 02'E) from 1998-2001,
   a period that included an El Nino event. Based on foraminiferal
   production and assemblage composition, we divided the sampling duration
   into several periods during which certain characteristic oceanographic
   properties were observed. These sampling periods were classified into
   five types (I-V) based upon four factors: 1) the predominant
   foraminiferal group, 2) total foraminiferal fluxes (TFFs), 3) organic
   matter (OM) fluxes, and 4) hydrographic conditions, which included
   sea-surface temperature (SST) and thermal structure. Our results suggest
   that our observed seasonal changes in foraminifera were closely related
   to water-mass properties in addition to SST. If species compositions
   were the same, then water-mass properties were the most important
   factors affecting the seasonal variation of foraminiferal abundance in
   the northwestern North Pacific. Although one of the major controlling
   factors for foraminiferal fluxes is food availability, the controlling
   factors for each type (Types I-V) are different because of specific
   oceanographic situations, such as phytoplankton blooms, which result in
   an excess food supply for foraminifera. At Site KNOT, high surface
   temperatures and weak winds related to an El Nino period in 1998 would
   have caused a low nutrient supply and water-column stratification, and
   resulted in the relatively low fluxes of total foraminifera,
   Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, and Globigerina bulloides and high fluxes
   of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. The impact of El Nino on foraminifera was
   variable depending on the strength of the El Nino event and site
   location, However, there were some instances of common annual
   foraminiferal patterns; the patterns observed at Sites 40N and KNOT in
   1998 were similar to those observed off Chile in 1997-1998 and in
   1991-1992, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic differences among muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations are
   related to residence in major river drainages, suggesting the existence
   of divergent stocks. By use of radio-telemetry we compared different
   seasonal and diel temperature selection in a southern Illinois reservoir
   for three geographically and genetically distinct stocks of age-2
   muskellunge from throughout the latitudinal range of the species.
   Muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi River drainage were represented
   by the Leech Lake, Minnesota, population and the Ohio River drainage was
   represented by the Cave Run Lake, Kentucky, population. Progeny from
   North Spring Lake, Illinois, an interstock, or mixed-origin stock, were
   also evaluated. No differences in temperature selection were observed
   among stocks of juvenile muskellunge across seasons or diel periods. The
   seasonal mean temperatures of the water varied significantly-spring 21.7
   degrees C, summer 28.4 degrees C, and fall 14.8 degrees C, with an
   overall average temperature of 24.1 degrees C, in agreement with
   previously published values obtained in laboratory trials. This lack of
   different temperature-selection patterns among stocks is in contrast
   with other life-history characteristics, for example growth, metabolism,
   and conversion efficiency, which have been shown to differ among
   populations and stocks.

AB Variations in species morphology and life-history traits strongly
   correlate with geographic and climatic characteristics. Most studies on
   morphological variations in animals focus on ectotherms distributed on a
   large geographic scale across latitudinal and/or altitudinal gradient.
   However, the morphological variations of spiders living in the same
   habitats across different seasons have not been reported. In this study,
   we used the wolf spider, Pardosa astrigera, as a model to determine
   seasonal differences in adult body size, melanism, fecundity, and egg
   diameter both in the overwintering and the first generation for 2010 and
   2016. The results showed that in 2010, both females and males of the
   overwintering generation were significantly darker than the first
   generation. Moreover, the overwintering females were markedly larger and
   produced more and bigger eggs than the first generation in both 2010 and
   2016. Considering the overwintering P.astrigera experiencing low
   temperature and/or desiccation stress, these results suggest that
   substantially darker and larger body of the overwintering generation is
   adaptive to adverse conditions.

AB Organisms in natural environments experience diel temperature
   fluctuations, including sporadic extreme conditions, rather than
   constant temperatures. Studies based mainly on model organisms have
   tended to focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat
   stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations,
   including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here,
   we focus on daily maximum temperatures, while holding night-time
   temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high
   temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain
   aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of
   different daily maximum temperatures with predictions from constant
   temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily maximum
   temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had
   dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical
   maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated
   negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily maximum
   temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures
   overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild
   night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily maximum
   temperature will play an important role in regulating natural population
   dynamics and should be considered in predictions. These findings have
   implications for natural population dynamics, particularly when
   considering the expected increase in extreme temperature events under
   climate change.

AB Owing to its wide European distribution and drought sensitivity, beech
   (Fagus sylvatica L.) has captured the attention of researchers in the
   context of climate change. Contrary to central European beech
   ecosystems, little is known about the nitrogen (N) balance of beech at
   its south-eastern European distribution limit. Here we studied the
   seasonal variation of key N-related parameters during the period
   2003-2004, and tested whether climatic differences between the years
   affected the N balance of beech in north-western Greece. The warmer and
   drier climate of 2003 was characterised by lower soil N availability,
   compared to 2004. The pool of total soluble non-protein nitrogen (TSNN)
   was more sensitive than total N to interannual differences in growth
   conditions, as reflected particularly in the TSNN concentrations, and in
   the composition of phloem and xylem sap in early spring. In 2003, the N
   demands of expanding leaves were covered mainly by stored N
   remobilisation, as indicated by elevated TSNN levels in phloem and xylem
   sap, and by increased loading of arginine and glutamine, major N-storage
   compounds, in these N-exchange and transport pools. By contrast, the
   more favourable growth conditions of 2004 supported new growth also by
   current root N uptake, as indicated by increased asparagine levels in
   phloem and xylem sap.

AB Genetic variation of body size along latitudinal clines is found
   globally in Drosophila melanogaster, with larger individuals encountered
   at higher latitudes. Temperature has been implicated as a selective
   agent for these clines, because the body size of laboratory populations
   allowed to evolve in culture at lower temperatures is larger. In this
   study, we investigated the hypothesis that larger size is favoured at
   lower temperature through natural selection on adult males. We measured
   life-span and age-specific fertility of males from lines of flies
   artificially selected for body size at two different experimental
   temperatures. There was an interaction between experimental temperature
   and body size selection for male fitness; large-line males were fitter
   than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was
   greater at the lower experimental temperature. Smaller males did not
   perform significantly differently from control males at either
   experimental temperature. The results imply that thermal selection for
   larger adult males is at least in part responsible for the evolution of
   larger body size at lower temperatures in this species. The responsible
   mechanisms require further investigation.

   photosynthesis were the major controls on variation in C-13(m) and
   biomass production during this time. By comparison, the lack of a
   significant relationship between C-13(m) and O-18(m) values during 2002,
   2003 and 2006 demonstrated that water stress was not a significant
   limitation on photosynthesis and biomass production in these years.
   Water-use efficiency was higher in 2000 than 1999, consistent with
   expectations because of greater stomatal limitation of photosynthesis
   and lower leaf c(i)/ca during the drier conditions of 2000. Calculated
   values of leaf-scale water-use efficiency were 2-3 times higher than
   ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency, a difference that was likely due
   to carbon lost in root respiration and water lost during soil
   evaporation that was not accounted for by the stable isotope
   measurements.

AB We characterized carbohydrate metabolism following activity in the
   American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, and compared whole body metabolic
   profiles between two seasons. Forty-eight adult male Rana catesbeiana
   were chronically cannulated and injected with [U-14C]L-lactic acid
   sodium salt in either summer (June) or winter (January) after
   acclimation for 2 weeks at 15 degrees C with a 12 h: 12 h L:D
   photoperiod. Following injection with [C-14] lactate, frogs were either
   allowed to rest for 240 min (REST), hopped for 2 min on a treadmill and
   immediately sacrificed (PE), or hopped for 2 min on a treadmill and
   allowed to recover for 240 min (REC 4). Exercise caused a significant
   increase in blood lactate level from 2.7 +/- 0.1 mmol l(-1) at rest to
   17.0 +/- 2.1 mmol l(-1) immediately following exercise. This increase
   persisted throughout the recovery period, with average blood lactate
   level only reduced to 13.7 +/- 1.1 mmol l(-1) after 240 min of recovery,
   despite complete recovery of intramuscular lactate levels. Lactate
   levels were not significantly different between gastrocnemius muscle or
   blood. The vast majority of [C-14] lactate was recovered in the muscle,
   in both winter (86.3%) and summer (87.5%). Season had no effect on total
   amount of C-14 label recovered. [C-14] Lactate was measured in the forms
   of lactate, glucose and glycogen, in the liver and the muscle sampled.
   The most robust difference found in seasonal metabolism was that both
   the liver and the gastrocnemius contained significantly higher levels of
   intracellular free glucose under all treatments in winter. These data
   suggest that, overall, bullfrogs accumulate and slowly clear lactate in
   a manner quite similar to findings in fish, other amphibians and
   lizards. Additionally, our findings indicate that lactate metabolism is
   not highly influenced by season alone, but that intracellular glucose
   levels may be sensitive to annual patterns.

AB Drought and heat stress are two major abiotic stresses that tend to
   co-occur in nature. Recent climate change models predict that the
   frequency and duration of periods of high temperatures and
   moisture-deficits are on the rise and can be detrimental to crop
   production and hence a serious threat for global food security. In this
   study we examined the impact of short-term heat, drought and combined
   heat and drought stress on four barley varieties. These stresses were
   applied during vegetative stage or during heading stages. The impact on
   root and shoot biomass as well as seed yields were analyzed. This study
   demonstrated that sensitivity to combined stress was generally greater
   than heat or drought individually, and greater when imposed at heading
   than at the vegetative stages. Micromalted seeds collected from plants
   stressed during heading showed differences in malt extract, beta-glucan
   content and percent soluble protein. Screening barley germplasm during
   heading stage is recommended to identify novel sources of tolerance to
   combined stress. Apart from seed yield, assessing the seed quality
   traits of concern for the stakeholders and/or consumers should be an
   integral part of breeding programs for developing new barley varieties
   with improved heat and drought stress tolerance.

AB Thermotolerant crop research.
   Global warming has become a serious worldwide threat. High temperature
   is a major environmental factor limiting crop productivity. Current
   adaptations to high temperature via alterations to technical and
   management systems are insufficient to sustain yield. For this reason,
   breeding for heat-tolerant crops is in high demand. This review provides
   an overview of the effects of high temperature on plant physiology,
   fertility and crop yield and discusses the strategies for breeding
   heat-tolerant cultivars. Generating thermotolerant crops seems to be a
   challenging task as heat sensitivity is highly variable across
   developmental stages and processes. In response to heat, plants trigger
   a cascade of events, switching on numerous genes. Although breeding has
   made substantial advances in developing heat-tolerant lines, the genetic
   basis and diversity of heat tolerance in plants remain largely unknown.
   The development of new varieties is expensive and time-consuming, and
   knowledge of heat tolerance mechanisms would aid the design of
   strategies to screen germplasm for heat tolerance traits. However, gains
   in heat tolerance are limited by the often narrow genetic diversity.
   Exploration and use of wild relatives and landraces in breeding can
   increase useful genetic diversity in current crops. Due to the complex
   nature of plant heat tolerance and its immediate global concern, it is
   essential to face this breeding challenge in a multidisciplinary
   holistic approach involving governmental agencies, private companies and
   academic institutions.

AB Thermal performance curves are widely used to describe how ambient
   temperature impacts different attributes of ectothermic organisms, from
   protein function to life-history traits, and to predict the potential
   effects of global warming on ecological systems. Nonetheless, from an
   analytical standpoint, they remain primarily heuristic and few attempts
   have been made to develop a formal framework to characterize these
   curves and disentangle which factors contribute to their variation. Here
   we employ a nonlinear regression approach to assess if they vary
   systematically in shape depending on the performance proxy of choice. We
   compare curves at contrasting levels of organization, namely
   photosynthetic rates in plants (n = 43), running speeds in lizards (n =
   51) and intrinsic rates of population increase in insects (n = 47), and
   show with discriminant analyses that differences lie in a single
   dimension accounting for 99.1% of the variation, resulting in 75.8% of
   classification accuracy. Differences revolve primarily around the
   thermal range for elevated performance (greater than or equal to 50% of
   maximum performance), which is broader for photosynthetic rates (median
   of 26.48 degrees C), intermediate for running speeds (19.58 degrees C)
   and narrower for intrinsic rates of increase (12.58 degrees C). We
   contend, confounding taxonomic factors aside, that these differences
   reflect contrasting levels of biological organization, and hypothesize
   that the thermal range for elevated performance should decrease at
   higher organization levels. In this scenario, instantaneous or
   short-term measures of performance may grossly overestimate the thermal
   safety margins for population growth and reproduction. Taken together,
   our analyses suggest that descriptors of the curve are highly correlated
   and respond in tandem, potentially resulting in systematic variation in
   shape across organization levels. Future studies should take into
   consideration this potential bias, address if it constitutes a general
   pattern and, if so, explain why and how it emerges.

   biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses

AB 1. Tanytarsus gracilentus population dynamics in Lake Myvatn show a
   tendency to cycle, with three oscillations occurring between 1977 and
   1999 having periods of roughly 7 years. The population abundance
   fluctuated over four orders of magnitude.
   2. A partial autocorrelation function (PACF) accounting for measurement
   error revealed a strong positive lag-1 autocorrelation and a moderate
   negative lag-2 partial autocorrelation. This suggests that the dynamics
   can be explained by a simple second-order autoregressive process.
   3. We tested the alternative hypotheses that the cyclic dynamics of T
   gracilentus were driven by consumer-resource interactions in which T
   gracilentus is the consumer, or predator-prey interactions in which T
   gracilentus is the prey We analysed autoregressive models including both
   consumer-resource interactions and predator-prey interactions.
   4. Wing length of T gracilentus was used as a surrogate for resource
   abundance and/or quality, because body size is known to fluctuate with
   resource. abundance and quality in dipterans. Furthermore, the wing
   lengths of Micropsectra lindrothi, a species ecologically similar to T
   gracilentus, fluctuated synchronously with T gracilentus wing lengths,
   thereby indicating that the shared resources of these two species were
   indeed cycling. Wing lengths of other chironomid species were not
   synchronized.
   5. The predators of T gracilentus included midges in the genera
   Procladius and Macropelopia, and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus
   (three-spined stickleback).
   6. The autoregressive models supported the hypothesis that T gracilentus
   dynamics were driven by consumer-resource interactions, and rejected the
   hypothesis that the dynamics were driven by predator-prey interactions.
   7. The models also revealed the consequences of consumer-resource
   interactions for the magnitude of fluctuations in T gracilentus
   abundance. Consumer-resource interactions amplified the exogenous
   variability affecting T gracilentus per capita population growth rates
   (e.g. temperature, rainfall, etc.), leading to variability in abundance
   more than two orders of magnitude greater than the exogenous
   variability.

AB Five winter oilseed rape cultivars (Benefit, Californium, Cortes,
   Ladoga, Navajo) were subjected to 30 days of cold treatment (4 degrees
   C) to examine the effect of cold on acquired frost tolerance (FT),
   dehydrin (DHN) content, and photosynthesis-related parameters. The main
   aim of this study was to determine whether there are relationships
   between FT (expressed as LT50 values) and the other parameters measured
   in the cultivars. While the cultivar Benefit accumulated two types of
   DHNs (045 and D35), the other cultivars accumulated three additional
   DHNs (D97, D47, and D37). The similar-sized DHNs (D45 and D47) were the
   most abundant; the others exhibited significantly lower accumulations.
   The highest correlations were detected between LT50 and DHN accumulation
   (r= 0.815), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi; r= 0.643), net
   photosynthetic rate (r= 0.628), stomatal conductance (r= 0.511), and
   intracellular/intercellular CO2 concentration (r= 0.505). Those
   cultivars that exhibited higher Pn rate in cold (and further a
   significant increase in WUEi) had higher levels of DHNs and also higher
   FT. No significant correlation was observed between LT50 and E, PRI, or
   NDVI. Overall, we have shown the selected physiological parameters to be
   able to distinguish different FT cultivars of wiriter oilseed rape.(C)

AB Co-occurrence in food requirements of offspring and food availability is
   a key factor determining breeding success. Prey availability is
   typically dependent on environmental conditions that are different from
   those influencing the predator's decision regarding whether or not to
   initiate breeding, and is not always optimal at the peak of reproduction
   requirements. We investigated this relationship to understand better
   what determines the fledging success of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula
   arctica). Colony data from Rost (northern Norway) covering a period of
   27 years were analysed with parallel data on sea temperature and the
   size and abundance of the puffins' main prey (the Norwegian
   spring-spawning herring, Clupea harengus). By fitting statistical models
   to the fledging success, we found that one effect of climate on this
   population of Atlantic puffins is indirect and mediated by sea
   temperature affecting the availability of first-year herring. The best
   model also demonstrates that the breeding success of the Rost puffins
   may be quantitatively predicted from the size of first-year herring and
   sea temperature.

AB Global warming has advanced the timing of biological events, potentially
   leading to disruption across trophic levels. The potential importance of
   phenological change as a driver of population trends has been suggested.
   To fully understand the possible impacts, there is a need to quantify
   the scale of these changes spatially and according to habitat type. We
   studied the relationship between phenological trends, space and habitat
   type between 1965 and 2012 using an extensive UK dataset comprising 269
   aphid, bird, butterfly and moth species. We modelled phenologies using
   generalized additive mixed models that included covariates for
   geographical (latitude, longitude, altitude), temporal (year, season)
   and habitat terms (woodland, scrub, grassland). Model selection showed
   that a baseline model with geographical and temporal components
   explained the variation in phenologies better than either a model in
   which space and time interacted or a habitat model without spatial
   terms. This baseline model showed strongly that phenologies shifted
   progressively earlier over time, that increasing altitude produced later
   phenologies and that a strong spatial component determined phenological
   timings, particularly latitude. The seasonal timing of a phenological
   event, in terms of whether it fell in the first or second half of the
   year, did not result in substantially different trends for butterflies.
   For moths, early season phenologies advanced more rapidly than those
   recorded later. Whilst temporal trends across all habitats resulted in
   earlier phenologies over time, agricultural habitats produced
   significantly later phenologies than most other habitats studied,
   probably because of nonclimatic drivers. A model with a significant
   habitat-time interaction was the best-fitting model for birds, moths and
   butterflies, emphasizing that the rates of phenological advance also
   differ among habitats for these groups. Our results suggest the presence
   of strong spatial gradients in mean seasonal timing and nonlinear trends
   towards earlier seasonal timing that varies in form and rate among
   habitat types.

AB Geographic body size variation was analysed in males and females of 19
   populations of the South American grasshopper Dichroplus vittatus Bruner
   spanning 20 degrees of latitude and 2700 m of altitude. Using mean and
   maximum body length of each sex and factors obtained from principal
   components analyses of six morphometric linear characters it was shown
   that D. vittatus followed the converse to Bergmann's rule latitudinally
   but not altitudinally where no significant trends were observed. For
   males, variability of body size increased with latitude but not with
   altitude. Both types of trends were significantly correlated with mean
   annual temperature and minimum annual temperature (positive
   correlations), and two estimators of seasonality, the coefficients of
   variation of mean annual temperature (negative) and mean annual
   precipitation (positive). Some allometric relationships also showed
   geographic variation. it is suggested that the observed decrease in size
   with latitude together with the increase in morphological variability is
   a consequence of a number of factors: the shortening of the growing
   season southwards; the increasing seasonality and climatic
   unpredictability; and the fact that the species exhibits protandry which
   contributes to smaller and more variable size in males and smaller but
   more constant body size in females.

   being exposed to seasonal weather extremes during sensitive life stages
   and losing synchrony with biotic resources. Additionally, warming may
   result in loss of developmental synchronization within a population
   making it difficult to find mates or mount mass attacks against
   well-defended resources at low population densities. It is unknown
   whether genetic evolution of development time can occur rapidly enough
   to moderate these effects. We present a novel approach to modeling the
   evolution of phenology by allowing the parameters of a phenology model
   to evolve in response to selection on emergence time and density. We use
   the Laplace method to find asymptotic approximations for the temporal
   variation in mean phenotype and phenotypic variance arising in the
   evolution model that are used to characterize invariant distributions of
   the model under periodic temperatures at leading order. At these steady
   distributions the mean phenotype allows for parents and offspring to be
   oviposited at the same time of year in consecutive years. Numerical
   simulations show that populations evolve to these steady distributions
   under periodic temperatures. We consider an example of how the evolution
   model predicts populations will evolve in response to warming
   temperatures and shifting resource phenology.

AB It is generally accepted that populations of most species experience
   some level of density dependence: however, this has rarely been shown
   for soil-dwelling invertebrate species, in particular for earthworms.
   Experimental data, mostly obtained at high laboratory densities, suggest
   intense intraspecific competition for resources and/or living space and
   density-dependent dynamics in earthworm populations, irrespective of
   their ecological group affiliation. In the present study performed in
   large field microcosms, I investigated whether density-dependent
   responses occur within the earthworm density gradients more realistic
   for the natural sites. Five lumbricid species from epigeic (Dendrobaena
   octaedra, Lumbricus rubellus), endogeic (Allolobophora chlorotica,
   Aporrectodea caliginosa) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) ecological
   groups were tested. Soil systems populated with earthworm monocultures
   in large (20-L) microcosms were exposed in a beech-oak forest for 4.5
   months; each species was represented by two (L. terrestris) or three
   treatments forming gradients of increasing density. In two endogeic
   species, manifold and generally similar density-dependent responses (a
   retardation of growth, maturation and reproduction rates, but higher
   mortality rates with density increase) were revealed, likely explained
   by spatial competition rather than by direct food competition. In each
   of epigeic species density-dependent responses were less variable and
   more species-specific. In contrast to endogeics, direct food competition
   was presumably a more important cause of density-dependence. In L.
   terrestris no significant density-dependent responses in adult
   earthworms were revealed; however, they need to be further investigated
   in relation to the age and territorial behaviour of individual
   earthworms. Importantly, in any earthworm species the density variations
   in the reproducing generation had significant consequences for the
   advancing generation, affecting either the numbers or/and the size
   (individual weight) of the cocoons produced. It is suggested that an
   underestimation of density dependent processes may cause inaccurate
   estimates of the activities of local lumbricid populations. (C) 2017

AB Mediterranean shrublands are generally water-limited and fire-driven
   ecosystems. Seed-based post-fire regeneration may be affected by varying
   rainfall patterns, depending on species sensitivity to germinate under
   water stress. In our study, we considered the germination response to
   water stress in four species from several sites across the Mediterranean
   Basin. Seeds of species with a hard coat (Cistus monspeliensis,
   C.salviifolius, Cistaceae, Calicotome villosa, Fabaceae) or soft coat
   (Erica arborea, Ericaceae), which were exposed or not to a heat shock
   and smoke (fire cues), were made to germinate under water stress. Final
   germination percentage, germination speed and viability of seeds were
   recorded. Germination was modelled using hydrotime analysis and
   correlated to the water balance characteristics of seed provenance.
   Water stress was found to decrease final germination in the three
   hard-seeded species, as well as reduce germination speed. Moreover, an
   interaction between fire cues and water stress was found, whereby fire
   cues increased sensitivity to water stress. Seed viability after
   germination under water stress also declined in two hard-seeded species.
   Conversely, E.arborea showed little sensitivity to water stress,
   independent of fire cues. Germination responses varied among populations
   of all species, and hydrotime parameters were not correlated to site
   water balance, except in E.arborea when not exposed to fire cues. In
   conclusion, the species studied differed in germination sensitivity to
   water stress; furthermore, fire cues increased this sensitivity in the
   three hard-seeded species, but not in E.arborea. Moreover, populations
   within species consistently differed among themselves, but these
   differences could only be related to the provenance locality in
   E.arborea in seeds not exposed to fire cues.

AB Phytoplankton community structure at the Cariaco Basin Time-Series site
   (10 degrees 30'N, 64 degrees 40'W) within the Cariaco Basin was examined
   using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microscopy
   between January 1996 to October 2000, and July 2006 to December 2010.
   Microscopy results from the upper 55 m indicated that the abundance of
   microphytoplankton (> 20 mu m) decreased by more than 5-fold from 1996
   through 2010, accompanied by a change in diatom composition and a 4-fold
   reduction in large diatom cell numbers, particularly during upwelling
   periods. HPLC results also indicate a decline in diatoms, but not nearly
   to the same extent. Rather, HPLC data suggests a substantial
   reorganization of the phytoplankton community. Between the two time
   periods, there was a significant deepening of high biomass
   concentrations from near surface waters to depths below 55 m. At the
   same time, phytoplankton diversity increased by 14%, while seasonal
   variability in community composition declined. Vertical photopigment
   distributions of nanophytoplankton (< 20 mu m) further showed
   significant overall increases in coccolithophore, cryptophyte, and other
   phytoflagellate concentrations. The deepening in phytoplankton biomass
   below the mixed layer, the relative increase in smaller taxa, and the
   increasing homogeneity in phytoplankton distributions over time are
   likely a direct response to a reduction in upwelling intensity and a
   deepening of the euphotic zone associated with a decrease in the average
   trade winds of the region from 2006-2010, compared to 1996-2000.
   Surprisingly, the overall decline in large cells dominated by diatoms
   and an increase in smaller taxa has led to no significant change in the
   export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to depth, contrary to many
   studies that predict increasing stratification with future climate
   change scenarios will reduce POC export and carbon sequestration in the
   deep ocean. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Western US ponderosa pine forests have recently suffered extensive
   stand-replacing fires followed by hillslope erosion and
   sedimentation(1-4). These fires are usually attributed to increased
   stand density as a result of fire suppression, grazing and other land
   use, and are often considered uncharacteristic or unprecedented(1-3).
   Tree-ring records from the past 500 years indicate that before
   Euro-American settlement, frequent, low-severity fires maintained open
   stands(1-3). However, the pre-settlement period between about AD 1500
   and AD 1900 was also generally colder than present(5-10), raising the
   possibility that rapid twentieth-century warming promoted recent
   catastrophic fires. Here we date fire-related sediment deposits in
   alluvial fans in central Idaho to reconstruct Holocene fire history in
   xeric ponderosa pine forests and examine links to climate. We find that
   colder periods experienced frequent low-severity fires, probably fuelled
   by increased understory growth. Warmer periods experienced severe
   droughts, stand-replacing fires and large debris-flow events that
   comprise a large component of long-term erosion(11) and coincide with
   similar events in sub-alpine forests of Yellowstone National Park(12).
   Our results suggest that given the powerful influence of climate,
   restoration of processes typical of pre-settlement times may be
   difficult in a warmer future that promotes severe fires.

AB Winter chilling is of central importance in the phenology of temperate
   annual and perennial plants. Chilling accelerates flowering through the
   process of vernalization and breaks both bud and seed dormancy,
   permitting the onset of growth in the spring. The quantitative effects
   of chilling in floral promotion in winter annual Arabidopsis accessions
   are well-documented, but very little is known about the basic physiology
   underlying summer annual responses to winter chilling, which acts on
   seeds within the soil seed bank. Here, we analyse the response of wild
   accessions to extended chilling in seeds, and explore the interaction
   between seed-maturation temperature and chilling responses. We show that
   two weeks of chilling induces secondary dormancy, and that this time
   period is not dependent on seed-maturation temperature. In addition, we
   found that seeds for most accessions set under simulated summer
   conditions in the laboratory are unable to overwinter in the soil seed
   bank, as they germinate without light during extended chilling
   treatments. This shows that these seeds are committed to
   re-establishment in the same growing season. Understanding how winter
   chilling affects the timing of Arabidopsis phenology will enable us to
   explore the genetics behind adaptation to changing climates, and inform
   rational approaches to breeding crops with improved performance under
   new climate scenarios and develop a systems ecology of Arabidopsis.

AB Background: The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), vector of several
   emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as
   into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of
   distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of
   infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore,
   predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is
   essential for planning early prevention and control strategies.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify the areas currently most
   suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of
   Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of
   satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and
   human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the
   survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January
   mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0
   degrees C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11 degrees
   C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for
   identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this
   mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human
   settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito
   distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future
   establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted
   climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically
   downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures
   increase by 1.5 and 1 degrees C, respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance: MODIS satellite LST data are useful for
   accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and
   for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas,
   predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that
   the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change
   could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas.

   Mexico. Between 1400 and 1500 A.D., oxygen isotope ratios of ostracod
   and gastropod carbonate increased by an average of 2.2 parts per
   thousand and the benthic foraminifer Ammonia beccarii parkinsoniana
   appeared in the sediment profile, indicating a hydrologic change that
   included increased lake water salinity. Pollen from a core in nearby
   Cenote San Jose Chulchaca showed a decrease in mesic forest taxa during
   the same period. Oxygen isotopes of shell carbonate in sediment cores
   from Lakes Chichancanab (19 degrees 53.0'N, 88 degrees 46.0'W) and
   Salpeten (16 degrees 58.6'N, 89 degrees 40.5'W) to the south also
   increased in the mid-15th century, but less so than in Aguada X'caamal.
   Climate change in the 15th century is also supported by historical
   accounts of cold and famine described in Maya and Aztec chronicles. We
   conclude that climate became drier on the Yucatan Peninsula in the 15th
   century A.D. near the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Comparison of
   results from the Yucatan Peninsula with other circum-Caribbean
   paleoclimate records indicates a coherent climate response for this
   region at the beginning of the LIA. At that time, sea surface
   temperatures cooled and aridity in the circum-Caribbean region
   increased. (c) 2004 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores in evaporated milk
   constitutes an important quality problem for the milk industry. This
   study was undertaken to provide an approach in modelling the effect of
   temperature on G. stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 growth and in predicting
   spoilage of evaporated milk. The growth of G. stearothermophilus was
   monitored in tryptone soy broth at isothermal conditions (35-67 degrees
   C). The data derived were used to model the effect of temperature on G.
   stearothermophilus growth with a cardinal type model. The cardinal
   values of the model for the maximum specific growth rate were T-min =
   33.76 degrees C, T-max = 68.14 degrees C, T-opt = 61.82 degrees C and
   mu(opt) = 2.068/h. The growth of G. stearothermophilus was assessed in
   evaporated milk at T-opt in order to adjust the model to milk. The
   efficiency of the model in predicting G. stearothermophilus growth at
   non-isothermal conditions was evaluated by comparing predictions with
   observed growth under dynamic conditions and the results showed a good
   performance of the model. The model was further used to predict the
   time-to-spoilage (tts) of evaporated milk. The spoilage of this product
   caused by acid coagulation when the pH approached a level around 5.2,
   eight generations after G. stearothermophilus reached the maximum
   population density (N-max). Based on the above, the tts was predicted
   from the growth model as the sum of the time required for the
   microorganism to multiply from the initial to the maximum level
   (t(Nmax)), plus the time required after the t(Nmax) to complete eight
   generations. The observed tts was very close to the predicted one
   indicating that the model is able to describe satisfactorily the growth
   of G. stearothermophilus and to provide realistic predictions for
   evaporated milk spoilage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Geographic variation in human nasal form has often been
   interpreted as a climatic adaptation, owing to the nasal
   air-conditioning function. The aim of this study was to further address
   morphofunctional issues of the nasal cavity, using three human groups
   from subarctic, temperate, and subtropical regions of the Japanese
   Archipelago: prehistoric Okhotsk, early-modern Honshu and Okinawa
   groups.
   Methods: Using three-dimensional coordinates of craniometric landmarks
   surrounding the nasal cavity, we compared linear measurements regarding
   nasal cavity form among the three groups and also conducted 3D geometric
   morphometrics.
   Results: Both linear measurements and morphometric analyses corroborate
   the previously reported covariation pattern of nasal cavity shape with
   climate, where humans from a cold/dry climate tend to possess a
   relatively tall, narrow, and deep nasal cavity compared with those from
   a warm/humid environment. The northern Okhotsk group had overall larger
   cranial airways, which may be attributable to their large facial
   skeleton. However, the ratio of nasal/bimaxillary breadth was
   significantly lower in the Okhotsk group, indicating that maxillary size
   does not necessarily constrain the nasal breadth. In addition, despite
   the presence of obvious geographic clines in anterior nasal shape,
   posterior choanal shape lacked the north-south geographic cline. This
   suggests a certain level of morphofunctional independence between the
   anterior and posterior nasal openings.
   Conclusions: The observed geographic variations must, however, be partly
   considered as a reflection of different ancestral traits and population
   histories of the three groups. Nevertheless, the results indicate that
   intergroup variations in nasal cavity morphology can be largely
   explained by climatic conditions. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The life cycle of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) presents several
   distinctive features, such as high plasticity in body growth, marked
   sexual dimorphism, sex ratio strongly skewed in favor of females and
   sexual maturation largely dependent upon the size of individuals. A
   demographic model incorporating all these characteristics is derived on
   the basis of a multiple classification of individuals by age and size,
   and variability in individual growth is explicitly included. Existing
   theory for size-structured stocks is extended to include the dependence
   of sexual maturation on size, while natural mortality is age specific.
   Using 1989 population data from Comacchio lagoons (Italy), we estimate
   mortality and metamorphosis rate and abundance in each age- and
   size-class for both yellow and silver eels, crucial information for the
   management of the Comacchio fishery. The use of a nonparametric
   technique (bootstrapping) yields not only the moments, but also the
   distributions of these estimates. Validation of the model is performed
   on the data collected in 1990. The approach adopted is very flexible and
   different assumptions about survival, sexual maturation, and net
   selectivity can be easily incorporated in the model.

AB Gloger's rule is an ecogeographical rule that links animal colouration
   with climatic variation. This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was
   one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic
   variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and
   mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term 'Gloger's
   rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of
   variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two
   ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to
   be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of
   melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential
   effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin
   pigments - eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted
   to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low
   temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and
   warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of
   the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion
   in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define
   the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a
   quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of
   Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention
   only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of
   studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and
   environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar
   radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition
   (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the
   qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N =
   38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's
   rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence
   supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked
   variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature.
   Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as
   the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This
   suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined
   may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in
   terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are
   needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases.
   In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to
   Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring
   to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the
   validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and
   establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes.
   Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's
   rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage
   and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through
   pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes
   that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights
   into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change.

AB Body size is important to most aspects of biology and is also one of the
   most labile traits. Despite its importance we know remarkably little
   about the proximate (developmental) factors that determine body size
   under different circumstances. Here, I review what is known about how
   cell size and number contribute to phenetic and genetic variation in
   body size in Drosophila melanogaster, several fish, and fruits and
   leaves of some angiosperms. Variation in resources influences size
   primarily through changes in cell number while temperature acts through
   cell size. The difference in cellular mechanism may also explain the
   differences in growth trajectories resulting from food and temperature
   manipulations. There is, however, a poorly recognized interaction
   between food and temperature effects that needs further study. In
   addition, flies show a sexual dimorphism in temperature effects with the
   larger sex responding by changes in cell size and the smaller sex
   showing changes in both cell size and number. Leaf size is more variable
   than other organs, but there appears to be a consistent difference
   between how shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species respond to light
   level. The former have larger leaves via cell size under shade, the
   latter via cell number in light conditions. Genetic differences,
   primarily from comparisons of D. melanogaster, show similar variation.
   Direct selection on body size alters cell number only, while temperature
   selection results in increased cell size and decreased cell number.
   Population comparisons along latitudinal clines show that larger flies
   have both larger cells and more cells. Use of these proximate patterns
   can give clues as to how selection acts in the wild. For example, the
   latitudinal pattern in D. melanogaster is usually assumed to be due to
   temperature, but the cellular pattern does not match that seen in
   laboratory selection at different temperatures.

AB Despite being endangered internationally and protected nationally,
   little consideration has been given to the occurrence of green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas) in New Zealand. New Zealand lies on the southern
   boundary of the distributional range of green turtles in the
   southwestern Pacific, with individuals found within these waters
   historically considered to be occasional visitors or stragglers
   incidentally carried by ocean currents. However, the present work shows
   that green turtles are present year round in New Zealand's northern
   waters (c. 34 degrees-38 degrees S). A review of sighting, stranding and
   incidental capture data collected between 1895 and 2013 illustrate New
   Zealand's green turtle population comprises post-pelagic immature
   juveniles to large subadults. The female:male sex ratio of 1.7:1 is
   similar to those reported from warm temperate foraging grounds in
   eastern Australia. A subsample of new recruits indicates green turtles
   recruit to neritic habitats at approximately 40.8cm curved carapace
   length. This study suggests that New Zealand's neritic habitats
   constitute a transitional developmental ground for post-pelagic immature
   green turtles. We observed an exponential increase in the number of
   documented records over time, though whether this is due to increased
   numbers of turtles or increased reporting rates, or both, is unclear and
   warrants further investigation. More broadly, this work provides a
   baseline understanding of the ecology of green turtles at the edge of
   their range, providing opportunities to investigate regional niche
   modelling and connectivity of this highly mobile species, while also
   monitoring broad-scale effects of climate-induced environmental change.

AB The high-yielding indica rice variety, 'Takanari', has the high rate of
   leaf photosynthesis compared with the commercial japonica varieties.
   Among backcrossed inbred lines from a cross between 'Takanari' and a
   japonica variety, 'Koshihikari', two lines, BTK-a and BTK-b, showed
   approximately 20% higher photosynthetic rate than that of 'Takanari' for
   a flag leaf at full heading. This is a highest recorded rate of rice
   leaf photosynthesis. Here, the timing and cause of the increased leaf
   photosynthesis in the BTK lines were investigated by examining the
   photosynthesis and related parameters, as well as mesophyll cell anatomy
   during ontogenesis. Their photosynthetic rate was greater than that of
   'Takanari' in the 13th leaf, as well as the flag leaf, but there were no
   differences in the 7th and 10th leaves. There were no consistent
   differences in the stomatal conductance, or the leaf nitrogen and
   Rubisco contents in the 13th and flag leaves. The total surface area of
   mesophyll cells per leaf area (TA(mes)) in the 13th and flag leaves
   increased significantly in the BTK lines due to the increased number and
   developed lobes of mesophyll cells compared with in 'Takanari'. The
   mesophyll conductance (g (m)) became greater in the BTK lines compared
   with 'Takanari' in the flag leaves but not in the 10th leaves. A close
   correlation was observed between TA(mes) and g (m). We concluded that
   the increased mesophyll conductance through the development of mesophyll
   cells during the reproductive period is a probable cause of the greater
   photosynthetic rate in the BTK lines.

AB Understanding the potential for organisms to tolerate thermal stress
   through physiological or evolutionary responses is crucial given rapid
   climate change. Although climate models predict increases in both
   temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed
   under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature
   variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly
   Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm
   and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated
   heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive
   success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C)
   fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool
   fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations
   reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under
   warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees
   C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar
   fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was
   substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive
   success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments
   reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may
   constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins. Our data
   suggest that even small increases in temperature variability will
   threaten tropical ectotherms living close to their upper thermal limits,
   both through direct effects on fitness and by limiting their adaptive
   potential.

AB The planktonic copepod Acartia hudsonica apparently requires summer
   diapause or dormancy to persist in Narragansett Bay, RI. In estuaries to
   the north, however, active A. hudsonica populations are present
   year-round and may not express dormancy. Using a full-sibling rearing
   design and analysis of variance (ANOVA), I assessed the importance of
   phenotypic and genetic sources of variation in two geographically
   separate populations, one from Maine and one from Rhode Island. Both
   populations showed phenotypic plasticity in the percentage of dormant
   eggs produced. Moreover, experiments revealed significant
   sibship-environment interactions in both populations, indicating that
   the phenotypic plasticity has a genetic component. Both populations also
   revealed a significant amount of genetic variation in the percentage of
   dormant eggs produced. For the Maine population, broad sense
   heritability was high (0.91, 1.10) in two short-day (12L:12D) treatments
   and near zero (0.08) in the long-day treatment (15L:9D). For a Rhode
   Island population, broad sense heritability was higher (0.95) in a
   low-temperature short-day treatment (13.5 degreesC, 12L: 12D) than in a
   high-temperature short-day treatment (17.5 degreesC, 12L: 12D;

AB The rapid accumulation of pre-existing mutations may play major roles in
   the establishment and shaping of adaptability for local regions in

   The cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L., which originated from tropical
   regions, is now grown worldwide due to the concerted efforts of breeding
   programs. However, the process of establishing local populations and
   their origins remain unclear. In the present study, we characterized DNA
   polymorphisms in the rice variety KITAAKE from Hokkaido, one of the
   northern limits of rice cultivation in the world. Indel polymorphisms
   were attributed to transposable element-like insertions, tandem
   duplications, and non-TE deletions as the original mutation events in
   the NIPPONBARE and KITAAKE genomes. The allele frequencies of the
   KITAAKE alleles markedly shifted to the current variety types among the
   local population from Hokkaido in the last two decades. The KITAAKE
   alleles widely distributed throughout wild rice and cultivated rice over
   the world. These have accumulated in the local population from Hokkaido
   via Japanese landraces as the ancestral population of Hokkaido. These
   results strongly suggested that combinations of pre-existing mutations
   played a role in the establishment of adaptability. This approach using
   the re-sequencing of local varieties in unique environmental conditions
   will be useful as a genetic resource in plant breeding programs in local
   regions.

AB Male reproductive tract degenerative syndrome in shrimp is a condition
   associated with the melanisation and degradation of sperm housed in the
   spermatophores. While it has been suggested that this condition is
   associated with a number of external factors including temperature, diet
   and microbial infection, the cause of this condition is still unclear.
   This current study examines if the melanisation of the spermatophores
   may be a result of an auto-immune condition during which the spermatozoa
   are recognised as 'foreign' by the shrimp's immune system. Initial
   studies examined the morphology of spermatozoa extracted from normal and
   heavily melanised spermatophores. A larger percentage of abnormal sperm
   were found in the melanised compared with the normal spermatophores.
   There was no indication of any bacterial infection associated with the
   melanised spermatophores ruling this out as a potential trigger for the
   syndrome. Incubation of apparently healthy sperm from non-melanised
   spermatophores with blood cells (haemocytes) showed little interaction
   while incubation of abnormal sperm from animals with the syndrome with
   haemocytes resulted in their phagocytosis. Histological analysis of
   melanised spermatophores revealed the presence of abnormal sperm
   together with melanised and non-melanised amorphous debris but there was
   no indication of any haemocyte infiltration or general host reaction to
   the presence of these abnormal cells in vivo. Overall, although in vitro
   experiments indicated that damaged sperm together with attendant
   amorphous debris is apparently recognised as foreign leading to its
   engulfment by phagocytic haemocytes, such interaction was not observed
   in vivo. The possible reasons for this disparity are discussed. (C) 2008

AB Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a
   variety of factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and
   nutritional requirements. Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral
   and physiological adaptations related to thermoregulation and sharp,
   seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been subjects of a
   quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use. In
   this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over
   an annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and
   Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height
   were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals and divided into
   three time blocks for analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and
   14:00-18:00 hr). I employed multivariate tests of independence to
   examine daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use according to sex,
   season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the day, V. rubra is
   frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable departures
   (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and
   lactation. E. f. albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food
   choice and microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes
   are equally variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use
   appear related to thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements,
   seasonal food availability and circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly
   insect) palatability, predator avoidance tactics, and in the case of
   Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food choice in V. rubra
   support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why primates
   consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f
   albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses. (C) 2004

AB We present a predator-prey metaphysiological model, based on the
   available behavioral and physiological information of the sigmodontine
   rodent Phyllotis darwini The model is focused on the population-level
   consequences of the antipredator behavior, performed by the rodent
   population, which is assumed to be an inducible response of predation
   avoidance. The decrease in vulnerability is explicitly considered to
   have two associated costs: a decreasing foraging success and an
   increasing metabolic loss. The model analysis was carried out on a
   reduced form of the system by means of numerical and analytical tools.
   We evaluated the stability properties of equilibrium points in the phase
   plane, and carried out bifurcation analyses of rodent equilibrium
   density under varying conditions of three relevant parameters. The
   bifurcation parameters chosen represent predator avoidance effectiveness
   (A), foraging cost of antipredator behavior (C-1(')), and
   activity-metabolism cost (C'(4)). Our analysis suggests that the
   trade-offs 4 involved in antipredator behavior plays a fundamental role
   in the stability properties of the system. Under conditions of high
   foraging cost, stability decreases as antipredator effectiveness
   increases. Under the complementary scenario (not considering the highest

AB Analysis and simulation of biospheric responses to historical forcing
   require surface climate data that capture those aspects of climate that
   control ecological processes, including key spatial gradients and modes
   of temporal variability, We developed a multivariate, gridded historical
   climate dataset for the conterminous USA as a common input database for
   the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP), a
   biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation model intercomparison. The dataset
   covers the period 1895-1993 on a 0.5degrees latitude/longitude grid.
   Climate is represented at both monthly and daily timesteps. Variables
   are: precipitation, mininimum and maximum temperature, total incident
   solar radiation, daylight-period irradiance, vapor pressure, and
   daylight-period relative humidity. The dataset was derived from US
   Historical Climate Network (HCN), cooperative network, and snowpack
   telemetry (SNOTEL) monthly precipitation and mean minimum and maximum
   temperature station data. We employed techniques that rely on
   geostatistical and physical relationships to create the temporally and
   spatially complete dataset. We developed a local kriging prediction
   model to infill discontinuous and limited-length station records based
   on spatial autocorrelation structure of climate anomalies. A spatial
   interpolation model (PRISM) that accounts for physiographic controls was
   used to grid the infilled monthly station data. We implemented a
   stochastic weather generator (modified WGEN) to disaggregate the gridded
   monthly series to dailies. Radiation and humidity variables were
   estimated from the dailies using a physically-based empirical surface
   climate model (MTCLIM3). Derived datasets include a 100 yr model spin-up
   climate and a historical Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) dataset.
   The VEMAP dataset exhibits statistically significant trends in
   temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapor pressure, and PDSI
   for US National Assessment regions. The historical climate and companion
   datasets are available online at data archive centers.

AB Molecular mechanisms underlying standing genetic variation of an
   ecologically relevant trait such as pigmentation trait variation in a
   model insect, Drosophila melanogaster, are relevant to our understanding
   of different kinds of intergenomic interactions. In this study, we
   focused on the association between body pigmentation and stress
   resistance, and on genotype-by-environment interaction, both of which
   are likely to contribute to the persistence of phenotypic variation in a
   natural population. First, we detected a significant association between
   pigmentation traits in females and starvation resistance (darker strains
   were weaker) and a weak association between pigmentation and chill coma
   recovery time (darker strains showed shorter recovery time) among 20
   inbred strains from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel
   (DGRP), which originated from a natural population in North America.
   These associations revealed a complex relationship between body
   pigmentation and physiological traits that may give rise to balanced
   selective forces acting on the traits under fluctuating environmental
   conditions. Second, using four of the DGRP strains, a substantial degree
   of genotype (strain) x environment (rearing temperature) interaction was
   detected among expression levels of the genes encoding effector enzymes
   in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. These interactions can potentially
   reduce the efficiency of purifying selection on the pigmentation traits
   over a wide range of temperature conditions. Finally, we discuss
   possible mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of the standing
   pigmentation variation in this species.

AB Superimposed on inherently high basal metabolic demands, the additional
   energetic requirements of reproduction can push female sea otters beyond
   physiological limits. Indeed, the resulting energy imbalance contributes
   to disproportionately high rates of mortality at the end of lactation in
   this species. To examine and quantify metabolic changes associated with
   reproduction, we measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of a female
   sea otter across gestation, lactation and non-reproductive periods.
   Concurrently, measurements were made on a non-breeding control female.
   Our results suggest that RMR declines during gestation. Conversely, RMR
   increases during lactation, reaches a peak at 3-4 months postpartum, and
   remains elevated until weaning. Combining these direct measurements with
   published data, we found the cost of pup rearing to be significantly
   higher than previously estimated. High baseline energy demands and
   limited energy reserves, combined with significant lactation and pup
   rearing costs, appear to necessitate metabolic and thermal lability
   during key reproductive stages.

AB The cuttlefish Sepia officinalis is an important fishery resource in the
   English Channel, and one of the largest stocks of cephalopods in the
   Northeast Atlantic. Cuttlefish live for approximately 2 years and
   catches consequently depend largely on recruitment. Early life stages
   were analysed for differences in juvenile growth and age-at-recruitment
   to the commercial fisheries. Recruits were sampled monthly between
   October 2000 and June 2003, and pre-recruits from the coastal waters of
   the UK and France in the summers of 2000 and 2002. Age (days) was
   determined from statoliths. Although most cuttlefish were recruited
   during autumn, there was some recruitment throughout the year.
   Age-at-recruitment varied significantly between season and cohort, but
   was consistently in the range 3-4 months, so although there was some
   hatching throughout the year, most cuttlefish hatched during summer.
   Fitted growth models indicated that the growth rates of pre-recruits
   (7-59 mm mantle length) were significantly higher in 2002 than in 2000.
   Spatial differences in growth rate were apparent in 2000, suggesting
   that pre-recruit growth may depend on local environmental conditions.
   Pre-recruits and recruits combined (7-106 mm mantle length) also showed
   significant variation in growth between hatching months and years.
   Hypotheses explaining the observed patterns of growth and recruitment
   are presented. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the

AB Life history theory predicts that ectotherms living in warm thermal
   environments should mature early because of fast juvenile growth, but it
   is unclear whether such early maturity will occur in the absence of
   conditions that promote fast juvenile growth. To assess this possibility
   and to determine the effect of warm thermal regimes on body size at
   maturity, we compared the growth and life history patterns of three
   populations of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) introduced into warm,
   Mediterranean waterbodies in southern France with native populations
   living in cool thermal regimes in Ontario, Canada. Growth and life
   history traits of the French populations were determined from monthly
   samples collected from May to September. Mean age at maturity in the
   French populations ranged from 1.3-2.3 years, and was significantly
   earlier than that of populations inhabiting Ontario lakes. Length at age
   2, an indicator of the juvenile growth rate, was not significantly
   different between the French and Ontario populations, and the French
   populations matured significantly earlier than Ontario lake populations
   even when juvenile growth was taken into account. Length at maturity in
   the French populations was also significantly smaller. and although
   there was no significant difference between the French and Ontario
   populations in mean GSI, the results of a previous reproductive
   allocation experiment suggest that French populations have a longer
   breeding season, and greater reproductive effort than Ontario
   pumpkinseeds. The earlier maturity of French pumpkinseeds could be a
   direct physiological effect of the warm thermal environment, but factors
   other than thermal regime may be contributing to the difference in life
   history traits between the French and Ontario populations.

AB One approach to identifying and mapping the state of marine biophysical
   conditions is the identification of large-scale ecological units for
   which conditions are similar and the strategies of management may also
   be similar. Because biological processes are difficult to directly
   record over large areas, abiotic characteristics are used as surrogate
   parameters. In this work, the Mediterranean Sea was classified into
   homogeneous spatial areas based on abiotic variables. Eight parameters
   were selected based on salinity, sea surface temperature,
   photosynthetically active radiation, sea-wave heights and depth
   variables. The parameters were gathered in grid points of 0.5 spatial
   resolution in the open sea and 0.125 in coastal areas. The typologies
   were obtained by data mining the eight parameters throughout the
   Mediterranean and combining two clustering techniques: self-organizing
   maps and the k-means algorithm. The result is a division of the
   Mediterranean Sea into seven typologies. For these typologies, the
   classification recognizes differences in temperature, salinity and
   radiation. In addition, it separates coastal from deep areas. The
   influence of river discharges and the entrance of water from other seas
   are also reflected. These results are consistent with the ecological
   requirements of the five studied seagrasses (Posidonia oceanica, Zostera
   marina, Zostera noltei, Cymodocea nodosa, Halophila stipulacea),
   supporting the suitability of the resulting classification and the
   proposed methodology. The approach thus provides a tool for the
   sustainable management of large marine areas and the ability to address
   not only present threats but also future conditions, such as climate
   change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aquaculture of macroalgae for human consumption and other high-end
   applications is experiencing unprecedented development in European
   countries, with the brown algae Saccharina latissima being the flag
   species. However, environmental conditions in open sea culture sites are
   often unique, which may impact the biochemical composition of cultured
   macroalgae. The present study compared the elemental compositions
   (CHNS), fatty acid profiles, and lipidomes of S. latissima originating
   from three distinct locations (France, Norway, and the United Kingdom).
   Significant differences were found in the elemental composition, with
   Norwegian samples displaying twice the lipid content of the others, and
   significantly less protein (2.6%, while French and UK samples contained
   6.3% and 9.1%, respectively). The fatty acid profiles also differed
   considerably, with UK samples displaying a lower content of n-3 fatty
   acids (21.6%), resulting in a higher n-6/n-3 ratio. Regarding the
   lipidomic profile, samples from France were enriched in lyso lipids,
   while those from Norway displayed a particular signature of
   phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine.
   Samples from the UK featured higher levels of phosphatidylethanolamine
   and, in general, a lower content of galactolipids. These differences
   highlight the influence of site-specific environmental conditions in the
   shaping of macroalgae biochemical phenotypes and nutritional value. It
   is also important to highlight that differences recorded in the lipidome
   of S. latissima make it possible to pinpoint specific lipid species that
   are likely to represent origin biomarkers. This finding is relevant for
   future applications in the field of geographic origin traceability and
   food control.

AB Successful management and protection of wild animal populations relies
   on good understanding of their life cycles. Because population dynamics
   depends on intricate interactions of biological and ecological processes
   at various scales, new approaches are needed that account for the
   variability of demographic processes and associated parameters in a
   hierarchy of spatial scales. A hierarchical Bayesian model for the
   resident brown trout (Salmo trutta) life cycle was built to assess the
   relative influence of local and general determinants of mortality. The
   model was fitted to an extensive data set collected in 40 river reaches,
   combining abundance and environmental data (hydraulics, water
   temperature). Density-dependent mortality of juveniles increased at low
   water temperatures and decreased with shelter availability. High water
   temperature increased densitydependent mortality in adults. The model
   could help to predict monthly juvenile and adult mortality under
   scenarios of global warming and changes in shelter availability due to
   habitat degradation or restoration.

AB Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are an ecologically,
   commercially, and culturally important Alaskan groundfish species.
   Commercial harvest of halibut dates back to the late 19th century and
   has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)
   since 1921. IPHC surveys have revealed declining trends in survey
   biomass in multiple regions and region-specific declines in mean
   size-at-age (size-at-age) over the past two decades (>50% in some
   areas). Changes in size-at-age can arise from a variety of physical,
   ecological, sampling, and fishery effects, including size-dependent
   fishery or predation mortality, alteration in growth from variability in
   prey quality or quantity, and changes in temperature-dependent metabolic
   demands. Here, we develop and apply a bioenergetics model for halibut
   using survey-based diet and temperature data for Alaska to evaluate
   potential environmental drivers of size-at-age. In general, juvenile
   (<40 cm fork length) foraging rates were highest in the Gulf of Alaska
   concomitant with higher potential growth and elevated basal metabolic
   demands during warm summer conditions. In contrast, adult (40-120 cm FL)
   potential growth was highest in the Eastern Bering Sea, potentially
   reflecting lower metabolic costs and higher rates of prey consumption in
   that region. We additionally find evidence for interannual variation in
   potential growth, with a higher frequency of reduced growth potential in
   the last decade, particularly in the Eastern Bering Sea in 2015 and 2016
   for both juvenile and adult halibut. These results suggest the potential
   for patterns in size-at-age to arise from trophic and environmental
   constraints that collectively limit growth in some regions and years.

AB The hypothesis that the metabolic rates of birds are convergent and

   Basal metabolic rates (BMR) of 122 species from six families (Corvidae,
   Emberizidae, Fringillidae, Muscicapidae, Nectariniidae, and Parulidae)
   of passerine birds were taken from literature and compared with data on
   their life history traits: food habits, climate, habitat, biotope, type
   of nest and migrations. Using factor analysis and clustering procedures
   different strategies were distinguished according to assortment of
   traits - food strategies: "nectarivorous", "insectivorous",
   "granivorous", "orrinivorous", environmental strategies: "terrestrial",
   "tropical", "boreal" and strategies based on analysis of food and
   remaining traits together: "group 1", "group 2", "group 3". These sets
   are only partly congruent with taxonomic classification. All groups
   demonstrate similar dependence of BMR on body weight but "granivorous"
   have a significantly higher BMR than "nectarivorous" and "tropical" has
   lower BMR than "terrestrial" and "boreal". In contrast, Fringillidae
   have significantly higher BMR than Muscicapidae, Ernberizidae,
   Nectariniidae and Parulidae. Analysis of residuals within ANCOVA for
   strategies and for families indicates that taxonomic affiliation exerts
   greater influence on BMR values than adaptive strategy.

AB The scaling of body parts is central to the expression of morphology
   across body sizes and to the generation of morphological diversity
   within and among species. Although patterns of scaling-relationship
   evolution have been well documented for over one hundred years, little
   is known regarding how selection acts to generate these patterns. In
   part, this is because it is unclear the extent to which the elements of
   log-linear scaling relationshipsthe intercept or mean trait size and the
   slopecan evolve independently. Here, using the wing-body size scaling
   relationship in Drosophila melanogaster as an empirical model, we use
   artificial selection to demonstrate that the slope of a morphological
   scaling relationship between an organ (the wing) and body size can
   evolve independently of mean organ or body size. We discuss our findings
   in the context of how selection likely operates on morphological scaling
   relationships in nature, the developmental basis for evolved changes in
   scaling, and the general approach of using individual-based selection
   experiments to study the expression and evolution of morphological
   scaling.

AB High relative air humidity (RH >= 85%) is frequent in controlled
   environments, and not uncommon in nature. In this review, we examine the
   high RH effects on plants with a special focus on stomatal characters.
   All aspects of stomatal physiology are attenuated by elevated RH during
   leaf expansion (long-term) in C-3 species. These include impaired
   opening and closing response, as well as weak diel oscillations.
   Consequently, the high RH-grown plants are not only vulnerable to biotic
   and abiotic stress, but also undergo a deregulation between CO2 uptake
   and water loss. Stomatal behavior of a single leaf is determined by the
   local microclimate during expansion, and may be different than the
   remaining leaves of the same plant. No effect of high RH is apparent in
   C-4 and CAM species, while the same is expected for species with
   hydropassive stomatal closure. Formation of bigger stomata with larger
   pores is a universal response to high RH during leaf expansion, whereas
   the effect on stomatal density appears to be species- and leaf
   side-specific. Compelling evidence suggests that ABA mediates the high
   RH-induced stomatal malfunction, as well as the stomatal size increase.
   Although high RH stimulates leaf ethylene evolution, it remains elusive
   whether or not this contributes to stomatal malfunction. Most species
   lose stomatal function following mid-term (4-7 d) exposure to high RH
   following leaf expansion. Consequently, the regulatory role of ambient
   humidity on stomatal functionality is not limited to the period of leaf
   expansion, but holds throughout the leaf life span.

AB Temperature appears to be the best predictor of species composition of
   planktonic foraminifera communities, making it possible to use their
   fossil assemblages to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST)
   variation in the past. However, the role of other environmental factors
   potentially modulating the spatial and vertical distribution of
   planktonic foraminifera species is poorly understood. This is especially
   relevant for environmental factors affecting the subsurface habitat. If
   such factors play a role, changes in the abundance of
   subsurface-dwelling species may not solely reflect SST variation. In
   order to constrain the effect of subsurface parameters on species
   composition, we here characterize the vertical distribution of living
   planktonic foraminifera community across an east-west transect through
   the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean, where SST variability was small,
   but the subsurface water mass structure changed dramatically. Four
   planktonic foraminifera communities could be identified across the top
   700 m of the transect. Gyre and Agulhas Leakage surface faunas were
   predominantly composed of Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides
   tenellus, Trilobatus sacculifer, Globoturborotalita rubescens,
   Globigerinella calida, Tenuitella iota, and Globigerinita glutinata, and
   these only differed in terms of relative abundances (community
   composition). Upwelling fauna was dominated by Neogloboquadrina
   pachyderma, Neogloboquadrina incompta, Globorotalia crassaformis, and
   Globorotalia inflata. Thermocline fauna was dominated by Tenuitella
   fleisheri, Globorotalia truncatulinoides, and Globorotalia scitula in
   the west and by G. scitula only in the east. The largest part of the
   standing stock was consistently found in the surface layer, but SST was
   not the main predictor of species composition either for the
   depth-integrated fauna across the stations or at individual depth
   layers. Instead, we identified a pattern of vertical stacking of
   different parameters controlling species composition, reflecting
   different aspects of the pelagic habitat. Whereas productivity appears
   to dominate in the mixed layer (0-60 m), physical properties
   (temperature, salinity) become important at intermediate depths and in
   the subsurface, a complex combination of factors including oxygen
   concentration is required to explain the assemblage composition. These
   results indicate that the seemingly straightforward relationship between
   assemblage composition and SST in sedimentary assemblages reflects
   vertically and seasonally integrated processes that are only indirectly
   linked to SST. It also implies that fossil assemblages of planktonic
   foraminifera should also contain a signature of subsurface processes,
   which could be used for paleoceanographic reconstructions.

AB This review contrasts the frost resistance of plants from the Southern
   Hemisphere with that of the Northern Hemisphere and is principally
   concerned with plants from New Zealand, Australia, and South America. It
   gives a brief overview of methods for determining frost resistance in
   the field and in controlled environments with intact or excised plant
   parts. It considers various methods of determining frost resistance and
   the expression of critical temperatures causing damage, and discusses
   the problems of using excised plant parts and freezing of tissues. This
   review, however, is not principally concerned with physiological aspects
   of frost resistance, but more with biogeographic aspects of the
   environment and quantification of the relationships between frost
   resistance and temperature related factors such as altitude and
   latitude. It gives examples of differences in frost resistance between
   the two hemispheres and attributes these to the contrast between the
   climates of largely continental land masses in the Northern Hemisphere
   and the oceanic environment of the Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, it
   also shows similarities between the frost resistance of plants from the
   Southern Hemisphere during the growing season and the maximum frost
   resistance of tropical alpine species and further similarities between
   species on oceanic islands in both hemispheres. Comprehensive lists of
   species' frost resistance are included in tables and appendices.

AB Organisms in natural habitats must frequently respond to changes in
   their environments through various physiological mechanisms. My
   laboratory has developed several methods for the quantification of
   stress in crustaceans. An ELISA was developed for the crustacean
   hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the American lobster (Homarus
   americanus). It is sensitive to as little as 0.2 fmol of peptide.
   Increases in hemolymph CHH were observed under conditions of acute
   hypoxia, elevated temperature, and altered salinity. In addition,
   elevated CHH concentrations were observed in Norway lobsters (Nephrops
   norvegicus) that were parasitized with the dinoflagellate Hematodinium
   sp.
   Stress proteins, also known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), comprise a
   highly conserved class of proteins that display elevated transcription
   during periods of stress. Using homologous molecular probes, my
   collaborators and I have examined the influence of heat-shock, osmotic
   stress, and the molt cycle upon HSP expression at the protein and mRNA
   levels. We observed a significant elevation in HSP mRNA expression after
   1 hr of heat-shock or after 0.5 hr of osmotic stress. When comparing
   claw and abdominal muscles during molting, we observed a tissue-specific
   HSP response. Quantification of these different stress responses may
   serve as early indicators of the degradation of environmental health.

AB 1. We observed native populations of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) around
   Beijing, China, over 2 years and performed choice and no-choice mating
   tests between melanic and succinic (non-melanic) beetles in the
   laboratory.
   2. Succinic phenotypes outnumbered melanics by 5:1 in autumn, but
   melanics became equally abundant in spring, supporting previous
   inferences that melanism is advantageous in winter, but costly in
   summer.
   3. Female H. axyridis expressed mate preference overtly, by rejecting
   less-preferred phenotypes, and cryptically, by retaining their eggs for
   longer periods after matings with less-preferred males, ostensibly to
   replace their sperm.
   4. Succinic pairs formed more quickly in the spring generation, and
   melanic pairs in the autumn, and the time to copula was affected by both
   male and female phenotype. The strength of mate preference was
   contingent on female phenotype, suggesting melanic alleles had
   pleiotropic effects.
   5. Whereas pair formation was under female control, the duration of
   copula was under male control and lasted longer in the autumn generation
   than in the spring. Copulations in the choice test tended to be shorter
   between similar phenotypes, suggesting that males invested more in
   dissimilar females when alternative mates were available.
   6. Although spring and autumn generations were raised under identical
   conditions, significant contrasts were observed in their reproductive
   behaviour.
   7. Two alternative hypotheses are advanced to explain why
   gender-specific reproductive behaviours might vary between generations:
   maternally-mediated epigenetic factors that influence the expression of
   genes in progeny as a function of maternal environment, and linkage
   disequilibria among alleles that cycle in frequency seasonally as a
   function of assortative mating.

AB The bending stiffness of a phospholipid bilayer (k(c)) was measured by
   forming thin bilayer cylinders (tethers) from giant phospholipid
   vesicles. Based on the balance of forces, the tether force was expected
   to be proportional to the square root of the membrane tension, with a
   constant of proportionality containing k(c). The membrane tension was
   controlled via the aspiration pressure in a micropipette used to hold
   the vesicle. The force on the tether was generated by an electromagnet
   acting on a paramagnetic bead attached to the vesicle surface. The
   magnitude of the force was determined from measurements of the magnet
   current, which was adjusted to maintain the position of the bead,
   Measurements were performed on vesicles composed of
   stearoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine plus 5% (by mole) biotinylated
   phosphatidylethanolamine to mediate adhesion to streptavidin-coated
   beads. From each vesicle, tethers were formed repeatedly at different
   values of the membrane tension. The expected relationship between
   membrane tension and tether force was observed. The mean value of k(c)
   for 10 different vesicles was 1.17 x 10(-19) J (SD = 0.08 x 10(-19) J).
   The precision of these data demonstrates the reliability of this
   approach, which avoids uncertainties of interpretation and measurement
   that may be associated with other methods for determining k(c).

AB Many cells crawl by extending an actin-rich pseudopod. We have devised a
   simulation that describes how the polymerization kinetics of a branched
   actin filament network, coupled with excluded volume effects, powers the
   motility of crawling cells such as amoebae and fish keratocytes. Our
   stochastic simulation is based on the key fundamental properties of
   actin polymerization, namely growth, shrinkage, capping, branching, and
   nucleation, and also includes contributions from the creation and
   breaking of adhesive contacts with the substrate together with excluded
   volume effects related to filament packing. When reasonable values for
   appropriate constants were employed, this simulation generated a
   force-velocity relationship that resembled closely that observed
   experimentally. Our simulations indicated that excluded volume effects
   associated with actin filament branching lead to a decreased packing
   efficiency and resultant swelling of the cytoskeleton gel that
   contributes substantially to lamellipod protrusion.

AB According to a hypothesis presented in the mid-1980s, climate warming
   will, paradoxically, increase the risk of frost damage to trees in the
   boreal and temperate zones. Dehardening and even growth onset may occur
   in trees during mild spells in winter and early spring, resulting in
   damage during subsequent periods of frost. In the present study,
   ecophysiological traits critical to the occurrence of frost damage in
   trees in the boreal zone were identified. Diagnostic computer
   simulations were performed to examine why one simulation model of frost
   hardiness in an earlier study predicted heavy frost damage as a
   consequence of climate warming, whereas another closely related model
   did not. The modeling comparison revealed that the response of
   ontogenetic development to air temperature during quiescence is a
   critical factor determining the risk of frost damage. As the response
   can be readily determined in growth-chamber experiments, the findings of
   the present study can be used to guide experimental work on the
   environmental regulation of the annual cycle of frost hardiness in

AB Drought-tolerant rice variety, Nagina 22 (N22), has a unique spikelet
   miRNome during anthesis stage drought as well as transition from heading
   to anthesis.
   Molecular characterization of genetic diversity of rice is essential to
   understand the evolution and molecular basis of various agronomically
   important traits such as drought tolerance. miRNAs play an important
   role in regulating plant development as well as stress response such as
   drought. In this study, we characterized the yet unexplored dynamics of
   the spikelet miRNA population during developmental transition from
   'heading' to 'anthesis' as well as anthesis stage drought stress in a
   drought-tolerant indica rice variety, N22. A significant proportion of
   miRNA population (20 %) in N22 spikelets is modulated during transition
   from heading to anthesis indicating a unique miRNome at anthesis, a
   developmental stage highly sensitive to stress (drought/heat). Based on
   the analysis of degradome data, majority of differentially regulated
   miRNAs appear to regulate transcription factors, some of which are
   implicated in regulation of development and fertilization. Similarly,
   drought during anthesis leads to a global change in miRNA expression
   pattern including those which regulate ROS homeostasis. It was possible
   to identify several miRNAs that were not reported to be drought
   responsive in earlier studies. Interestingly, a significant proportion
   of the drought-regulated miRNAs co-localize within QTLs related to
   drought tolerance and associated traits. Comparison of the expression
   profiles between N22 and Pusa Basmati 1 (drought sensitive) identified
   miRNAs with variety-specific expression patterns during phase transition
   (miR164, miR396, miR812, and miR1881) as well as drought stress
   (miR1881) indicating an evolution of a distinct and variety-specific
   regulatory mechanism. The promoters of these miRNAs contain LREs
   (light-responsive elements) and are induced by dark treatment. It was
   also possible to identify 4 novel miRNAs including an intronic miRNA
   that was conserved in both rice varieties.

AB Cold tolerance is considered an important factor determining the
   geographic distribution of insects. We have previously shown that
   despite its tropical origin, the cockroach Gromphadorinha coquereliana
   is capable of surviving exposures to cold. However, the freezing
   tolerance of this species had not yet been examined. Low temperature is
   known to alter membrane integrity in insects, but whether chilling or
   freezing compromises DNA integrity remains a matter of speculation. In
   the present study, we subjected the G. coquereliana adults to freezing
   to determine their supercooling point (SCP) and evaluated whether the
   cockroaches were capable of surviving partial and complete freezing.
   Next, we conducted single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays to
   determine whether heat, cold and freezing altered hemocyte DNA
   integrity. The SCP of this species was high and around -4.76 degrees C,
   which is within the typical range of freezing-tolerant species. Most
   cockroaches survived to 1 day after partial ice formation (20%
   mortality), but died progressively in the next few days after cold
   stress (70% mortality after 4 days). One day after complete freezing,
   most insects died (70% mortality), and after 4 days, 90% of them had
   succumbed. The SCGE assays showed substantial levels of DNA damage in
   hemocytes. When cockroaches were heat-stressed, the level of DNA damage
   was similar to that observed in the freezing treatment, though all
   heat-stressed insects survived. The present study shows that G.
   coquereliana can be considered as moderately freeze-tolerant, and that
   extreme low temperature stress can affect DNA integrity, suggesting that
   this cockroach may possess an efficient DNA repair system.

AB Diatoms account for about 40% of primary production in highly productive
   ecosystems. The development of a new generation of fluorometers has made
   it possible to improve estimation of the electron transport rate from
   photosystem II, which, when coupled with the carbon incorporation rate
   enables estimation of the electrons required for carbon fixation. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the daily dynamics of these
   electron requirements as a function of the diel light cycle in three
   relevant diatom species and to apprehend if the method of estimating the
   electron transport rate can lead to different pictures of the dynamics.
   The results confirmed the species-dependent capacity for
   photoacclimation under increasing light levels. Despite daily variations
   in the photosynthetic parameters, the results of this study underline
   the low daily variability of the electron requirements estimated using
   functional absorption of the photosystem II compared to an estimation
   based on a specific absorption cross section of chlorophyll a. The
   stability of the electron requirements throughout the day would suggest
   it is potentially possible to estimate high-frequency primary production
   by using autonomous variable fluorescence measurements from
   ships-of-opportunity or moorings, without taking potential daily
   variation in this parameter into consideration, but this result has to
   be confirmed on natural phytoplankton assemblages. The results obtained
   in this study confirm the low electron requirements of diatoms to
   perform photosynthesis, and suggest a potential additional source of
   energy for carbon fixation, as recently described in the literature for
   this class.

AB Background: The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is an important regulator of
   cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Many of its structural features are highly
   conserved across a wide range of species. Invertebrates have a single
   NCX gene, whereas vertebrate species have multiple NCX genes as a result
   of at least two duplication events. To examine the molecular evolution
   of NCX genes and understand the role of duplicated genes in the
   evolution of the vertebrate NCX gene family, we carried out phylogenetic
   analyses of NCX genes and compared NCX gene structures from sequenced
   genomes and individual clones.
   Results: A single NCX in invertebrates and the protochordate Ciona, and
   the presence of at least four NCX genes in the genomes of teleosts, an
   amphibian, and a reptile suggest that a four member gene family arose in
   a basal vertebrate. Extensive examination of mammalian and avian genomes
   and synteny analysis argue that NCX4 may be lost in these lineages.
   Duplicates for NCX1, NCX2, and NCX4 were found in all sequenced teleost
   genomes. The presence of seven genes encoding NCX homologs may provide
   teleosts with the functional specialization analogous to the alternate
   splicing strategy seen with the three NCX mammalian homologs.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NCX4 is present in teleost,
   amphibian and reptilian species but has been secondarily and
   independently lost in mammals and birds. Comparative studies on
   conserved vertebrate homologs have provided a possible evolutionary
   route taken by gene duplicates subfunctionalization by minimizing
   homolog number.

AB Sediment bacterial community and their relation with environmental
   factors were investigated in the five different trophic status lake
   regions sediment, Meiliang Bay, Wuli Lake, Gonghu Bay, Western Lake
   Taihu and Xukou Bay in a large, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake (Lake
   Taihu, China). Water and surface sediment samples were collected at 35
   sampling sites in January 2014 (winter) and July 2015 (summer). The
   physicochemical characterization showed that there were obvious changes
   in the trophic status and eutrophic index of five lake regions, which
   was mainly due to the difference of organic matter source. Based on the
   analysis of aquatic environmental characteristics, the organic nitrogen
   or nitrate nitrogen was the main storing form in the overlying water of
   five lake regions. In addition, nitrate nitrogen in pore water was lower
   than in overlying water, while ammonia nitrogen in pore water was higher
   than in overlying water. According to the DGGE profiles, temporal and
   spatial variations of bacterial community were apparent. Bacterial
   diversity was higher in summer than in winter and increased with the
   decrease in the lake region trophic status. The dendrogram of the
   bacterial community similarities revealed that samples were almost all
   grouped into two defined clusters (summer and winter), which indicated
   that season rather than region was the dominant factor. Canonical
   correspondence analysis demonstrated that ammonia nitrogen and
   nitrate-nitrite nitrogen in the sediment and pore water, organic matter
   and temperature significantly influenced the sediment bacterial
   community in the five lake regions.

AB Selection of an appropriate model for respiration (R) is important for
   accurate gap-filling of CO2 flux data, and for partitioning measurements
   of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to respiration and gross ecosystem
   exchange (GEE). Using cross-validation methods and a version of Akaike's
   Information Criterion (AIC), we evaluate a wide range of simple
   respiration models with the objective of quantifying the implications of
   selecting a particular model. We fit the models to eddy covariance
   measurements of whole-ecosystem respiration (R-eco) from three different
   ecosystem types (a coniferous forest, a deciduous forest, and a
   grassland), as well as soil respiration data from one of these sites.
   The well-known Q(10) model, whether driven by air or soil temperature,
   performed poorly compared to other models, as did the Lloyd and Taylor
   model when used with two of the parameters constrained to previously
   published values and only the scale parameter being fit. The continued
   use of these models is discouraged. However, a variant of the Q(10)
   model, in which the temperature sensitivity of respiration varied
   seasonally, performed reasonably well, as did the unconstrained
   three-parameter Lloyd and Taylor model. Highly parameterized neural
   network models, using additional covariates, generally provided the best
   fits to the data, but appeared not to perform well when making
   predictions outside the domain used for parameterization, and should
   thus be avoided when large gaps must be filled. For each data set, the
   annual sum of modeled respiration (annual Sigma R) was positively
   correlated with model goodness-of-fit, implying that poor model
   selection may inject a systematic bias into gap-filled estimates of
   annual Sigma R. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   21st century (2081-2100) over Southeast Asia (SEA) using the output of
   the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling/Coordinated Regional
   Climate Downscaling Experiment - Southeast Asia (SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA).
   Eight ensemble members, representing a subset of archived CORDEX-SEA
   simulations at 25 km spatial resolution, were examined for emission
   scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The study utilised four different
   indicators of rainfall extreme, i.e. the annual/seasonal rainfall total
   (PRCPTOT), consecutive dry days (CDD), frequency of extremely heavy
   rainfall (R50mm) and annual/seasonal maximum of daily rainfall (RX1day).
   In general, changes in extreme indices are more pronounced and covering
   wider area under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. The decrease in annual PRCPTOT is
   projected over most of SEA region, except for Myanmar and Northern
   Thailand, with magnitude as much as 20% (30%) under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5)
   scenario. The most significant and robust changes were noted in CDD,
   which is projected to increase by as much as 30% under RCP4.5 and 60%
   under RCP8.5, particularly over Maritime Continent (MC). The projected
   decrease in PRCPTOT over MC is significant and robust during June to
   August (JJA) and September to November (SON). During March to May (MAM)
   under RCP8.5, significant and robust PRCPTOT decreases are also
   projected over Indochina. The CDD changes during JJA and SON over MC are
   even higher, more robust and significant compared to the annual changes.
   At the same time, a wetting tendency is also projected over Indochina.
   The R50mm and RX1day are projected to increase, during all seasons with
   significant and robust signal of RX1day during JJA and SON.

AB With ocean warming predicted globally, one of the mechanisms driving
   distributional shifts and changes in the abundance of resident fishes is
   reproductive output. The relationship between sea surface temperature
   and the reproductive activity of a eurythermic, resident coastal
   species, blacktail seabream Diplodus sargus capensis, was examined in
   the "ocean warming" hotspot of the northern Benguela. Reproductive
   activity was found to be restricted to periods when the water
   temperature dropped below 20 A degrees C. A metadata analysis conducted
   on the D. sargus sub-species complex similarly showed that reproductive
   activity was restricted to temperatures between 15 and 20 A degrees C,
   regardless of the range in ambient water temperature. Based on these
   findings and using satellite derived SST information, we examined D. s.
   capensis's total and seasonal "reproductive scope" that is defined as
   either the area suitable for spawning each year or the duration of its
   potential spawning season at a fixed geographical locality,
   respectively. Trends were examined over the last three decades.
   Reproductive scope by area was found to be shrinking at a rate of 7 %
   per decade in southern Angola and expanding at a rate of 6 % per decade
   in northern Namibia. Reproductive scope by season decreased by 1.05
   months per decade in Namibe, southern Angola and increased by 0.76
   months per decade in Hentiesbaai, northern Namibia. Changes in
   reproductive scope may be a driving mechanism of distributional shifts
   in resident fishes, although the rate of the shifts is likely to be
   slow. More importantly, changes in reproductive scope will not be
   uniform throughout fish distributions and will most likely result in
   heterogeneous variations in fish abundance.

AB The Metabolic Theory of Ecology has renewed interest in using energetics
   to scale across levels of ecological organization. Can scaling from
   individual phenotypes to population dynamics provides insight into why
   species have shifted their phenologies, abundances and distributions
   idiosyncratically in response to recent climate change? We consider how
   the energetic implications of phenotypes may scale to understand
   population and species level responses to climate change using four
   focal grasshopper species along an elevation gradient in Colorado. We
   use a biophysical model to translate phenotypes and environmental
   conditions into estimates of body temperatures. We measure thermal
   tolerances and preferences and metabolic rates to assess rates of energy
   use and acquisition. Body mass declines along the elevation gradient for
   all species, but mass-specific metabolic rates increases only modestly.
   We find interspecific differences in both overall thermal tolerances and
   preferences and in the variation of these metrics along the elevation
   gradient. The more dispersive species exhibit significantly higher
   thermal tolerance and preference consistent with much of their range
   spanning hot, low elevation areas. When integrating these metrics to
   consider metabolic constraints, we find that energetic costs decrease
   along the elevation gradient due to decreasing body size and
   temperature. Opportunities for energy acquisition, as reflected by the
   proportion of time that falls within a grasshopper's thermal tolerance
   range, peak at mid elevations. We discuss methods for translating these
   energetic metrics into population dynamics. Quantifying energy balances
   and allocation offers a viable approach for predicting how populations
   will respond to climate change and the consequences for species composed
   of populations that may be locally adapted.

AB In this report, we explore the matching of structures to functional

   consumption and the development of the lung in the leaf-eared mouse
   Phyllotis darwini in warm and cold environments. We discuss whether the
   state of structural design is commensurate with functional needs from
   regulated morphogenesis as predicted by the hypothesis of symmorphosis.
   We found a close match between respiratory structures and functional
   needs during postnatal development, expressed as safety factors close to
   unity. However, in the adult stage the safety factors were greater than
   two, which suggests that adult animals acquired a structure greater than
   that required considering their maximum capacities. A high safety factor
   in the respiratory system of adult mice may be a consequence of the
   symmorphosis that operates during ontogeny and does not necessarily
   support a rejection of this hypothesis.

AB Allen's rule predicts that homeotherms inhabiting cooler climates will
   have smaller appendages, while those inhabiting warmer climates will
   have larger appendages relative to body size. Birds' bills tend to be
   larger at lower latitudes, but few studies have tested whether modern
   climate change and urbanization affect bill size. Our study explored
   whether bill size in a wide-ranging bird would be larger in warmer,
   drier regions and increase with rising temperatures. Furthermore, we
   predicted that bill size would be larger in densely populated areas, due
   to urban heat island effects and the higher concentration of
   supplementary foods. Using measurements from 605 museum specimens, we
   explored the effects of climate and housing density on northern cardinal
   bill size over an 85-year period across the Linnaean subspecies' range.
   We quantified the geographic relationships between bill surface area,
   housing density, and minimum temperature using linear mixed effect
   models and geographically weighted regression. We then tested whether
   bill surface area changed due to housing density and temperature in
   three subregions (Chicago, IL., Washington, D.C., and Ithaca, NY).
   Across North America, cardinals occupying drier regions had larger
   bills, a pattern strongest in males. This relationship was mediated by
   temperature such that birds in warm, dry areas had larger bills than
   those in cool, dry areas. Over time, female cardinals' bill size
   increased with warming temperatures in Washington, D.C., and Ithaca.
   Bill size was smaller in developed areas of Chicago, but larger in
   Washington, D.C., while there was no pattern in Ithaca, NY. We found
   that climate and urbanization were strongly associated with bill size
   for a wide-ranging bird. These biogeographic relationships were
   characterized by sex-specific differences, varying relationships with
   housing density, and geographic variability. It is likely that
   anthropogenic pressures will continue to influence species, potentially
   promoting microevolutionary changes over space and time.

AB 1. We report patterns of temporal Variation in the recruitment of roach
   (Rutilus rutilus). The data consist of the annual abundance of the first
   2 year-classes, 0 + and 1+ fish, at four sites in the Rhone River
   (France) between 1987 and 1997. Over this 11-year period both Of and It
   fish fluctuated strongly.
   2. Cross-correlation indicated high spatial synchrony in 0+ dynamics,
   although correlations among sites in 1+ dynamics were weaker. No clear
   pattern was apparent in the relationship between the level of synchrony
   and distance between pairs of sites.
   3. The spatial synchrony in 0 + fish could be attributable to
   large-scale variations in weather, influencing water temperature. Total
   body length of 0 + roach was correlated with water temperature
   (expressed in degree-days over 12 degreesC), and water temperature was
   the main factor explaining inter-annual variation in 0+ cohort size.
   Monthly variation in abiotic factors (measured by standard deviation in
   water temperature and discharge) did not influence 0+ fluctuations.
   Correlations with June water temperature suggest that year-class
   strength was mainly determined by abiotic factors during the first few
   months of life.
   4. The absence of spatial synchrony in 1+ fluctuations suggests little
   correlation between survival and abiotic conditions during the first
   year of life, other factors influencing survival.
   5. Survival in the first year was density-dependent. Intraspecific
   competition within the 0+ cohort could thus influence the fluctuations
   in recruitment to older age-classes.
   6. The implications of age- or stage-dependent synchrony in temporal
   variation for species with complex life histories are discussed.
   Studying spatial synchrony for the different life history stages could
   enhance our understanding of the population dynamics of spatially
   structured species.

AB Motile cells explore their surrounding milieu by extending thin dynamic
   protrusions, or filopodia. The growth of. lopodia is driven by actin
   filament bundles that polymerize underneath the cell membrane. We
   compute the mechanical and dynamical features of the protrusion growth
   process by explicitly incorporating the flexible plasma membrane. We
   find that a critical number of filaments are needed to generate net.
   lopodial growth. Without external in. fluences, the. lopodium can extend
   inde. nitely up to the buckling length of the F-actin bundle. Dynamical
   calculations show that the protrusion speed is enhanced by the thermal.
   uctuations of the membrane; a filament bundle encased in a flexible
   membrane grows much faster. The protrusion speed depends directly on the
   number and spatial arrangement of the filaments in the bundle and
   whether the. laments are tethered to the membrane. Filopodia also
   attract each other through distortions of the membrane. Spatially close
   filopodia will merge to form a larger one. Force-velocity relationships
   mimicking micromanipulation experiments testing our predictions are

   exacerbate or mitigate responses to climate change. Likewise, land use
   change or agricultural practices can affect responses to climate change.
   Nonetheless, our knowledge of effects of climate change is still biased
   by organism and geographic region, and to some extent by scale of
   climate parameter.

AB A half-sib analysis was used to investigate genetic variation for three
   morphological traits (thorax length, wing length and sternopleural
   bristle number) and two life-history traits (developmental time and
   larva-to-adult viability) in Drosophila melanogaster reared at a
   standard (25degreesC) and a low stressful (13degreesC) temperature. Both
   phenotypic and environmental variation showed a significant increase
   under stressful conditions in all traits. For estimates of genetic
   variation, no statistically significant differences were found between
   the two environments. Narrow heritabilities tended to be higher at
   13degreesC for sternopleural bristle number and viability and at
   25degreesC for wing length and developmental time, whereas thorax length
   did not show any trend. However, the pattern of genetic variances and
   evolvability indices (coefficient of genetic variation and
   evolvability), considered in the context of literature evidence,
   indicated the possibility of an increase in additive genetic variation
   for the morphological traits and viability and in nonadditive genetic
   variation for developmental time. The data suggest that the effect of
   stressful temperature may be trait-specific and this warns against
   generalizations about the behaviour of genetic variation under extreme
   conditions.

AB The effect of cold hardening on the accumulation of glutathione (GSH)
   and its precursors was studied in the shoots and roots of wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Cheyenne (Ch, frost-tolerant) and cv. Chinese
   Spring (CS, moderately frost-sensitive),in a T. spelta L. accession
   (Tsp, frost-sensitive) and in chromosome substitution lines CS (Ch 5A)
   and CS (Tsp 5A). The fast induction of total glutathione accumulation
   was detected during the first 3 d of hardening in the shoots, especially
   in the frost-tolerant Ch and CS (Ch 5A). This observation was
   corroborated by the study of de novo GSH synthesis using [S-35]sulfate.
   In Ch and CS (Ch 5A) the total cysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine
   (precursors of GSH), hydroxymethylglutathione and GSH contents were
   greater during the 51-d treatment than in the sensitive genotypes. After
   35 d hardening, when the maximum frost tolerance was observed, greater
   ratios of reduced to oxidised hydroxymethylglutathione and glutathione
   were detected in Ch and CS (Ch 5A) compared to the sensitive genotypes.
   A correspondingly greater glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) activity
   was also found in Ch and CS (Ch 5A). It can be assumed that chromosome
   5A of wheat has an influence on GSH accumulation and on the ratio of
   reduced to oxidised glutathione as part of a complex regulatory function
   during hardening. Consequently, GSH may contribute to the enhancement of
   frost tolerance in wheat.

AB On the Yucatan Peninsula there is an upwelling which allows access to a
   body of cold water that controls temperature in this area. This
   modulates the ecology and distribution of organisms that inhabit the
   continental shelf. The objective of this study was to determine the
   effect of different acclimation temperatures on the thermal biology of
   prey as mollusc, crustacean (Melongena corona bispinosa, Strombus
   pugilis, Callinectes similis, Libinia dubia) and predators as fish
   (Ocyurus chlysurus, Centropomus undecimalis) of Octopus maya. Octopus
   prey preferred temperatures between 23.5 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C,
   while predators preferred temperatures 26.4-28.5 degrees C. The species
   with largest thermal windows were M. corona bispinosa (328.8 degrees
   C-2), C simi/is (322.8 degrees C-2), L. dubia (319.2 degrees C-2), C.
   undecimalis (288.6 degrees C-2), 0. chrysurus (237.5 degrees C-2), while
   the smallest thermal window was for S. pugilis (202.0 degrees C-2). The
   acclimation response ratios (ARR)-estimated for prey ranged from
   0.24-0.55 in animals exposed to CTMax and 0.21-0.65 in those exposed to
   CTMin. Amongst predators, ARR ranged from 0.30 to 0.60 and 0.41 to 0.53
   for animals exposed to CTMax and CTMin, respectively. Correlating the
   optimal temperature limits of prey and predators with surface
   temperatures on the continental shelf and those 4 m deep showed that the
   main prey, Callinectes similis and L dubia, shared a thermal niche and
   that an increase in temperature could force these species to migrate to
   other sites to find optimal temperatures for their physiological
   functions. As a consequence the continental shelf community would
   undergo a structural change. Predators were found to be near their
   optimal temperatures in surface temperatures on the continental shelf.
   We conclude that they would remain in the area in a warming scenario.
   The size of the thermal window was related to the type of ecosystem
   inhabited by these species. These ARR intervals allowed us to categorize
   the species as temperate or tropical, according to the oceanographic
   conditions that prevail on the Yucatan Peninsula. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding whether populations and communities can evolve fast enough
   to keep up with ongoing climate change is one of the most pressing
   issues in biology today. A growing number of studies have documented
   rapid evolutionary responses to warming, suggesting that populations may
   be able to persist despite temperature increases. The challenge now is
   to better understand how species interactions, which are ubiquitous in
   nature, mediate these population responses to warming. Here, we use
   laboratory natural selection experiments in a freshwater community to
   test hypotheses related to how thermal evolution of Daphnia pulex to two
   selection temperatures (12 and 18 degrees C) is mediated by rapid
   thermal evolution of its algal resource (Scenedesmus obliquus) or by the
   presence of the zooplankton predator Chaoborus americanus. We found that
   cold-evolved algae (a high-quality resource) facilitated the evolution
   of increased thermal plasticity in Daphnia populations selected at 12
   degrees C, for both body size and per capita growth rates (r).
   Conversely, warm-evolved algae facilitated the evolution of increased r
   thermal plasticity for Daphnia selected at 18 degrees C. Lastly, we
   found that the effect of selection temperature on evolved Daphnia body
   size was more pronounced when Daphnia were also reared with predators.
   These data demonstrate that trait evolution of a focal population to the
   thermal environment can be affected by both bottom-up and top-down
   species interactions and that rapid temperature evolution of a resource
   can have cascading effects on consumer thermal evolution. Our study
   highlights the importance of incorporating species interactions when
   estimating ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and
   communities to ongoing temperature warming.

AB A simple technique based on seasonal changes in gonad weights was used
   to describe key events in the spawning and maturation cycle of
   spring-spawning herring in the north-west Atlantic. Analysis showed that
   there were quite large inter-annual variations in the timing and
   duration of the maturation and spawning periods. The initial maturation
   process, which begins in the fall, is controlled mainly by phenotypic
   factors related to the size composition and condition of the adult
   population. The final maturation process, which begins in the spring and
   whose trajectory determines spawning times, is cued by January sea
   temperatures. The results contradict the general opinion that herring
   have a relatively fixed spawning season that is restricted to a brief
   4-6 week period. Rather, the plasticity in spawning and maturation
   cycles of spring-spawning herring suggests that herring recruitment may
   not be a passive affair but an adaptive process in which Atlantic
   herring modify their reproductive activities to match expected
   environmental conditions during larval emergence. (C) 1996 International

AB Intracellular propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes is the best
   understood form of motility dependent on actin polymerization. We have
   used in vitro motility assays of Listeria in platelet and brain extracts
   to elucidate the function of the focal adhesion proteins of the Ena
   (Drosophila Enabled)/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family
   in actin-based motility. Immunodepletion of VASP from platelet extracts
   and of Evl (Ena/VASP-like protein) from brain extracts of Mena knockout
   (-/-) mice combined with add-back of recombinant (bacterial or
   eukaryotic) VASP and Evl show that VASP, Mena, and Evl play
   interchangeable roles and are required to transform actin polymerization
   into active movement and propulsive force. The EVH1 (Ena/VASP homology
   1) domain of VASP is in slow association-dissociation equilibrium
   high-affinity binding to the zyxin-homologous, proline-rich region of
   ActA. VASP also interacts with F-actin via its COOH-terminal EVH2
   domain. Hence VASP/Ena/Evl link the bacterium to the actin tail, which
   is required for movement. The affinity of VASP for F-actin is controlled
   by phosphorylation of serine 157 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
   Phospho-VASP binds with high affinity (0.5 x 10(8) M-1); dephospho-VASP
   binds 40-fold less tightly. We propose a molecular ratchet model for
   insertional polymerization of actin, within which frequent
   attachment-detachment of VASP to F-actin allows its sliding along the
   growing filament.

AB AimRecognition that statistical models do not always reliably predict
   habitat suitability under future climate scenarios is leading
   increasingly to explicit incorporation of the physiological constraints
   that underlie species' distributions into spatially explicit
   predictions. However, computational intensity constrains the use of
   high-resolution, process-explicit models. We examined whether
   geostatistical analysis can effectively interpolate a biophysical model,
   reducing the computational investment typically required for using
   mechanistic methods to inform physiological predictions.
   LocationNew Zealand [40 degrees 4000S 174 degrees 0000E].
   MethodsWe used a spatially explicit, mechanistic microclimate model to
   predict hourly temperatures at five soil depths under two scenarios of
   climate warming. Using the predicted soil temperatures as input to a
   biophysical model of temperature-dependent embryonic development, we
   estimated incubation temperatures and corresponding hatchling sex ratios
   for tuatara, a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination, at
   a submetre horizontal spatial resolution. We then applied ordinary
   kriging, a robust method of geostatistical interpolation, to estimate
   predictions throughout the full extent of our study location, an
   additional 480,000+ microsites, and validated the interpolation against
   an independent set of predictions.
   ResultsOrdinary kriging accurately predicted spatial variability in
   incubation temperatures. Mean predictions were similar between methods,
   and error in the geospatial model generally decreased with increasing
   soil depth. Error was higher for the geospatial model of the maximum
   warming', compared with the minimum warming', scenario of climate
   change.
   Main conclusionsOur results show that ordinary kriging can be a reliable
   method for interpolating variability in high-resolution predictions.
   However, the effects of error on the accuracy of interpolated
   predictions will become more severe as values approach a physiological
   threshold, such as the minimum and maximum incubation temperatures that
   result in extreme sex ratio bias. For distribution models, the widths of
   geographic areas predicted to be suitable for, in this case, maintaining
   balanced sex ratios, compared to those predicted to be unsuitable, may
   be narrower than in reality.

AB Appreciation of chronotherapy in hypertension continues to lag, despite
   clear demonstrations by many studies of (i) clinically relevant
   dosing-time differences of the beneficial and adverse effects of most
   blood pressure (BP) medications and (ii) significant association between
   reduced sleep-time BP decline of non-dippers and their heightened risk
   of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Syst-Eur and HOPE outcome trials
   showed evening administration of nitrendipine and ramipril in these
   respective studies impacts sleep-time BP, converting the 24-h BP pattern
   to a more dipper one and in the HOPE study decreasing CVD risk. The
   CONVINCE study intended to compare BP control and CVD protection
   afforded by conventional beta-blocker and diuretic medications versus a
   special drug-delivery verapamil formulation as a bedtime hypertension
   chronotherapy; however, the trial was terminated prematurely, not based
   on inadequate performance of the chronotherapy but on a corporate
   business decision. The just completed MAPEC study is the first trial
   specifically designed to prospectively test the hypothesis that bedtime
   administration of >= 1 conventional medications exerts better BP control
   and CVD risk reduction than the traditional approach of scheduling all
   medications in the morning. The results of this 5.6-yr median follow-up
   study establish that bedtime chronotherapy more effectively improves BP
   control, better decreases prevalence of non-dipping, and, most
   importantly, best reduces CVD morbidity and mortality. This
   chronotherapeutic approach to hypertension is justified by the fact that
   BP is usually lowest at night as is sodium excretion, but when sodium
   intake is excessive or its daytime excretion hampered, nocturnal BP is
   adjusted higher, to a level required for compensation overnight, via the
   pressure/natriuresis mechanism, resulting in non-dipping 24-h BP
   patterning. In diurnally active persons, the entire circadian BP pattern
   may be reset to a lower mean level and to a "more normal" day-night
   variation, simply by enhancing natriuresis during the night-the
   time-of-day when it can be most effective. A modification as simple and
   inexpensive as switching >= 1 hypertension medications from morning to
   evening may be all that is needed to normalize nighttime BP, exerting an
   effect exactly like sodium restriction. Current clinical concepts such
   as "normotensive nondipper" (with higher CVD risk than a hypertensive
   dipper), broad recommendation of pharmacotherapy with exclusively high
   "smoothness index" medications (without attention to individual patient
   needs defined by the features of the 24-h BP pattern), and reliance upon
   static daytime diagnostic BP thresholds based solely on single office
   cuff assessment necessitate urgent reconsideration. (Author

AB Proximity to membranes is required of actin networks for many key cell
   functions, including mechanics and motility. However, F-actin rigidity
   should hinder a filament's approach to surfaces. Using confocal
   microscopy, we monitor the distribution of fluorescent actin near
   nonadherent glass surfaces. Initially uniform, monomers polymerize to
   create a depletion zone where F-actin is absent at the surface but
   increases monotonically with distance from the surface. At its largest,
   depletion effects can extend >35 mu m, comparable with the average,
   mass-weighted filament length. Increasing the rigidity of actin
   filaments with phalloidin increases the extent of depletion, whereas
   shortening filaments by using capping protein reduces it proportionally.
   In addition, depletion kinetics are faster with higher actin
   concentrations, consistent with faster polymerization and faster
   Brownian-ratchet-driven motion. Conversely, the extent of depletion
   decreases with actin concentration, suggesting that entropy is the
   thermodynamic driving force. Quantitatively, depletion kinetics and
   extent match existing actin kinetics, rigidity, and lengths. However,
   explaining depletion profiles and concentration dependence (power-law of
   -1) requires modifying the rigid rod model. Within cells, surface
   depletion should slow membrane-associated F-actin reactions another
   approximate to 10-fold beyond hydrodynamically slowed diffusion of
   filaments (approximate to 10-fold). In addition, surface depletion
   should cause membranes to bend spontaneously toward filaments. Such
   depletion principles underlie the thermodynamics of all
   surface-associated reactions with mechanical structures, ranging from
   DNA to filaments to networks. For various functions, cells must actively
   resist the thermodynamics of depletion.

   than in 2005, while calculations of the temperature sensitivity (Q(10))
   values were similar in the two years. Daytime average respiration values
   were lower than the corresponding, temperature-corrected respiration
   rates calculated from night-time chamber measurements. From June to
   September, the season-integrated estimates of chamber photosynthesis and
   respiration were 384 and 590 g C m-2, respectively in 2006, an increase
   of 100 and 203 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in 2005. The
   season-integrated photosynthesis and respiration rates obtained using
   the eddy covariance technique, which included trees and a tall shrub not
   present in the chambers, were 720 and 513 g C m-2, respectively, in
   2006, an increase of 50 and 125 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in
   2005. While both photosynthesis and respiration rates were higher in the
   warmer and drier conditions of 2006, the increase in respiration was
   more than twice the increase in photosynthesis.

AB Geographical and temporal variations in body size are common phenomena
   among organisms and may evolve within a few years. We argue that body
   size acts much like a barometer, fluctuating in parallel with changes in
   the relevant key predictor(s), and that geographical and temporal
   changes in body size are actually manifestations of the same drivers.
   Frequently, the principal predictors of body size are food availability
   during the period of growth and ambient temperature, which often affects
   food availability. Food availability depends on net primary productivity
   that, in turn, is determined by climate and weather (mainly temperature
   and precipitation), and these depend mainly on solar radiation and other
   solar activities. When the above predictors are related to latitude the
   changes have often been interpreted as conforming to Bergmann's rule,
   but in many cases such interpretations should be viewed with caution due
   to the interrelationships among various environmental predictors. Recent
   temporal changes in body size have often been related to global warming.
   However, in many cases the above key predictors are not related to
   either latitude and/or year, and it is the task of the researcher to
   determine which particular environmental predictor is the one that
   determines food availability and, in turn, body size. The chance of
   discerning a significant change in body size depends to a large extent
   on sample size (specimens/year). The most recent changes in body size
   are probably phenotypic, but there are some cases in which they are
   partly genetic.

AB We used daily acoustic estimates of the abundance and range of a
   migratory demersal species, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), coupled with
   catch statistics from a mobile gillnet fishery in the northern Gulf of
   St. Lawrence, to verify two predictions of the Paloheimo-Dickie
   hypothesis:  (1) that biomass and range of fish distributions are
   positive covariates and (2) that catchability (q) is negatively
   correlated with biomass and occupied range.  Fishing power changed
   little during this study (1985-86) and was thus not a major cause of
   variation in q.  The daily biomass (b) of cod surveyed on the fishing
   ground was significantly and positively correlated with the range
   occupied (a) in both 1985 and 1986 (b = 86a1.05; R2 = 0.71; P < 0.05). 
   Local cod densities assessed at small scales (1 km) were relatively
   stable.  Daily catchability was a negative multiplicative function of
   both biomass (q = 0.095b-0.787; R2 = 0.70; P < 0.05) and occupied range
   (q = 0.003a-0.747; R2 = 0.56; P < 0.05).  The q-range relationship
   derived in 1986 was used to hindcast q in 1985.  Hindcast and observed
   1985 q's were significantly correlated (r = 0.74; P < 0.05).

AB Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis) are key
   fishes in the Arctic marine ecosystem, serving as important trophic
   links between plankton and apex predators, yet our understanding of
   their life histories in Alaska's Arctic is extremely limited. To improve
   our knowledge about their early life stages (ELS), we described the
   spatial and temporal distributions of preflexion larvae to late
   juveniles (to 65mm in length) in the Chukchi and western Beaufort seas
   based on surveys conducted between 2004 and 2013, and examined how their
   abundances varied in response to environmental factors. Species-specific
   differences in habitat use were found, with polar cod having a more
   offshore and northern distribution than saffron cod, which were found
   closer inshore and farther south. Polar cod preflexion and flexion
   larvae were encountered throughout the sampling season across much of
   the shelf, which suggests that spawning occurs over several months and
   at multiple locations, with Barrow Canyon potentially serving as an
   important spawning and/or retention area. Polar cod ELS were abundant at
   intermediate temperatures (5.0-6.0 degrees C), while saffron cod were
   most abundant at the highest temperatures, which suggests that saffron
   cod may benefit from a warming Arctic, while polar cod may be adversely
   affected. This research provides new insights into how environmental
   variability influences the distribution and abundance of gadids in the
   Pacific Arctic and advances our understanding of the habitats occupied
   by these key forage species during their first few months of life.

AB Abiotic and biotic factors control ecosystem biodiversity, but their
   relative contributions remain unclear. The ultraoligotrophic ecosystem
   of the Antarctic Dry Valleys, a simple yet highly heterogeneous
   ecosystem, is a natural laboratory well-suited for resolving the abiotic
   and biotic controls of community structure. We undertook a
   multidisciplinary investigation to capture ecologically relevant biotic
   and abiotic attributes of more than 500 sites in the Dry Valleys,
   encompassing observed landscape heterogeneities across more than 200
   km(2). Using richness of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa as a proxy
   for functional complexity, we linked measured variables in a
   parsimonious yet comprehensive structural equation model that explained
   significant variations in biological complexity and identified
   landscape-scale and fine-scale abiotic factors as the primary drivers of
   diversity. However, the inclusion of linkages among functional groups
   was essential for constructing the best-fitting model. Our findings
   support the notion that biotic interactions make crucial contributions
   even in an extremely simple ecosystem.

AB Little is known about the energy conservation strategies of free-ranging
   marsupials living in resource-poor Australian deserts. We studied
   activity patterns and torpor of free-living mulgaras (Dasycercus blythi)
   in arid central Australia during the winter of 2006. Mulgaras are small
   (similar to 75 g), nocturnal, insectivorous marsupials, with a patchy
   distribution in hummock grasslands. Mulgaras (six males, three females)
   were implanted intraperitoneally with temperature-sensitive transmitters
   and monitored for 6-55 d. Temperature profiles for different
   microhabitats and the thermal properties of soil and a number of burrows
   were also measured. Air temperature ranged from -3 degrees C at night to
   30 degrees C during the day. Although burrows buffered temperature
   extremes, the thermal diffusivity of the sandy soil was high, and many
   burrows were shallow. Hence, soil and burrow temperatures averaged about
   15 degrees C. The activity of mulgaras was often restricted to a few
   hours after sunset, before they retired into their burrows. Mulgaras
   employed torpor frequently, often entering torpor during the night and
   arousing around midday, with arousals occurring later on cooler days.
   Shallow burrows allowed cooling below mean T-soil. Consequently, body
   temperatures as low as 10.8 degrees C were observed. The longest torpor
   bout was 20.8 h. Torpor patterns changed seasonally and differed between
   males and females. From June to August, females entered torpor almost
   daily despite mating and gestation, but from the end of the gestation
   period onward, they remained normothermic. In contrast, males showed
   only shallow and short torpor during the mating season, but from
   mid-July, a transition to more frequent and deeper torpor resembling
   that of females was observed. Apparently, in both sexes, the
   reproductive effort entails energetic costs, but torpor, as an
   energy-saving mechanism, and reproduction are not exclusive in mulgaras.
   In a resource-poor environment during the least productive part of the
   year, frequent torpor seems to provide the means to compensate for the
   increased energetic costs associated with reproduction.

AB We evaluated the effects of hourly variation in flow caused by power
   load following at Glen Canyon Dam ("hydropeaking") on the nearshore
   habitat use and growth of age-0 rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss
   downstream from the dam in the Colorado River, Arizona. Reduction in the
   extent of hydropeaking is a common element of restoration efforts in
   regulated rivers, but empirical support for such a practice is limited.
   Our assessment was based on a comparison of abundance in shoreline areas
   determined by electrofishing at different flows as well as analysis of
   otolith microstructure. The catch rates of age-0 rainbow trout in
   nearshore areas were at least two- to fourfold higher at the daily
   minimum flow than at the daily maximum, indicating that most age-0
   rainbow trout do not maintain their position within immediate shoreline
   areas when flows are high. A striping pattern, identified by the
   presence of atypical daily increments formed every 7 d, was evident in
   over 50% of the 259 otoliths examined in 2003 but in only 6% of the 334
   examined in 2004. The weekly pattern corresponded to a reduction in the
   extent of hourly flow fluctuations on Sundays during the growing season,
   which occurred in 2003 but not in 2004. The atypical increments were 25%
   wider than the adjacent increments and were indicative of significant
   (F(15.235) = 19.2, P < 0.0001) short-term increases in otolith growth.
   The somatic growth rate among fish with otoliths where striping was
   present (11.2 mm/month) was slightly greater than that among fish with
   otoliths without striping (10.8 mm/month), but the difference was not
   significant. We provide evidence suggesting that otolith growth improved
   on Sundays in 2003 because it was the only day of the week when most
   age-0 fish were found in immediate shoreline areas, where higher water
   temperatures and lower velocities provided better growing conditions.

AB Past environmental changes based on diatom relative abundances have been
   inferred from the maar Lake Erlongwan in northeast China. The limnology
   of Lake Erlongwan is affected by the strongly seasonal regional climate.
   The composition of diatom assemblages, in turn, responds to changes in
   the seasonal duration of ice cover in winter, water-column turnover in
   spring and autumn, and thermal stratification in summer. Statistical
   analysis of the sedimentary diatom assemblages reveals three significant
   stratigraphic zones over the past 1000 yr. The highest abundance of the
   planktonic species Discostella species occurs between AD 1050 and 1400
   and suggests an annual ice-free period of long duration and
   well-developed summer stratification of the water column. This
   planktonic diatom peak between ca. AD 1150 and 1200 suggests that this
   period was the warmest over the past 1000 yr. The interval between AD
   1400 and 1800 is marked by a decline in planktonic diatoms and suggests
   shorter duration of the ice-free season, weaker water stratification and
   possibly generally cold conditions. After AD 1800 relative abundances of
   planktonic diatoms, including Puncticulata praetermissa and Asterionella
   formosa, increase again, which indicates lengthening of the duration of
   the annual ice-free period and a stronger overturn of the water column.
   All these data imply that the pattern of the seasons is different
   between the MWP and the 20th century. (C) 2012 University of Washington.

AB There is growing interest in the integration of macroecology and
   palaeoecology towards a better understanding of past, present, and
   anticipated future biodiversity dynamics. However, the empirical basis
   for this integration has thus far been limited. Here we review prospects
   for a macroecology-palaeoecology integration in biodiversity analyses
   with a focus on marine microfossils [i.e. small (or small parts of)
   organisms with high fossilization potential, such as foraminifera,
   ostracodes, diatoms, radiolaria, coccolithophores, dinoflagellates, and
   ichthyoliths]. Marine microfossils represent a useful model system for
   such integrative research because of their high abundance, large
   spatiotemporal coverage, and good taxonomic and temporal resolution. The
   microfossil record allows for quantitative cross-scale research designs,
   which help in answering fundamental questions about marine biodiversity,
   including the causes behind similarities in patterns of latitudinal and
   longitudinal variation across taxa, the degree of constancy of observed
   gradients over time, and the relative importance of hypothesized drivers
   that may explain past or present biodiversity patterns. The inclusion of
   a deep-time perspective based on high-resolution microfossil records may
   be an important step for the further maturation of macroecology. An
   improved integration of macroecology and palaeoecology would aid in our
   understanding of the balance of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms
   that have shaped the biosphere we inhabit today and affect how it may
   change in the future.

AB Digitate shell morphologies have evolved repeatedly in planktonic
   foraminifera throughout the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. Digitate species
   are usually rare in fossil and modern assemblages but show increased
   abundance and diversity at times during the Cretaceous and middle
   Eocene. In this paper we discuss the morphology and stratigraphic
   distribution of digitate planktonic foraminifera and establish the
   isotopic depth ecology of fossil ones to draw parallels with modern
   counterparts. delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of six extinct and two
   modern digitate species, from six time slices (Cenomanian, Turonian,
   Eocene, Miocene, Pleistocene and Holocene) have similar isotopic depth
   ecologies, consistently registering the most negative delta C-13 and
   usually the most positive delta O-18 compared to coexisting species.
   These results indicate a similar deep, subthermocline (>150 m) habitat,
   characterized by lower temperatures, reduced oxygen, and enrichment of
   dissolved inorganic carbon. This is consistent with water-column
   plankton studies that provide insight into the depth preferences of the
   three modern digitate species; in over 70% of observations digitates
   occurred in nets below 150 m, and down to 2000 m. The correlation
   between digitate species and subsurface habitats across multiple epochs
   suggests that elongated chambers were advantageous for survival in a
   deep mesopelagic habitat, where food is usually scarce. Increased
   abundance and diversity of digitates in association with some early and
   mid-Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events, in middle Eocene regions of
   coastal and equatorial upwelling, and occasionally in some modern
   upwelling regions, suggests an additional link with episodes of enhanced
   ocean productivity associated with expansion of the oxygen minimum zone
   (OMZ). We suggest that the primary function of digitate chambers was as
   a feeding specialization that increased effective shell size and food
   gathering efficiency, for survival in a usually food-poor environment,
   close to the OMZ. Episodes of increased digitate abundance and diversity
   indicate expansion of the deep-water ecologic opportunity under
   conditions that were unfavorable to other planktonic species. Our
   results provide evidence of iterative evolution reflecting common
   functional constraints on planktonic foraminifera shell morphology
   within similar subsurface habitats. They also highlight the potential of
   digitate species to act as indicators of deep watermasses, especially
   where there was expansion of the OMZ.

AB When exotic species are introduced into new areas, establishment is a
   vital step in their invasion process. Therefore, overwintering
   strategies determine whether an exotic species from low latitudes can
   successfully invade middle- and high-latitude areas. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of nutrient and water drawdown on overwintering
   in an exotic aquatic plant from the tropical zone, Eichhornia crassipes,
   at the northern margin of its distribution in China. The population
   density, size of individuals, and the size and nitrogen concentration of
   overwintering organs (stem base) of E. crassipes that grew in
   high-nutrition water were greater than those that grew in low-nutrient
   water before winter. The overwinter survival rate of E. crassipes was
   significantly affected by the water level and nutrient. The thick and
   dense floating mat of E. crassipes can increase the temperature of water
   bodies; therefore, the overwinter survival rate of E. crassipes was
   higher in constant-water-level and high-nutrient treatment. In contrast,
   due to the loss of heat preservation provided by the floating mats and
   the low nitrogen concentration in the stem base, all individuals of E.
   crassipes died in constant-water-level and low-nutrient treatment. In
   the water-drawdown treatments, the stem base of E. crassipes was
   directly exposed to low-temperature air; therefore, the overwinter
   survival rate of E. crassipes was lower. Our results reveal that
   eutrophication can not only improve the competitiveness of E. crassipes
   but can also improve the survival rate of overwintering plants in
   temperate regions. Our study also suggests that removing nutrients from
   the water and regulating the water level can limit the invasion of E.
   crassipes in temperate and subtropical regions.

AB Food availability, which is often seasonal, is regarded as a key factor
   in the breeding success of seabirds. In oceanic tropical areas, the
   resources are mostly patchy and ephemeral at the surface, and the
   seasonality is less marked than at higher latitudes. Such a situation
   influences greatly the breeding strategies of the oceanic seabird
   species. We conducted a comparative study of the breeding phenology of
   the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata) in relation to the local and regional
   oceanographic conditions around the four major colonies (Europa, Juan de
   Nova, Lys and Bird Islands) of the southwest Indian Ocean. Over the
   1997-2003 period, around all the studied locations, the sea-surface
   temperature (SST) and the chlorophyll concentration in the Mozambique
   Channel and the Seychelles area showed clear seasonal differences
   related to the southern climate and the monsoon phenomena. The breeding
   activity is synchronized at each studied colony, but the timings are
   very different. Seasonal reproduction occurs in austral winter at Europa
   and Bird Island and in austral summer at Juan de Nova; at Lys Island the
   reproduction is non-seasonal. For the seasonal colonies, there is a
   large monthly change in SST just before the beginning of reproduction,
   which is a proxy indicating the annual phytoplankton bloom. This
   variation is accompanied by the development of oceanic features such as
   fronts that favour aggregation of prey, and may also play an important
   role in the presence of schools of surface tuna, which are very
   important for the foraging success of sooty terns. Conversely, around
   Lys Island the seasonal variations of the marine environment do not lead
   to pronounced development of oceanic structures, and consequently, the
   longer-lasting phytoplankton bloom could explain the nonseasonal
   breeding regime there. Further studies will help discern the advantages
   and disadvantages of seasonal and nonseasonal reproduction regime in
   response to unpredictable fluctuations of the marine environment. (c)

   Jones are described. Average (range) of body lengths of a laboratory
   colony (Van Ryn) were 0.45 (0.43-0.48) mm for eggs, 0.72 (0.39-0.92) mm
   for L1, 1.8 (1.3-2.2) mm for L2, 3.6 (2.2-5.0) mm for L3, and 5.9
   (5.0-6.9) mm for L4. Head capsule lengths were 0.067 (0.064-0.070) mm
   for L1, 0.100 (0.094-0.110) for L2, 0.157 (0.144-0.168) for L3, and
   0.316 (0.300-0.324) mm for L4. Wild and colony L4 larvae differed in
   many standard metrics such as head length or width, but head ratios and
   pharyngeal armature measurements were comparable. Standard external and
   internal features of the head capsule are described. Scanning electron
   microscope photos revealed pharyngeal armature structure was similar for
   L2-L4. The pharyngeal armature and piercing mandibles suggest a
   generalist feeder and opportunistic predator. Egg ansullae were randomly
   distributed (as opposed to rows in most other Culicoides spp.) and
   averaged 1.98 ansullae per 25 mu m(2) of egg surface. Ansullae were
   widened and porous apically, averaging 1.29 microns long, 0.65 mu m at
   the base, and 1.06 mu m at the apex. Only the L1 had a proleg,
   structurally complex, and featuring five rows of posteriorily directed,
   shorter spines (1-3 mu m long) and 8-10 setae 18 mu m long with hooked
   tips. On terrestrial mud, this proleg was used for surface crawling, and
   the L1 navigated dry conditions better than the more aquatic L2-L4
   stages. Eggs are laid above waterline, and the L1 proleg is probably an
   advantage in terrestrial surface movement.

AB The abundance of lotic salmonids varies substantially through time, but
   the extent to which several sympatric species respond coherently to
   large-scale bioclimatic conditions has rarely been investigated for
   freshwater fishes. We compared correlations in salmonid density in
   central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid
   density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as
   indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and
   the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate
   for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The
   average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly
   synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed
   by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8
   of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon
   redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance
   of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times
   applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook
   trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence
   of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for
   Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most
   important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O.
   mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of
   westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from
   1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish
   density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the
   bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale
   factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in
   central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a
   more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the
   tractability of large systems to management control. However, causal
   mechanisms are hard to infer and require further research (e.g., the
   effects of ocean conditions). Our study provides a basis for such work.

AB Despite reductions in nitrogen loadings from wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) discharging into Long Island Sound (LIS) over the last 15 yr,
   eutrophication and hypoxia remain a severe problem. Here we used time
   series of hydrography, meteorology, nutrients, and phytoplankton
   pigments to explore the relationships between planktonic biomass,
   nutrient stocks, and physical regimes in LIS. With the exception of the
   most eutrophied station in the west, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)
   decreased between 1995 and 2009, likely resulting from WWTP upgrades.
   However, total dissolved nitrogen increased during this period,
   primarily driven by rising organic nitrogen pools. Simultaneous
   increases in inorganic phosphorus, silicate, and chlorophyll a (chl a)
   were also observed. Starting in 2002, pigment-based phytoplankton
   community composition revealed systematic declines in diatom abundances
   coincident with increases in dinoflagellates and other flagellated
   phytoplankton groups. Despite this, bottom water dissolved oxygen
   concentrations did not improve. The apparent paradox between increasing
   DIN limitation and escalating chl a concentrations in LIS suggests a
   shifting nutrient stoichiometry and an altered phytoplankton community
   in which phytoflagellates have increased in abundance relative to
   diatoms. Despite these changes, diatoms remained the most abundant algal
   group by the end of the study. In addition, a shift in chl a stocks in
   the year 2000 coincided with decreases in temperature, increases in
   salinity, and the proliferation of several algal groups. These results
   reveal the complex nature of eutrophied estuaries and indicate that
   policies targeting only inorganic nitrogen loadings may be insufficient
   to mitigate eutrophication in systems such as LIS.

AB Aims
   Seagrasses provide a variety of ecosystem goods and services, but they
   are subjected to frequently anthropogenic disturbances. In this study,
   we genotyped samples collected from Zostera japonica meadows with
   dramatic fluctuations in the area in order to understand the
   distribution of genetic variation within and among populations.
   Methods
   We collected samples from eight extant populations along coastal areas
   of southern China. Ten polymorphic microsatellites were adopted to
   genotype the samples. Parameters of genetic diversity and
   differentiation were calculated with general software.
   Important Findings
   High levels of genetic diversity were found in the studied populations,
   suggesting that the effective population size has not decreased
   significantly, which was supported by no signs of recent bottlenecks.
   High genetic diversity reflects an important role of sexual seedling
   recruitment in Z japonica populations. We found a significant
   relationship between genetic differentiation and the shortest sea
   surface distance of populations, suggesting that ocean currents play a
   critical role in shaping the genetic structure of Z japonica
   populations. STRUCTURE software analysis clustered the eight populations
   into two groups: western and eastern populations separated by the
   Qiongzhou Strait/Leizhou Peninsula, hinting that there was very limited
   gene flow through the narrow strait in this marine plant. Four
   populations had high contribution diversity and, thus, high priority for
   in situ conservation.

AB The thermal challenge associated with cold acclimation (CA) and
   hibernation requires effective cardio-respiratory function over a large
   range of temperatures. We examined the impact of acute cooling in a
   cold-naive hibernator to quantify the presumed improvement in
   cardio-respiratory dysfunction triggered by CA, and estimate the role of
   the autonomic nervous system in optimising cardiac and respiratory
   function. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were held at a 12h: 12h
   light: dark photoperiod and room temperature (21 degrees C euthermic
   control) or exposed to simulated onset of winter in an environmental
   chamber, by progression to 1h:23. h light: dark and 4 degrees C over 4.
   weeks. In vivo acute cooling (core temperature T-b=25 degrees C) in
   euthermic controls led to a hypotension and bradycardia, but preserved
   cardiac output. CA induced a hypertension at normothermia (T-b=37
   degrees C) but on cooling led to decreases in diastolic pressure below
   euthermic controls and a decrease in cardiac output, despite an increase
   in left ventricular conductance. Power spectral analysis of heart rate
   variability suggested a decline in vagal tone on cooling euthermic
   hamsters (T-b=25 degrees C). Following CA, vagal tone was increased at
   T-b= 37 degrees C, but declined more quickly on cooling (T-b= 25 degrees
   C) to preserve vagal tone at levels similar to euthermic controls at
   T-b= 37 degrees C. For the isolated heart, CA led to concentric
   hypertrophy with decreased end-diastolic volume, but with no change in
   intrinsic heart rate at either 37 or 25 degrees C. Mechanical impairment
   was noted at 37 degrees C following CA, with peak developed pressure
   decreased by 50% and peak rate-pressure product decreased by 65%; this
   difference was preserved at 25 degrees C. For euthermic hearts, coronary
   flow showed thermal sensitivity, decreasing by 65% on cooling (T= 25
   degrees C). By contrast, CA hearts had low coronary flow compared with
   euthermic controls, but with a loss of thermal sensitivity. Together,
   these observations suggest that CA induced a functional impairment in
   the myocardium that limits performance of the cardiovascular system at
   euthermia, despite increased autonomic input to preserve cardiac
   function. On acute cooling this autonomic control was lost and cardiac
   performance declined further than for cold-nave hamsters, suggesting
   that CA may compromise elements of cardiovascular function to facilitate
   preservation of those more critical for subsequent rewarming.

   the relevant circulation types produced by the Lamb classification
   scheme for the base period 1975-2000. Overall, model results illustrated
   good agreement with the reanalysis, albeit with a tendency to
   underestimate cyclonic (C) and southeasterly (SE) patterns and to
   overestimate anticyclones and directional flows. We also investigated
   future projections for each circulation-type during the rainy season
   (December-May) using three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),
   comprising RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Overall, two scenarios (RCP4.5
   and RCP 8.5) revealed a statistically significant increase in weather
   types favoring above normal rainfall in the region (e.g., C and
   E-types). In contrast, weather types associated with lower amounts of
   rainfall (e.g., anticyclones) are projected to decrease in winter but
   increase in spring. For all scenarios, there was consistent agreement on
   the sign of change (i.e., positive/negative) for the most frequent
   patterns (e.g., C, SE, E and A-types), whereas the sign was uncertain
   for less recurrent types (e.g., N, NW, SE, and W). The projected changes
   in weather type frequencies in the region can be viewed not only as
   indicators of change in rainfall response but may also be used to inform
   impact studies pertinent to water resource planning and management,
   extreme weather analysis, and agricultural production.

AB Sedentary passerine birds living in temperate and boreal regions need a
   high metabolic capacity for thermogenesis to survive winter conditions.
   As a consequence of the increased thermogenic capacity, basal energetic
   demands rise at a time when resources and time to acquire them decrease.
   In a previous study, great tits (Parus major) from two localities in
   Fennoscandia with contrasting winter conditions differed in their
   metabolic response to ambient temperature. To investigate the
   physiological basis underlying interpopulation differences we performed
   a common-garden experiment to test whether these differences were
   genetically based. We found basal metabolic rate to be higher in birds
   originating from transferred eggs from the southern population compared
   to the ones from the northern population, contrary to the relationship
   among birds living in their region of origin. Despite previous evidence
   suggesting that gene flow prevents local adaptation at the northern
   range limits of a species expanding northward, we found that great tits
   differ in their reaction norm to winter conditions according to the
   population of origin.

AB As climate change and invasive species, both individually and in
   concert, continue to elicit responses in native communities, we are
   challenged with finding strategies for predicting the strength of such
   impacts. The effects of invasive species are often determined by their
   abundance, and warming temperatures can alter species' demographic rates
   and, thus, population growth rates. Here, we combined lab experiments,
   field experiments and observations, and population modeling to predict
   the population dynamics of three marine invaders in response to climate
   warming. We projected population growth rate at an ambient and an
   increased temperature predicted by climate-change scenarios (+4 degrees
   C) for three invasive species in the epibenthic fouling community of
   Bodega Harbor, California, USA: the tunicates Botrylloides violaceus and
   Botryllus schlosseri and the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata. There was
   a positive effect of temperature on population growth rate for B.
   schlosseri, and further analysis revealed that this predicted increase
   was driven by warming effects on settler growth rate and adult
   fecundity. Increases indicated for non-native marine fouling species are
   especially pertinent when considering the potential cascading effects on
   community composition and functioning that can result from species
   invasions. Our results highlight the potential for marked increases in
   an invasive species in response to climate change, as well as the
   promising role that population modeling can play in elucidating the
   mechanisms of such responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Long-term urban carbon cycle studies remain rare despite the importance
   of carbon for energy, air quality, and climate change. To study spatial
   and temporal variations of energy and carbon fluxes in a subtropical
   urban environment, eddy covariance flux measurements were conducted
   north of downtown Houston, TX, using a tall radio-tower installation.
   The results of the first 2 yr of measurements show that both
   concentrations and fluxes of CO2 display typical seasonal and diurnal
   variations in urban areas. The seasonal variation of net CO2 flux is
   driven by steady anthropogenic emissions dominated by car traffic and
   human respiration, moderated by the local deciduous tree foliage.
   Weekday-weekend differences were observed in carbon fluxes, but not
   concentrations, while diurnal changes were dominated by rush-hour peaks
   from traffic and vegetation influences. Interestingly, CO and CO2
   concentrations, but not CO2 flux, exhibited long-term declines,
   especially comparing pre-and post-Hurricane Ike periods. A directional
   analysis of CO2 fluxes revealed that the highest fluxes typically
   occurred from northwest directions, most likely due to emissions from
   small industrial sources. Car traffic as carbon source was revealed via
   correlations of CO with CO2 during the morning rush hours, and of CO2
   flux with traffic counts during winter time. The influence of urban
   vegetation on net CO2 fluxes was identified via correlations with
   daytime photosynthetically active radiation due to photosynthesis, and
   with nighttime temperatures due to ecosystem respiration. The study site
   is a net source of CO2 throughout all seasons.

AB The power of sclerochronology as a tool for interpreting the life
   history of aquatic organisms and the marine environment they inhabited
   lies in the occurrence of periodic and repeating structures within the
   skeletal parts of these organisms. Previous work examining the internal
   growth patterns of northern quahog (=hard clams), Mercenaria mercenaria
   (L.), along the Atlantic Coast has established their periodicity;
   however, the two existing descriptions of the annual growth pattern for
   hard clams from Narragansett Bay, RI are not consistent with one
   another. One study identified a translucent slow growth band in the
   summer and the winter, whereas the other study identified a translucent
   slow growth band only in the winter. To facilitate future
   sclerochronological analyses using Narragansett Bay hard clams,
   variations in the existing descriptions of the annual growth pattern
   were clarified. We found high variability in the annual growth pattern
   of M. mercenaria collected during the summers of 2005 and 2006. In
   approximately half the mature individuals observed, the winter growth
   breaks were separated by three bands, an opaque band of rapid growth in
   the spring, a translucent slow growth band in the summer, and a second
   opaque band of rapid growth in the fall. As these individuals approached
   senility, the pattern became compressed into two seasonal bands, a
   single opaque band of rapid growth in the spring and a single
   translucent band of slow growth encompassing both summer and fall.
   Growth in the remainder of the samples exhibited only two seasonal bands
   throughout the mature and senile period, an opaque band of rapid spring
   growth and a translucent band of slow growth throughout the summer and
   fall. To confirm the patterns observed, we analyzed delta O-18 from a
   subsample of shells. After placing the earlier descriptions and the
   current description of growth in Narragansett Bay hard clams in
   chronological order, it appears as though the changing environment of
   Narragansett Bay was reflected in the growth pattern of these clams.
   This study emphasizes the importance of validating annual growth
   patterns even in a region where the periodicity of the species has been
   confirmed. Changes in the marine environment may alter the patterns in
   the skeletal structures of aquatic organisms as well as their growth
   rates.

AB Life-history traits such as offspring size, number and sex ratio are
   affected by maternal feeding rates in many kinds of animals, but the
   consequences of variation in maternal diet quality (rather than
   quantity) are poorly understood. We manipulated dietary quality of
   reproducing female lizards (Amphibolurus muricatus; Agamidae), a species
   with temperature-dependent sex determination, to examine strategies of
   reproductive allocation. Females maintained on a poor-quality diet
   produced fewer clutches but massively (twofold) larger eggs with lower
   concentrations of yolk testosterone than did conspecific females given a
   high-quality diet. Although all eggs were incubated at the same
   temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with
   offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased
   sex ratios among their offspring. These responses to maternal nutrition
   generate a link between sex and offspring size, in a direction likely to
   enhance maternal fitness if large body size enhances reproductive
   success more in sons than in daughters (as seems plausible, given the
   mating system of this species). Overall, our results showthat sex
   determination in these animals is more complex, and responsive to a
   wider range of environmental cues, than that suggested by the
   classification of 'environmental sex determination'.

AB Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) projections are often put forth
   to aid resource managers in climate change-related decision making.
   However, interpreting model results and understanding their uncertainty
   can be difficult. Sources of uncertainty include embedded assumptions
   about atmospheric CO2 levels, uncertain climate projections driving
   DGVMs, and DGVM algorithm selection. For western Oregon and Washington,
   we implemented an Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS)
   decision support model using MC2 DGVM results to characterize biomass
   loss risk. MC2 results were driven by climate projections from 20
   General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs), under
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, with and
   without assumed fire suppression, for three different time periods. We
   produced maps of mean, minimum, and maximum biomass loss risk and
   uncertainty for each RCP / +/- fire suppression / time period. We
   characterized the uncertainty due to RCP, fire suppression, and climate
   projection choice. Finally, we evaluated whether fire or climate
   maladaptation mortality was the dominant driver of risk for each model
   run. The risk of biomass loss generally increases in current high
   biomass areas within the study region through time. The pattern of
   increased risk is generally south to north and upslope into the Coast
   and Cascade mountain ranges and along the coast. Uncertainty from
   climate future choice is greater than that attributable to RCP or +/-
   fire suppression. Fire dominates as the driving factor for biomass loss
   risk in more model runs than mortality. This method of interpreting DGVM
   results and the associated uncertainty provides managers with data in a
   form directly applicable to their concerns and should prove helpful in
   adaptive management planning.

AB Mimicry is considered a classic example of the elaborate adaptations
   that natural selection can produce, yet often similarity between
   Batesian (harmless) mimics and their unpalatable models is far from
   perfect. Variation in mimetic accuracy is a puzzle, as natural selection
   should favour mimics that are hardest to distinguish from their models.
   Numerous hypotheses exist to explain the persistence of inaccurate
   mimics, but most have rarely or never been tested against empirical
   observations from wild populations. One reason for this is the
   difficulty in measuring pattern similarity, a key aspect of mimicry.
   Here, we use a recently developed method, based on the distance
   transform of binary images, to quantify pattern similarity both within
   and among species for a group of hoverflies and their hymenopteran
   models. This allowed us to test three key hypotheses regarding
   inaccurate mimicry. Firstly, we tested the prediction that selection
   should be more relaxed in less accurate mimics, but found that levels of
   phenotypic variation are similar across most hoverfly species. Secondly,
   we found no evidence that mimics have to compromise between accuracy to
   multiple model species. However, we did find that darker-coloured
   hoverflies are less accurate mimics, which could lead to a trade-off
   between mimicry and thermoregulation in temperate regions. Our results
   shed light on a classic problem concerning the limitations of natural
   selection.

AB Altitudinal gradients provide excellent opportunities to study
   relationships between species distribution and climatic variables. We
   studied the species composition of 39 samples of moss-inhabiting
   diatoms, collected at 50 m intervals from 100-650 m above sea level. The
   samples contained a total of 130 diatom species, of which 51 occurred in
   10 or more samples. Altitude appeared to be the most important variable
   explaining variation in species composition. Of the 51 common species,
   33 showed a significant relationship with altitude. Although the
   majority of the latter declined with increasing altitude, for nine
   species the probability of occurrence first increased with increasing
   elevation, but decreased again at higher altitudes, and four species
   increased systematically with elevation. As a result, expected species
   richness per sample decreased from an estimated 43 at 100 m to 25
   species per sample at 650 m. Diatom distribution patterns proved to be
   suitable predictors of the altitudinal position of sample sites.
   Cross-validation yielded a strong relationship between predicted and
   observed altitudes.

AB The late Holocene histories of Walker Lake and the Carson Sink were
   reconstructed by synthesizing existing data in both basins along with
   new age constraints from key sites, supplemented with paleohydrologic
   modeling. The repeated diversions of the Walker River to the Carson Sink
   and then back to Walker Lake caused Walker Lake-level fluctuations
   spanning +/- 50 m. Low lake levels at about 1000, 750, and 300 cal yr BP
   are time correlative to the ages of fluvial deposits along the Walker
   River paleochannel, when flow was directed toward the Carson Sink. The
   timing and duration of large lakes in the Carson Sink were further
   refined using moisture-sensitive tree-ring chronologies. The largest
   lakes required a fourfold to fivefold increase in discharge spanning
   decades. Addition of Walker River flow to the Carson Sink by itself is
   inadequate to account for the required discharge. Instead, increases in
   the runoff coefficient and larger areas of the drainage basin
   contributing surface runoff may explain the enhanced discharge required
   to create these large lakes.

AB Background: Populations of Drosophila melanogaster show differences in
   many morphometrical traits according to their geographic origin. Despite
   the widespread occurrence of these differences in more than one
   Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the
   genetic basis of such variation are not fully understood. Thermal
   selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these
   differences.
   Results: In our work, we investigated several life history traits (body
   size, duration of development, preadult survival, longevity and
   productivity) in two tropical and two temperate natural populations of
   D. melanogaster recently collected, and in a temperate population
   maintained for twelve years at the constant temperature of 18 degrees C
   in the laboratory. In order to characterise the plasticity of these life
   history traits, the populations were grown at 12, 18, 28 and 31.2
   degrees C. Productivity was the fitness trait that showed clearly
   adaptive differences between latitudinal populations: tropical flies did
   better in the heat but worse in the cold environments with respect to
   temperate flies. Differences for the plasticity of other life history
   traits investigated between tropical and temperate populations were also
   found. The differences were particularly evident at stressful
   temperatures (12 and 31.2 degrees C).
   Conclusion: Our results evidence a better cold tolerance in temperate
   populations that seems to have been evolved during the colonisation of
   temperate countries by D. melanogaster Afrotropical ancestors, and
   support the hypothesis of an adaptive response of plasticity to the
   experienced environment.

AB Tree-ring data can be used to provide high-resolution records of climate
   variability in areas like the Tengger Desert where few other records
   exist. In the present work, three tree-ring-width chronologies in the
   Luoshan Mountains in north-western China showed synchronous variation.
   These were averaged to develop a comprehensive chronology that was then
   used to reconstruct the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) since 1897
   AD for the grid point N 38 degrees 45', E 103 degrees 45' in the Tengger
   Desert. The annual PDSI and tree-ring widths in the Changlingshan
   Mountains at the southern margin of the Tengger Desert matched well (r =
   0.50, p < 0.001), indicating the reliability of the reconstruction. The
   annual PDSI dry and wet periods were consistent with recorded lake
   sediments in the northern Mu Us Desert. The dry periods in the Tengger
   Desert were compatible with the relatively low PDSI in the Ortindag Sand
   Land in eastern Inner Mongolia. Abrupt climate variability occurred
   around 1922, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, in line with abrupt changes in
   the Asian monsoon system in the 1930s. Distinct periods of about 2-4
   years and 5-7 years were evident in the reconstructed PDSI. (C) 2013

AB Vessels fishing with gill nets for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the
   northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1985 and 1986 concentrated their
   fishing effort in shallow waters (<50 m) where cod densities were
   highest (to 0.5/m(3)). In both years, seasonal trends (June-August) in
   mean daily deployment depths of gill nets were positively correlated
   with mean depths at which cod were surveyed (1985, r=0.71; 1986, r=0.51,
   P's <0.05). Daily catch rate variability of individual vessels was
   accounted for by fish ''flux'' adjacent to nets (44%), vessel operator
   skill (19%), and ''flux''-skill interaction (8%; total R(2)=0.71). A
   guided vessel directed to fish at sites predicted to have high fish flux
   (located down-current from h igh-density cod aggregations identified by
   echosounding within depth ranges forecast to be favorable to cod by
   ''rule of thumb'' wind-based oceanographic models) had higher catch
   rates (mean 1.3 t/d) than the fleet average and its own average fishing
   without guidance (means 0.4 t/d, P's <0.05). Directed searches were of
   shorter duration (mean 0.5 h) than searches conducted at random (1.5 h).
   Combined use of echosounders and air-sea-based forecasts of cod
   distribution could help stabilize catch rates, especially at times of
   poor fish availability inshore.

   strains (formerly Saccharomyces bayanus var. uvarum) in wine
   fermentation.
   Indigenous Saccharomyces spp. yeasts were isolated from Amarone wine
   (Italy) and analysed. Genotypes were correlated to phenotypes:
   Melibiose(-) and Melibiose(+) strains displayed a karyotype
   characterized by three and two bands between 225 and 365 kb,
   respectively. Two strains were identified by karyotype analysis (one as
   S. cerevisiae and the other as S. uvarum). The technological
   characterization of these two strains was conducted by
   microvinifications of Amarone wine. Wines differed by the contents of
   ethanol, residual sugars, acetic acid, glycerol, total polysaccharides,
   ethyl acetate, 2-phenylethanol and anthocyanins. Esterase and
   beta-glucosidase activities were assayed on whole cells during
   fermentation at 13 degrees and 20 degrees C. Saccharomyces uvarum
   displayed higher esterase activity at 13 degrees C, while S. cerevisiae
   displayed higher beta-glucosidase activity at both temperatures.
   The strains differed by important technological and qualitative traits
   affecting the fermentation kinetics and important aroma components of
   the wine.
   The contribution of indigenous strains of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum to
   wine fermentation was ascertained under specific winemaking conditions.
   The use of these strains as starters in a winemaking process could
   differently modulate the wine sensory characteristics.

AB The effect of temperature on mitochondrial performance is thought to be
   partly due to its effect on mitochondrial membranes. Numerous studies
   have shown that thermal acclimation and adaptation can alter the amount
   of inner-mitochondrial membrane (IMM), but little is known about the
   capacity of organisms to modulate mitochondrial membrane composition.
   Using northern and southern subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus
   heteroclitus) that are locally adapted to different environmental
   temperatures, we assessed whether thermal acclimation altered liver
   mitochondrial respiratory capacity or the composition and amount of IMM.
   We measured changes in phospholipid headgroups and headgroup-specific
   fatty acid (FA) remodeling, and used respirometry to assess
   mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Acclimation to 5 degrees C and 33
   degrees C altered mitochondrial respiratory capacity in both subspecies.
   Northern F. heteroclitus exhibited greater mitochondrial respiratory
   capacity across acclimation temperatures, consistent with previously
   observed subspecies differences in whole-organism aerobic metabolism.
   Mitochondrial phospholipids were altered following thermal acclimation,
   and the direction of these changes was largely consistent between
   subspecies. These effects were primarily driven by remodeling of
   specific phospholipid classes and were associated with shifts in
   metabolic phenotypes. There were also differences in membrane
   composition between subspecies that were driven largely by differences
   in phospholipid classes. Changes in respiratory capacity between
   subspecies and with acclimation were largely but not completely
   accounted for by alterations in the amount of IMM. Taken together, these
   results support a role for changes in liver mitochondrial function in
   the ectothermic response to thermal stress during both acclimation and
   adaptation, and implicate lipid remodeling as a mechanism contributing
   to these changes.

   vulgaris in the Strait of Sicily, central Mediterranean, are

   Annual distributions were generated for mature animals and juveniles for

   using an inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolation. Based on
   the persistence of abundant recruits and mature animals, respectively,
   nursery and spawning grounds were identified. The correlation between
   annual recruitment and SST during hatching and recruitment was also
   investigated. Concentrations of juveniles (nurseries) were located off
   the southwest coast of Sicily and in the central Strait of Sicily,
   including south of Lampedusa on the African shelf, but just one
   consistent concentration of mature animals (spawning grounds) was found
   in the northwestern part of the Strait. There was a significant positive
   correlation between recruitment and SST. Results are discussed in the
   light of environmental parameters, and a hypothesis on possible stock
   units in the area was developed. The direct and indirect effects of SST
   variation on the recruitment process were also examined.

AB Conservation efforts for threatened or endangered species are
   challenging because the multi-scale factors that relate to their decline
   or inhibit their recovery are often unknown. To further exacerbate
   matters, the perceptions associated with the mechanisms of species
   decline are often viewed myopically rather than across the entire
   species range. We used over 80years of fish presence data collected from
   the Great Plains and associated ecoregions of the United States, to
   investigate the relative influence of changing environmental factors on
   the historic and current truncated distributions of the Arkansas River
   shiner Notropis girardi. Arkansas River shiner represent a threatened
   reproductive ecotype considered especially well adapted to the harsh
   environmental extremes of the Great Plains. Historic (n=163 records) and
   current (n=47 records) species distribution models were constructed
   using a vector-based approach in MaxEnt by splitting the available data
   at a time when Arkansas River shiner dramatically declined. Discharge
   and stream order were significant predictors in both models; however,
   the shape of the relationship between the predictors and species
   presence varied between time periods. Drift distance (river fragment
   length available for ichthyoplankton downstream drift before meeting a
   barrier) was a more important predictor in the current model and
   indicated river segments 375-780km had the highest probability of
   species presence. Performance for the historic and current models was
   high (area under the curve; AUC>0.95); however, forecasting and
   backcasting to alternative time periods suggested less predictive power.
   Our results identify fragments that could be considered refuges for
   endemic plains fish species and we highlight significant environmental
   factors (e.g., discharge) that could be manipulated to aid recovery.

AB Sclerochronological records of interannual shell growth variability were
   established for eight modern shells (26 to 163 years of age) of the
   bivalve Arctica islandica, which were sampled at one site in the inner
   German Bight. The records indicate generally low synchrony between
   individuals. Spectral analysis of the whole 163-yr masterchronology
   indicated a cyclic pattern with a period of 5 and 7 years. The
   masterchronology correlated poorly to time series of environmental
   parameters over the last 90 years. High environmental variability in
   time and space of the dynamic and complex German Bight hydrographic
   system results in an extraordinarily high 'noise' level in the shell
   growth pattern of Arctica islandica.

AB Radiotelemetry has become a very popular biotelemetric tool for
   measuring physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure,
   body temperature and muscle activity, as well as general behavioural
   activity in undisturbed, freely moving animals. In most studies using
   this technique, adult subjects are used. However, sometimes an
   ontogenetic approach is required to clarify whether changes in one
   parameter are preceeded or followed by changes in another parameter.
   Tracking physiological changes in young, developing individuals could
   explain given states of these animals as adults. Implanting telemetry
   devices can be done subcutaneously and intraperitoneally, the former
   method posing less of a challenge on the animal and its recovery from
   surgery. Because telemetry will be used in weanling gerbils during
   subsequent studies, we needed to investigate whether subcutaneous
   implantation of telemetric devices is preferable to intraperitoneal
   surgery with respect to animal welfare. This is a technical paper
   describing anaesthetic and surgical techniques in detail during a
   pre-trial involving subcutaneous (n = 10, aged 21-29 days) and
   intraperitoneal (n = 10, aged 19-34 days) implantation of dummy
   telemetry transmitters (1.9 cm(3), 3.6 g after shortening of leads) in
   weanling gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus. Body weight was measured and
   analysed over four-day intervals. Optimizing anaesthetic dosages was a
   first step in this pilot trial. This occurred during the first few
   subcutaneous implantations. Three animals died while anaesthetized
   during the subcutaneous procedure but none post-surgery. All animals
   survived anaesthesia during the intraperitoneal implantation, but two
   died in the first three days post-surgery. In the former method, the
   tension on the dermal sutures caused by the presence of the transmitters
   was too great, resulting in the animals opening the sutures by chewing
   them. The animals died during the latter procedure probably due to
   strangulation of the intestine by the excess lead that was coiled in the
   abdomen. Furthermore, placement of the exposed negative lead of the
   transmitter on the underlying muscle had to be done on the m. pectoralis
   transversus in order for it to stay in place as the animal developed.
   This paper showed that the implantation of a telemetric device in
   weanling gerbils is feasible and is best executed through the
   intraperitoneal technique.

AB Variation of three morphological traits (thorax length, wing length and
   sternopleural bristle number) was examined in Drosophila melanogaster
   reared on a medium with low yeast content and on a standard medium using
   the isofemale line analysis and offspring-parent regression. The aim was
   to test whether these experimental approaches give different patterns of
   changes in genetic variability estimates when stressful and nonstressful
   environments are compared. Heritabilities and genetic and phenotypic
   variances were generally higher in the isofemale line design than in the
   offspring-parent regression design under both standard and poor
   nutritional conditions. For each trait, the response of heritability to
   stress was similar in both designs: wing length exhibited lower
   heritability under poor nutrition, whereas heritabilities of thorax
   length and sternopleural bristle number did not differ between
   nutritional regimes. Statistically significant differences in the
   genetic variances and the environmental variances between stressful and
   nonstressful environments were recorded only in isofemale lines: the
   genetic variance of thorax length and the environmental variances of
   thorax length and wing length were higher under poor nutrition. The
   results are compared to literature data and possible reasons of
   increased genetic variability estimates in isofemale lines are briefly
   discussed.

AB Behavioural thermoregulation has the potential to alleviate the
   short-term impacts of climate change on some small ectotherms, without
   the need for changes to species distributions or genetic adaptation. We
   illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate
   species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial
   and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments.
   Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging
   grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily
   period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the
   temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated
   and the subsequent reductions in body temperature. Behavioural means
   such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface
   temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments (e.g. stilting,
   vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective at maintaining
   preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily tolerated
   temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C,
   indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this species.
   Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small ectotherms to
   regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures and utilize the
   spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they occupy. Species
   such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to cool temperate
   conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond successfully to
   coarse scale climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pattern of increasing species body size with increasing latitude has
   been noticed in different groups of animals. Here, we used seven key
   environmental factors and independent contrasts to assess body size
   latitudinal clines in Cyprinidae at two phylogenetic levels (inter- and
   intragenera), which were defined using a genus-level supertree. Model
   selection procedures revealed that environmental factors shaping body
   size variation in Cyprinidae differed according to the phylogenetic
   scale considered. At the higher phylogenetic level, we found that both
   temperature (negative effect) and habitat availability (positive effect
   of drainage basin surface area) constituted mechanistic explanations of
   large-scale body size distribution. No temperature-related body size
   cline was observed at the intragenus level. Instead, competitive
   interaction (negative effect of species richness), habitat availability
   (positive effect of drainage basin surface area), migration ability and
   available energy (positive effects of glacial coverage and actual
   evapotranspiration) constitute alternative explanations at this lower
   phylogenetic scale. We conclude that (i) at the intergenus level,
   cyprinids do show a tendency to be smaller at high temperatures and
   larger at low temperatures, (ii) this tendency no longer exists at the
   intragenus level, (iii) latitude per se is a weak predictor of body size
   clines whatever the taxonomic level analysed, (iv) generalising
   geographical body size patterns may be rendered difficult by the
   superimposition of a series of mechanisms across different taxonomic
   scales, and (v) habitat size, here acting positively at both taxonomic
   scales, may play a major role in shaping riverine species body size
   clines.

AB Radiant spring frosts occurring during reproductive developmental stages
   can result in catastrophic yield loss for wheat producers. To better
   understand the spatial and temporal variability of frost, the occurrence
   and impact of frost events on rain-fed wheat production was estimated
   across the Australian wheatbelt for 1957-2013 using a 0.05 degrees
   gridded weather data set. Simulated yield outcomes at 60 key locations
   were compared with those for virtual genotypes with different levels of
   frost tolerance. Over the last six decades, more frost events, later
   last frost day, and a significant increase in frost impact on yield were
   found in certain regions of the Australian wheatbelt, in particular in
   the South-East and West. Increasing trends in frost-related yield losses
   were simulated in regions where no significant trend of frost occurrence
   was observed, due to higher mean temperatures accelerating crop
   development and causing sensitive post-heading stages to occur earlier,
   during the frost risk period. Simulations indicated that with
   frost-tolerant lines the mean national yield could be improved by up to
   20% through (i) reduced frost damage (similar to 10% improvement) and
   (ii) the ability to use earlier sowing dates (adding a further 10%
   improvement). In the simulations, genotypes with an improved frost
   tolerance to temperatures 1 degrees C lower than the current 0 degrees C
   reference provided substantial benefit in most cropping regions, while
   greater tolerance (to 3 degrees C lower temperatures) brought further
   benefits in the East. The results indicate that breeding for improved
   reproductive frost tolerance should remain a priority for the Australian
   wheat industry, despite warming climates.

AB Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus aggregate to feed in a regional
   upwelling system during November-May between the Great Australian Bight
   (GAB) and Bass Strait. We analysed sightings from aerial surveys over 6
   upwelling seasons (2001-02 to 2006-07) to assess within-season patterns
   of blue whale habitat selection, distribution, and relative abundance.
   Habitat variables were modelled using a general linear model (GLM) that
   ranked sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll (SSC)
   of equal importance, followed by depth, distance to shore, SSC gradient,
   distance to shelf break, and SST gradient. Further discrimination by
   hierarchical partitioning indicated that SST accounted for 84.4% of
   variation in blue whale presence explained by the model, and that
   probability of sightings increased with increasing SST. The large study
   area was resolved into 3 zones showing diversity of habitat from the
   shallow narrow shelf and associated surface upwelling of the central
   zone, to the relatively deep upper slope waters, broad shelf and
   variable upwelling of the western zone, and the intermediate features of
   the eastern zone. Density kernel estimation showed a trend in
   distribution from the west during November-December, spreading
   south-eastward along the shelf throughout the central and eastern zones
   during January-April, with the central zone most consistently utilised.
   Encounter rates in central and eastern zones peaked in February,
   coinciding with peak upwelling intensity and primary productivity. Blue
   whales avoided inshore upwelling centres, selecting SST similar to 1
   degrees C cooler than remotely sensed ambient SST. Whales selected
   significantly higher SSC in the central and eastern zones than the
   western zone, where relative abundance was extremely variable. Most
   animals departed from the feeding ground by late April.

AB AimsTo gain an understanding of the growth kinetics of Staphylococcus
   aureus to ensure the safety of pork, and to develop a predictive growth
   model of Staph.aureus in raw pork, ham and sausage pork under specific
   storage time and temperature conditions.
   Methods and ResultsGrowth of Staph.aureus was evaluated at 5-40 degrees
   C using 5-6 replicates in each sampling time in order to capture
   experimental variability. Growth curves were fit to Baranyi model to
   estimate Lag time () and maximum growth rate (max). The effect of
   temperature on and max was modelled using natural logarithm of and
   square root of max. The variability between repetitions was higher at
   15, 20 and 40 degrees C than observed at 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. After
   only 3 and 2days of storage at 5 and 10 degrees C, respectively,
   Staph.aureus populations decreased to limit of detection (1logCFUg(-1)).
   Staphylococcus aureus populations on ham presented higher max in
   comparison to those grown on raw pork and sausage. Linear regression
   lines showed that Staph.aureus populations in ham grew faster than those
   observed in sausage and raw pork. Staph.aureus presented a theoretical
   minimum growth temperature (T-min) depending on the processed pork
   products, which were different from in raw pork.
   ConclusionStaphylococcus aureus model predicts faster growth in ham
   compared to raw pork and sausage. The validation of models showed good
   predictions, suggesting that the developed models are useful in
   estimating growth kinetics of Staph.aureus in different pork products.
   Significance and Impact of this StudyEstablished here is a data-driven,
   in silico model on Staph.aureus growth kinetics on different pork
   products. The model is extensively validated by experiments and
   simulations and further supported by comparisons to previous modelling
   efforts in other species.

AB The Adh and alpha Gpdh allozyme loci (both located on the second
   chromosome) showed considerable fluctuations in allele frequencies in a
   seminatural population of Drosophila melanogaster during 1972-97. Both
   long-term and short-term fluctuations were observed. The short-term
   fluctuations occurred within almost all years and comparison of allele
   frequencies between winters and summers showed significantly higher
   Adh(S) (P < 0.001) and alpha Gpdh(F) (P < 0.01) allele frequencies in
   summers. Frequencies of these alleles were significantly positively
   correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting the adaptive
   significance of these allozyme polymorphisms. Frequency changes of the
   Odh locus (located on the third chromosome) showed no seasonal pattern
   and were not correlated with environmental temperature. Almost all
   short-term and long-term increases in Adh(S) frequency were accompanied
   by a corresponding decrease in alpha Gpdh(S) frequency (r = -0.82, P <
   0.001) and vice versa. Further analysis showed that gametic
   disequilibria between the Adh and alpha Gpdh loci, which frequently
   occurred, were due to the presence of inversion In(2L)t located on the
   same chromosome arm and In(2L)t frequencies were positively correlated
   with environmental temperature. Gametic disequilibria between Adh and
   Odh and between Odh and alpha Gpdh were hardly observed. Because In(2L)t
   is exclusively associated with the Adh(S)/alpha Gpdh(F) allele
   combination, the observed correlated response in Adh/alpha Gpdh allele
   frequencies is (at least partly) explained by hitchhiking effects with
   In(2L)t. This means that the adaptive value of the allozyme
   polymorphisms has been overestimated by ignoring In(2L)t polymorphism.
   Fluctuations in Adh allele frequencies are fully explained by selection
   on In(2L)f polymorphism, whereas we have shown that alpha Gpdh frequency
   fluctuations are only partly explained by chromosomal hitchhiking,
   indicating the presence of selective differences among aGpdh genotypes
   in relation with temperature and independent of In(2L)t. Frequency
   fluctuations of aGpdh and In(2L)t are consistent with their latitudinal
   distributions, assuming that temperature is the main environmental
   factor varying with latitude that causes directly or indirectly these
   frequency distributions. However, the results of the tropical greenhouse
   population show no correlation of Adh (independent of li?(2L)t) and Odh
   allele frequencies with environmental temperature, which may indicate
   that the latitudinal distribution in allele frequencies for these loci
   is not the result of selection on the FIS polymorphism in a direct way.

   representative of temperature conditions over a large area of Central

   are identified at 2.0-2.8 and 26.9 years. Our temperature reconstruction
   successfully captured most recent warming and agreed in general with

   temperature is significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in

AB The Chesapeake Bay region is projected to experience changes in
   temperature, sea level, and precipitation as a result of climate change.
   This research uses an estuarine-watershed hydrodynamic-biogeochemical
   modeling system along with projected mid-21st-century changes in
   temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise to explore the impact
   climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay dissolved-oxygen (DO)
   concentrations and the potential success of nutrient reductions in
   attaining mandated estuarine water quality improvements. Results
   indicate that warming bay waters will decrease oxygen solubility
   year-round, while also increasing oxygen utilization via respiration and
   remineralization, primarily impacting bottom oxygen in the spring.
   Rising sea level will increase estuarine circulation, reducing residence
   time in bottom waters and increasing stratification. As a result, oxygen
   concentrations in bottom waters are projected to increase, while oxygen
   concentrations at mid-depths (3 < DO < 5 mg L-1) will typically
   decrease. Changes in precipitation are projected to deliver higher
   winter and spring freshwater flow and nutrient loads, fueling increased
   primary production. Together, these multiple climate impacts will lower
   DO throughout the Chesapeake Bay and negatively impact progress towards
   meeting water quality standards associated with the Chesapeake Bay Total
   Maximum Daily Load. However, this research also shows that the potential
   impacts of climate change will be significantly smaller than
   improvements in DO expected in response to the required nutrient
   reductions, especially at the anoxic and hypoxic levels. Overall,
   increased temperature exhibits the strongest control on the change in
   future DO concentrations, primarily due to decreased solubility, while
   sea level rise is expected to exert a small positive impact and
   increased winter river flow is anticipated to exert a small negative
   impact.

AB A prerequisite to any attempt to reconstruct thermophysiology of ancient
   animals through analysis of stable isotopes of oxygen is the assumption
   that apatitic fossils are isotopically unaltered parts of their original
   skeletons. We suggest that sufficient evidence is available to seriously
   question this assumption. Because living bones contain about 1/3 by
   weight of organic matrix, mass balance considerations show that at least
   half of an apatitic fossil must be new material added post mortem.
   Furthermore, living apatitic skeletons contain almost no rare earth
   elements and uranium, whereas apatitic fossils bear high concentrations
   of these elements. Additionally we found that while in living fish
   correlation between delta(18)O of oxygen in the phosphate and that in
   the carbonate of apatite is poor, these two values are linearly
   correlated in fossil fish. This suggests diagenetic recrystallization
   has taken place. Perfect preservation of micro-textures such as
   Haversian canals does not prove the pristine condition of a fossil; some
   of the most beautifully preserved fossils are highly silicified. Most
   apatitic fossils probably are pseudomorphs replacing original skeletal
   elements. Whereas distribution of stable isotopes of oxygen in fossils
   might provide information about their burial environment, it could be
   misleading in attempts to interpret the organisms' physiology This
   cautionary note is supported by the similarity of delta(18)O(p) in bones
   of coexisting fossil fish, dinosaurs, and various other reptiles at
   different latitudes. The overlap of predicted delta(18)O(p) values in
   fish and mammals living in contact with the same environmental water
   also weakens the hope that ectotherms can be distinguished from
   endotherms by the isotopic composition of oxygen in their bones and
   teeth.

AB Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close congener S. paradoxtis are
   typically indistinguishable by the phenotypic criteria of classical
   yeast taxonomy, but they are evolutionarily distinct as indicated by
   hybrid spore inviability and genomic sequence divergence. Previous work
   has shown that these two species coexist in oak-associated microhabitats
   at natural woodland sites in North America. Here, we show that sympatric
   populations of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxtis from a single natural
   site are phenotypically differentiated in their growth rate responses to
   temperature. Our main finding is that the S. cerevisiae population
   exhibits a markedly higher growth rate at 37degreesC than the S.
   paradoxtis population; we also find possible differences in growth rate
   between these populations at two lower temperatures. We discuss the
   implications of our results for the coexistence of these yeasts in
   natural environments, and we suggest that thermal growth response may be
   an evolutionarily labile feature of these organisms that could be
   analyzed using genomic approaches. (C) 2003 Federation of European

AB Flow regimes have been fundamentally altered in many of the world's
   river systems. There is a need to restore components of natural flow
   variability to protect freshwater biodiversity. The Australian bass is a
   long-lived, catadromous percichthyid endemic to coastal drainages of
   south-eastern Australia. Little is known of the timing and magnitude of
   flows considered important for recruitment and growth of individuals in
   southern latitudes of the species range. Herein we generate nearly 50
   years of otolith-derived recruitment and growth histories for Australian
   bass and relate these to hydrologic, climatic and demographic variables.
   We found that younger Australian bass grew fastest in years following a
   cooler spring, whereas the growth of older fish exhibited little
   response to temperature. Australian bass year class strength was
   positively related to high flows in spring and in a negative curvilinear
   way to spring temperature. A lack of suitable natural flows in spring
   may be responsible for little to no recruitment of Australian bass in
   the Genoa River over the past two decades. Based on our findings, the
   continuing trend of lower rainfall and higher temperatures, coupled with
   river regulation in some systems in the region, will likely result in
   depressed juvenile growth and prolonged periods of recruitment failure
   over the medium to longer term, with significant implications for the
   viability of populations.

AB Population dynamics are affected by changes in both the mean and
   standard deviation of climate, e. g., changes in average temperature are
   likely to affect populations, but so are changes in the strength of
   year-to-year temperature variability. The impacts of increases in
   average temperature are extensively researched, while the impacts of
   changes in climate variability are less studied. Is the greater
   attention given to changes in mean environment justified? To help answer
   this question we developed a simple population model, explicitly linked
   to an environmental process. We used the model to compare the
   sensitivities of a population's long-term stochastic growth rate, a
   measure of fitness, to changes in the mean and standard deviation of the
   environment. Results are interpreted in light of a comparative analysis
   of the relative magnitudes of change in means and standard deviations of
   biologically relevant climate variables in the United States. Results
   show that changes in the variability of the environment can be more
   important for many populations. Changes in mean conditions are likely to
   have a greater impact than changes in variability on populations far
   from their ideal environment, for example, populations near species
   range boundaries and potentially of conservation concern. Populations
   near range centres and close to their ideal environment are more likely
   to be affected by changes in variability. Among pest and insect disease
   vectors, as well as species of commercial value, populations likely to
   be of greatest economic and public health significance are those near
   species range centers, living in a near-ideal environment for the
   species. Observed changes in the variability of climate variables may
   benefit these populations.

AB A central goal of population ecology is to identify the factors that
   regulate population growth. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in
   eastern North America re-colonize the breeding range over several
   generations that result in population densities that vary across space
   and time during the breeding season. We used laboratory experiments to
   measure the strength of density-dependent intraspecific competition on
   egg laying rate and larval survival and then applied our results to
   density estimates of wild monarch populations to model the strength of
   density dependence during the breeding season. Egg laying rates did not
   change with density but larvae at high densities were smaller, had lower
   survival, and weighed less as adults compared to lower densities. Using
   mean larval densities from field surveys resulted in conservative
   estimates of density-dependent population reduction that varied between
   breeding regions and different phases of the breeding season. Our
   results suggest the highest levels of population reduction due to
   density-dependent intraspecific competition occur early in the breeding
   season in the southern portion of the breeding range. However, we also
   found that the strength of density dependence could be almost five times
   higher depending on how many life-stages were used as part of field
   estimates. Our study is the first to link experimental results of a
   density-dependent reduction in vital rates to observed monarch densities
   in the wild and show that the effects of density dependent competition
   in monarchs varies across space and time, providing valuable information
   for developing robust, year-round population models in this migratory
   organism.

AB Freezing stress is a major factor affecting plant growth, crop
   productivity, and the geographical distribution of plants. To identify
   freezing-responsive genes in Brassica rapa, we analyzed transcriptome
   profiles of two contrasting inbred lines with different geographic
   origins, Chiifu and Kenshin, in control and -4 A degrees C-treated
   leaves. A total of 3,301 genes were differentially expressed between
   Chiifu and Kenshin upon freezing treatment. Among these, 67 and 1,633
   genes were specifically expressed in Chiifu and Kenshin, respectively.
   An ortholog (BrTPP1) of Arabidopsis trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase 1
   (TPP1) was specifically and highly induced in Chiifu by freezing
   treatment. However, most cold-responsive genes, including CBF
   pathway-related genes, showed similar patterns of expression between
   Chiifu and Kenshin. Many genes involved in stress responses (i.e., to
   freezing temperatures) were intrinsically and specifically expressed in
   Chiifu, which is tolerant of freezing temperatures. The results suggest
   that the CBF pathway is not the main factor conferring freezing
   tolerance to Chiifu, but genes that are expressed prior to cold
   acclimation, along with other regulatory genes, may play important roles
   in freezing tolerance.

AB Approximately 550 measurements of Mn/Ca ratios in three corals from the
   western Galapagos Islands have been performed to reconstruct a 380-year
   history of surface ocean variability with respect to this trace element.
   The time period studied encompasses 1600 A.D. to 1978. Manganese is
   inferred to be lattice-bound in coral-line aragonite at 10-50% of its
   seawater proportion to calcium; uncertainty about the distribution
   coefficient stems from inherent variability of oceanic Mn in near-shore
   settings. Interannual variations at Urvina Bay, Isabela Island are
   generally small, with the exception of a few decades during the
   nineteenth century. A large positive Mn/Ca anomaly found between
   1821-1830 is hypothesized to have resulted from a major volcanic
   eruption on nearby Fernandina Island in 1825. On intrannual timescales,
   a pronounced cycle occurs in response to seasonal upwelling. Quarterly
   changes in Mn/Ca are six months out-of-phase with Cd/Ca variations - a
   reflection of the opposite distributions of these metals in the upper
   waters of the eastern Pacific. High frequency reconstructions over brief
   time intervals from the 17th, 18th, and 20th century reveal that the
   seasonal onset of warm and cool phases near Galapagos has persisted for
   at least 340 years. A quantitative assessment of historical changes in
   upwelling intensity is complicated by offsets in background Mn levels
   recorded by different corals. One apparent longterm feature is an
   overall decline in skeletal Mn concentrations from 1600-1978 which
   results in a net decrease of 20-30%. Several possible explanations exist
   for this trend, ranging from accumulation of a persistent diagenetic Mn
   phase in fossil aragonite to a temporal shift in oceanic/atmospheric Mn
   fluxes reaching the surface waters of the Galapagos Islands.

AB The three tandemly arranged CBF genes, CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3, are
   involved in cold acclimation. Due to the lack of stable loss-of-function
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants deficient in all three CBF
   genes, it is still unclear whether the CBF genes are essential for
   freezing tolerance and whether they may have other functions besides
   cold acclimation. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to
   generate cbf single, double, and triple mutants. Compared to the wild
   type, the cbf triple mutants are extremely sensitive to freezing after
   cold acclimation, demonstrating that the three CBF genes are essential
   for cold acclimation. Our results show that the three CBF genes also
   contribute to basal freezing tolerance. Unexpectedly, we found that the
   cbf triple mutants are defective in seedling development and salt stress
   tolerance. Transcript profiling revealed that the CBF genes regulate 414
   cold-responsive (COR) genes, of which 346 are CBF-activated genes and 68
   are CBF-repressed genes. The analysis suggested that CBF proteins are
   extensively involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid
   metabolism, cell wall modification, and gene transcription.
   Interestingly, like the triple mutants, cbf2 cbf3 double mutants are
   more sensitive to freezing after cold acclimation compared to the wild
   type, but cbf1 cbf3 double mutants are more resistant, suggesting that
   CBF2 is more important than CBF1 and CBF3 in cold acclimation-dependent
   freezing tolerance. Our results not only demonstrate that the three CBF
   genes together are required for cold acclimation and freezing tolerance,
   but also reveal that they are important for salt tolerance and seedling
   development.

AB Sister (congeneric) species may exhibit disparate patterns of
   biogeographic genetic structures due to different life histories and
   habitat preferences. The common cockle Cerastoderma edule and the lagoon
   cockle Cerastoderrna glaucum probably diverged from their common
   ancestor in the present territory of Sahara around 5 million years ago.
   Although it is difficult to separate both species morphologically,
   various genetic markers, both mitochondrial and nuclear, clearly
   distinguish them. Furthermore, their lifestyles are different, as C.
   edule has a much less fragmented coastal habitat and a longer duration
   of pelagic larval stage than C. glaucum. A comparative genetic analysis
   was conducted on 17 populations of C. edule and 13 populations of C.
   glaucum using a 506 bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA (COI). We tested
   the hypothesis that differences in habitat types and life history are
   reflected in the genetic structure patterns of these two cockles. Indeed
   substantial differences in population genetic structures between them
   are revealed. Genetic diversity within C. glaucum populations decreases
   northwards as a consequence of post-glacial (re)colonization from
   southern refugia, while C. edule displays an opposite pattern indicating
   survival in glacial refuges in the northern Atlantic. Among populations
   within geographic groups, genetic differentiation is low in C. edule,
   probably as a result of larval dispersal with coastal currents, while it
   is extremely high in C. glaucum, best explained by the fragmented
   habitats. Interestingly, long distance divergence is less expressed in C
   glaucum than in C edule, which supports the speculation that migrating
   birds (frequently observed in lagoons) may occasionally transport the
   former more often or more efficiently than the latter. The approach
   applied in this study (e.g., rarefaction procedure, selection of samples
   of both species from the same regions) enabled a new and reliable
   comparative analysis of the existing raw datasets. (c) 2012 Elsevier

AB Porphyra yezoensis has a macroscopic foliage gametophyte phase with only
   a single cell layer, and is ideally suited for the study of the sexual
   differentiation process, from the vegetative cell to the spermatia.
   Firstly, we compared variations in the responses of the vegetative and
   male sectors to desiccation. Later, cell tracking experiments were
   carried out during the formation of spermatia from vegetative cells. The
   two sectors showed similar tolerance to desiccation, and the formation
   of spermatia from vegetative cells was independent of the degree of
   desiccation. Both light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   observations of the differentiation process showed that the formation of
   spermatia could be divided into six phases: the one-cell, two-cell,
   four-cell, eight-cell, pre-release and spermatia phases.
   Photomicrographs of Fluorescent Brightener staining showed that the
   released spermatia had no cell walls. Photosynthetic data showed that
   there was a significant rise in Y(II) in the four-cell phase, indicating
   an increase in photosynthetic efficiency of PSII during this phase. We
   propose that this photosynthetic rise may be substantial and provide the
   increased energy needed for the formation and release of spermatia in P.
   yezoensis.

AB We present a unifying model for isoprene emission by photosynthesizing
   leaves based on the hypothesis that isoprene biosynthesis depends on a
   balance between the supply of photosynthetic reducing power and the
   demands of carbon fixation.
   We compared the predictions from our model, as well as from two other
   widely used models, with measurements of isoprene emission from leaves
   of Populus nigra and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) in
   response to changes in leaf internal CO2 concentration (C-i) and
   photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) under diverse ambient CO2
   concentrations (C-a).
   Our model reproduces the observed changes in isoprene emissions with C-i
   and PPFD, and also reproduces the tendency for the fraction of fixed
   carbon allocated to isoprene to increase with increasing PPFD. It also
   provides a simple mechanism for the previously unexplained decrease in
   the quantum efficiency of isoprene emission with increasing C-a.
   Experimental and modelled results support our hypothesis. Our model can
   reproduce the key features of the observations and has the potential to
   improve process-based modelling of isoprene emissions by land vegetation
   at the ecosystem and global scales.

AB Picea purpurea (Purple cone spruce) is a dominant and widely distributed
   tree species in the subalpine area of the Wanglang Nature Reserve. We
   investigated variations in radial growth and its response to climate in
   P. purpurea along an altitudinal gradient. In this study, P. purpurea
   chronologies were developed from three altitudinal sites ranging from
   2850 to 3250 m above sea level. Correlation analysis and principal
   component analysis were used for all the chronologies to detect the
   growth patterns at different altitudes. Correlation analysis was used to
   assess the relationships between chronologies and climatic factors.
   Tree-ring widths among the three elevations were all positively
   correlated with June maximum temperature in the current year. Radial
   growth at the higher altitude was more sensitive to temperature than
   those of the two lower altitudes. Ring-widths at the low and middle
   sites were mainly negatively affected by temperatures in the previous
   growing season (June and August). Spruce growth at the upper site was
   strongly positively affected by temperatures in the previous winter, the
   current spring and current growing season. Climatological analysis
   revealed that elevation-dependent and elevation-independent signals were
   present in this semi-humid subalpine area. Precipitation was not the
   main factor affecting the tree growth in the growing season throughout
   the study area. The noteworthy findings were that the lag effects of
   temperatures to spruce growth was more significant at the low and middle
   altitude sites, and spruce growth at the high altitude site clearly
   benefited from the warmer climate before and during the growing season.
   This study will provide a basis for better predicting forest dynamics
   and carrying out vegetation restoration in the future.

AB Organisms have a limited number of responses that enhance survival in
   changing environments. They can: 1. Cope within existing physiological
   flexibility; 2. Adapt to changing conditions; or 3. Migrate to sites
   that allow survival. Species inhabiting coastal seabed sites around
   Antarctica have poorer physiological capacities to deal with change than
   species elsewhere. They die when temperatures are raised by only 5-10
   degrees C above the annual average, and many species lose the ability to
   perform essential functions, e.g. swimming in scallops or burying in
   infaunal bivalve molluscs when temperatures are raised only 2-3 degrees
   C. The ability to adapt, or evolve new characters to changing conditions
   depends, at least in part, on generation time. Antarctic benthic species
   grow slowly and develop at rates often x5-x10 slower than similar
   temperate species. They also live to great age, and exhibit deferred
   maturity. Longer generation times reduce the opportunities to produce
   novel mutations, and result in poorer capacities to adapt to change.
   Intrinsic capacities to colonize new sites and migrate away from
   deteriorating conditions depend on adult abilities to locomote over
   large distances, or for reproductive stages to drift for extended
   periods. The slow development of Antarctic benthic species means their
   larvae do spend extended periods in the water column. However, whereas
   most continents have coastlines extending over a wide range of latitude,
   Antarctica is almost circular in outline, is isolated from other oceans
   by the circumpolar current, and its coastline covers few degrees of
   latitude. Thus in a warming environment there are fewer places to
   migrate to. On all three major criteria Antarctic benthic species appear
   less capable than species elsewhere of responding to change in ways that
   can enhance survival.

AB As organisms age the environment fluctuates, exerting differential
   selection across ontogeny. In particular, highly seasonal environments
   expose life stages to often drastically different thermal environments.
   This developmental variation is particularly striking in organisms with
   complex life cycles, wherein life history stages also exhibit distinct
   morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors. Genes acting pleiotropically
   on thermal responses may produce genetic correlations across ontogeny,
   constraining the independent evolution of each life stage to their
   respective thermal environments. To investigate whether developmental
   genetic correlations constrain the evolution thermal hardiness of the
   fly Drosophila melanogaster, we applied quantitative genetic analyses to
   cold hardiness measured in both larvae and adults from isogenic lines of
   the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), using survival at
   stressful low temperatures as the phenotypic metric. Using full genome
   resequencing data for the DGRP, we also implemented genome-wide
   association (GWA) analysis using Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models
   (BSLMMs) to estimate associations between naturally segregating
   variation and cold hardiness for both larvae and adults. Quantitative
   genetic analyses revealed no significant genetic correlation for cold
   hardiness between life stages, suggesting complete genetic decoupling of
   thermal hardiness across the metamorphic boundary. Both quantitative
   genetic and GWA analyses suggested that polygenic variation underlies
   cold hardiness in both stages, and that associated loci largely affected
   one stage or the other, but not both. However, reciprocal enrichment
   tests and correlations between BSLMM parameters for each life stage
   support some shared physiological mechanisms that may reflect common
   cellular thermal response pathways. Overall, these results suggest no
   developmental genetic constraints on cold hardiness across metamorphosis
   in D. melanogaster, an important consideration in evolutionary models of
   responses to changing climates. Genetic correlations for environmental
   sensitivity across ontogeny remains largely unexplored in other
   organisms, thus assessing the generality of genetic decoupling will
   require further quantitative or population genetic analysis in
   additional species.

AB Bergmann's rule (BR) is a classical eco-geographic rule that relates
   body size of homoiothermal animals with environmental temperature (or
   latitude). Contemporary data indicate that latitudinal dines in body
   size, predicted by BR, also exist in ectothermic organisms and in some
   groups appear to be fairly common. Despite plenty of data from
   literature, it is still impossible to estimate the frequency of
   Bergmann's clines occurrence in ectotherms as thoroughly as it is done
   for homoiotherms. Within large taxa of ectotherms (Arthropoda, Mollusca,
   Pisces), Bergmann's clines occur alongside with anti-Bergmann's and
   U-shaped ones. Since classic explanation of BR, which is based on
   thermoregulation principles, is not applicable to most ectotherms, quite
   a few hypotheses have been proposed that appeal to other foundations in
   search of such an explanation. One part of them suggests a direct
   modifying influence of temperature, though most authors look for
   adaptive sense in increase of ectotherms size at high latitudes and/or
   low temperatures. It appears that a single universal explanation of all
   the cases of Bergmann's variability in ectotherms can not be formulated.
   Observed clines, as it seems, arise as a result of synergetic
   interactions between several factors that are covaried with latitude (or
   altitude above sea level). It is not always possible to estimate the
   exact contribution of each one of them.

AB In the marine realm, climate change can affect a variety of
   physico-chemical properties with wide-ranging biological effects, but
   the knowledge of how climate change affects benthic distributions is
   limited and mainly restricted to coastal environments. To project the
   response of benthic species of a shelf sea (North Sea) to the expected
   climate change, the distributions of 75 marine benthic species were
   modelled and the spatial changes in distribution were projected for 2099
   based on modelled bottom temperature and salinity changes using the IPCC
   scenario AIB. Mean bottom temperature was projected to increase between
   0.15 and 5.4 degrees C, while mean bottom salinity was projected to
   moderately increase by 1.7. The spatial changes in species distribution
   were modelled with Maxent and the direction and extent of these changes
   Were assessed. The results showed a latitudinal northward shift for 64%
   of the species (maximum 109 km; brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis) and a
   southward shift for 36% (maximum 101 km; hermit crab Pagurus prideaux
   and the associated cloak anemone Adamsia carciniopados; 105 km). The
   relatively low rates of distributional shifts compared to fish or
   plankton species were probably influenced by the regional topography.
   The environmental gradients in the central North Sea along the 50 m
   depth contour might act as a 'barrier', possibly resulting in a
   compression of distribution range and hampering further shifts to the
   north. For 49 species this resulted in a habitat loss up to 100%, while
   only 11 species could benefit from the warming in terms of habitat gain.
   Particularly the benthic communities of the southern North Sea, where
   the strongest temperature increase was projected, would be strongly
   affected by the distributional changes, since key species showed
   northward shifts and high rates of habitat loss, with potential
   ramifications for the functioning of the ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Dissecting the genomic regions governing abiotic stress tolerance is
   necessary for marker-assisted breeding to produce elite breeding lines.
   In this study, a world-wide collection of rapeseed was evaluated for
   salt tolerance. These rapeseed accessions showed a large variation for
   salt tolerance index ranging from 0.311 to 0.999. Although no
   significant correlation between salt tolerance and Na+ content was
   observed, there was a significant negative correlation between shoot
   biomass production under a control condition and salt tolerance. These
   rapeseed accessions were genotyped by DArTseq for a total of 51,109
   genetic markers, which were aligned with 'pseudomolecules'
   representative of the genome of rapeseed to locate their hypothetical
   order for association mapping. A total of 62 QTLs for salt tolerance,
   shoot biomass, and ion-homeostasis-related traits were identified by
   association mapping using both the P and Q+K models. Candidate genes
   located within the QTL regions were also shortlisted. Sequence analysis
   showed many polymorphisms for BnaaTSN1. Three of them in the coding
   region resulting in a premature stop codon or frameshift were found in
   most of the sensitive lines. Loss-of-function mutations showed a
   significant association with salt tolerance in B. napus.

AB While recent experimental work on a variety of reptile species has
   demonstrated that incubation temperature influences hatchling
   phenotypes; the biological significance of such phenotypic variation
   remains unclear. Incubation temperature may exert significant longterm
   phenotypic effects. Alternatively, such influences may be temporary, or
   negligible relative to effects induced by genetic factors, or by the
   environmental conditions experienced after hatching. Even if incubation
   temperature exerts long-term effects on phenotype, this might occur
   indirectly (by influencing hatching dates) rather than by direct
   modifications of developmental processes. We quantified the influences
   of the source population, incubation temperature and rearing
   environment, on the phenotype of the Australian garden skink
   (Lampropholis guichenoti) from populations that differ in nest
   temperature and phenotype. Interpopulation differences in the phenotypes
   of young lizards were found to be a product of all three Factors.
   However, the long-term effects of both population and incubation
   temperature operated indirectly (through variation in the date of
   hatching) rather than directly (through genetic or developmental
   factors). That is, once all temporal effects were removed, the only
   discernible influence on juvenile phenotypes was their rearing
   environment. Thus, some of the most important influences on lizard
   phenotypes may operate via modifications of hatching dale. (C) 2000 The

   number of finfish and invertebrates. The American lobster (Homarus
   americanus) supports Canada's most valuable fishery and exploitation
   rates are high. Female size-at-maturity (SM) is an important parameter
   in management of this species, as it is used in establishing minimum
   legal size regulations. In this study, we show with historical and
   recent data that SM of female American lobsters has declined across most
   of Canada, in some areas by as much as 30%, over the past 10-80 years.
   The spatial patterns of these declines are inconsistent with patterns of
   rising ocean temperature and lobster abundance (density). They are,
   however, strongly correlated to the strength of size-based fishery
   selection, and egg-per-recruit modeling indicates a gain in lifetime egg
   production associated with observed SM declines under a range of
   realistic harvesting scenarios. These findings suggest that the marked
   decrease we document in SM of female American lobsters in Canada over
   the past century represents an evolutionary response to intense
   exploitation.

   Newfoundland, Canada. We also summarized data detailing the seasonal
   stage succession of Calanus finmarchicus at that site, as well as along
   three oceanographic sections sampled in the spring, summer and autumn
   across the adjacent continental shelf. Simulations indicated that the
   Labrador and Newfoundland Shelves represent the major sources of
   particles transiting through the S27 site, with relatively minor
   contributions from the western Labrador Sea which are significant during
   a few months each year. The latter point may be affected by uncertainty
   in the representation of cross-shelf transport associated with seasonal
   or short-term variations in atmospheric and oceanic forcing, which may
   also affect the strength and location of bifurcation of the inner branch
   of the Labrador Current around the Grand Banks. Nevertheless, our
   results indicated that drift along the inner shelf is likely to be the
   primary source of copepods collected at S27 throughout most of the year.
   This in turn suggested that there may be a higher degree of connectivity
   between conditions in coastal areas of Newfoundland and those in Baffin

AB Measuring light, temperature, soil moisture, and growth provides a
   better understanding of net ecosystem production (NEP), ecosystem
   respiration (R (eco)), and their response functions. Here, we studied
   the variations in NEP and R (eco) in a grassland dominated by a
   perennial warm-season C-4 grass, Zoysia japonica. We used the chamber
   method to measure NEP and R (eco) from August to September 2007. Biomass
   and leaf area index (LAI) were also measured to observe their effects on
   NEP and R (eco). Diurnal variations in NEP and R (eco) were predicted
   well by light intensity (PPFD) and by soil temperature, respectively.
   Maximum NEP (NEPmax) values on days of year 221, 233, 247, and 262, were
   2.44, 2.55, 3.90, and 4.17 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Throughout
   the growing period, the apparent quantum yield (alpha) increased with
   increasing NEPmax that ranged from 0.0154 to 0.0515, and NEP responded
   to the soil temperature changes by 44% and R (eco) changes by 48%, and R
   (eco) responded from 88 to 94% with the soil temperature diurnally.
   NEP's light response and R (eco)'s temperature response were affected by
   soil water content; more than 27% of the variation in NEP and 67% of the
   variation in R (eco) could be explained by this parameter. NEP was
   strongly correlated with biomass and LAI, but R (eco) was not, because
   environmental variables affected R (eco) more strongly than growth
   parameters. Using the light response of NEP, the temperature response of
   R (eco), and meteorological data, daily NEP and R (eco) were estimated
   at 0.67, 0.81, 1.17, and 1.56 g C m(-2), and at 2.88, 2.50, 3.51, and
   3.04 g C m(-2), respectively, on days of year 221, 233, 247, and 262.
   The corresponding daily gross primary production (NEP + R (eco)) was
   3.5, 3.3, 4.6, and 4.6 g C m(-2).

AB There are concerns that increasing anthropogenic stressors can cause
   catastrophic transitions in ecosystems. Such shifts have large social,
   economic, and ecological consequences and therefore have important
   management implications. A potential mechanism behind these regime
   shifts is the Allee effect, which describes the decline in realized per
   capita growth rate at small population density. With an age-structured
   population model for Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, we illustrate how
   interactions between human-induced stressors, such as fishing and
   climate change, can worsen the impact of an Allee effect on populations
   by promoting hysteresis. Therefore, the risk of population collapse and
   recovery failure is exacerbated and the success of preventing and
   reverting collapse depends on the climate regime. We find that, in
   presence of the Allee effect, a fishing moratorium is only sufficient
   for recovery when sea surface temperature rise remains within 2 degrees
   C and fishing is restricted within 10 yrs. If sea surface temperature
   rises beyond 2 degrees C, even immediate banning of fishing is not
   sufficient to guarantee recovery. If fishing is not fully banned and a
   residual fishing pressure remains, the probability of recovery is
   further decreased, also in the absence of an Allee effect. The results
   underscore the decisive role of Allee effects for the management of
   depleted populations in an increasingly human-dominated world. Once the
   population collapses and its growth rate is suppressed, rebuilding
   measures will be squandered and collapse will very likely be
   irreversible. We therefore emphasize the need for proactive management
   involving precautionary, adaptive measures and reference points. Our
   studies shows that climate change has the potential to strengthen Allee
   effects, which could increasingly challenge fisheries management.

AB Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of temperature in
   the population dynamics and distribution of Pacific sardine (Sardinops
   sagax caeruleus), few studies have examined the species' physiological
   response to temperature under controlled conditions. The effect of
   fluctuating thermal regimes on blood plasma cortisol, glucose, aspartate
   aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (AST) and red blood
   cell (RBC) counts of Pacific sardine was evaluated to monitor
   physiological response. Sardines from the southern subpopulation that
   inhabits waters off Baja California, Mexico, were collected during fall
   2008. Acclimation to four fluctuating temperature regimes (two symmetric
   and two asymmetric) and a constant, optimal temperature occurred over 20
   d. Symmetric and asymmetric regimes were designed to simulate regional
   summer (18-23 degrees C) and winter (13-18 degrees C) temperature ranges
   within 24 h. In the optimal regime (OR), sardines were acclimated to 18
   degrees C. In symmetric regimes, sardines were exposed for 7 h to the
   high and low temperatures, while in asymmetric regimes exposure to the
   high temperature was shorter (4 vs. 10 h). Blood sampling took place
   during the low and high temperature exposure, and we tested for
   differences in blood parameters compared to OR. Plasma cortisol and
   glucose concentration of sardines from summer regimes were only
   significantly higher at 23 degrees C. AST activities were significantly
   higher than OR during the high and low temperatures of both summer
   treatments. No differences were found in individuals exposed to the
   winter regimes. ALT activities were significantly higher than OR only
   during the high and low temperature of the symmetric summer regime. RBC
   were significantly higher than OR for both summer regimes. Sardines from
   southern subpopulation exhibit a negative physiological response to high
   temperatures, yet they can acclimate to the lower (<= 18 degrees C)
   temperatures typical of the California Current System. Temperatures >=
   23 degrees C may be considered a detrimental sublethal temperature,
   particularly for long exposure periods.

   among different sheep breeds. Ninety female sheep, eighteen of each
   breed: Santa Ines and Morada Nova (Brazilian hair breeds), Texel,
   Suffolk and Ile de France (wool breeds) were challenged during three
   non-consecutive summer days (22 degrees 42'S, 47 degrees 18'W, and 570m
   of altitude, maximum air temperature of 33.5 degrees C, average relative
   humidity of 52 +/- 6.9%). The physiological variables were registered at
   0800 h (T1), 1300 h (T2: after 2 h of shade rest), 1400 h (T3) (after
   one hour of sun exposure) and in the shade at 1415 h (T4), 1430 h (T5),
   1445 h (T6) and 1500 h (T7) and a thermotolerance index (TCI) was
   calculated as (10-(T7 to T4)-T1). The statistical analysis was performed
   by a mathematical model including the fixed effects of breeds and time
   frames, and the interaction between these effects, besides random
   effects such as animal and day. The Santa Ines breed presented the
   lowest RT after sun exposure (39.3 +/- 0.12 degrees C; P < 0.05) and it
   was the only one to recover morning RT 60 min after heat stress (38.7
   and 38.9 for 1300 h and 1500 h; P > 0.05). Hair breeds presented RR
   lower (P < 0.05) than wool breeds. Although thick wool or hair thickness
   differs among and within hair and wool breeds (P < 0.05), SR did not
   differ among breeds and time (227.7 +/- 16.44 g m(-2) h(-1); P > 0.05).
   The thermotolerance index did not differ among breeds, but it showed
   similar response (P > 0.05) 45 min or 1 h of shade after sun exposure.
   One week post shearing is not enough to wool breeds present to show

AB Several molecular evidences have been gathered in Poaceae that point out
   a central role of the CBF/DREB1 transcription factors in the signal
   transduction pathways leading to low-temperature tolerance, although to
   a quite different extent between crops originating from either temperate
   or tropical climates. A common feature of the CBF/DREB1 genes in Poaceae
   is their structural organization at the genome level in clusters of
   tandemly duplicated genes. In temperate cereals such as barley and
   wheat, expansion of specific multigene phylogenetic clades of CBFs that
   map at the Frost Resistance-2 locus has been exclusively observed. In
   addition, copy number variants of CBF genes between frost resistant and
   frost sensitive genotypes raise the question if multiple copies of the
   CBF/DREB1s are required to ensure freezing tolerance. On the other hand,
   in crops of tropical origin such as rice and maize, a smaller or
   less-responsive CBF regulon may have evolved, and different mechanisms
   might determine chilling tolerance. In this review, recent advances on
   the organization and diversity at the CBF cluster locus in the grasses
   are provided and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Recent work on selected topics of particular interest for understanding
   insect life-cycles is reviewed, including habitat patterns, kinds of
   variation, the spreading of risk and prolonged diapause, trade-offs and
   developmental plasticity, circannual rhythms, the concept of life cycles
   as developmental choices, and development or delay as the default
   response. Seasonal adaptations have a wider range of components than has
   often been appreciated. Variation in life-cycle traits, including the
   duration of development and the timing of emergence, can be wide,
   narrow, or discontinuous. Trade-offs encompass multiple simultaneous
   traits and are not always structured as might be expected. Diapause,
   cold hardiness, reproductive pattern, and other traits have evolved many
   times independently. Such complex interactions can be understood only by
   examining the detailed features of a species' habitat, because how
   developmental decisions are made and whether continuous development or
   delays are programmed reflect the predictability of habitats and the
   environmental signals they supply. Ecological context is important, not
   just mechanisms of adaptation. Therefore, although most previous studies
   have paid more attention to insect response than to habitat,
   interpreting the seasonal relevance of life-cycle patterns requires
   measurement and analysis for individual species of habitat
   characteristics and their variation, on a range of temporal and spatial
   scales, in much more detail than has been customary.

AB Increasing water temperatures owing to anthropogenic climate change are
   predicted to negatively impact the aerobic metabolic performance of
   aquatic ectotherms. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that thermal
   increases result in reductions in aerobic scope (AS), which lead to
   decreases in energy available for essential fitness and performance
   functions. Consequences of warming are anticipated to be especially
   severe for warm-adapted tropical species as they are thought to have
   narrow thermal windows and limited plasticity for coping with elevated
   temperatures. In this study we test how predicted warming may affect the
   aerobic performance of Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a commercially
   harvested fish species in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. We
   measured critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and key metabolic variables
   such as AS and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) across a
   range of temperatures, and compared responses between acute (3-day)
   exposures and 3-week acclimations. CTmax increased with acclimation
   temperature; however, 3-week-acclimated fish had higher overall CTmax
   than acutely exposed individuals. Nile perch also showed the capacity to
   increase or maintain high AS even at temperatures well beyond their
   current range; however, acclimated Nile perch had lower AS compared with
   acutely exposed fish. These changes were accompanied by lower EPOC,
   suggesting that drops in AS may reflect improved energy utilization
   after acclimation, a finding that is supported by improvements in growth
   at high temperatures over the acclimation period. Overall, the results
   challenge predictions that tropical species have limited thermal
   plasticity, and that high temperatures will be detrimental because of
   limitations in AS.

AB The major restriction to expansion of scallop culture and scallop
   fishery enhancement in Europe is a reliable source of scallop spat. In
   Ireland, production of spat from the natural settlement in Mulroy Bay
   has exhibited considerable variation over the last 25 years. In this
   study data available on king scallop spawnings have been reviewed with
   the objective of understanding why in some years spat are abundant and
   in others scarce. Similar spawning periods of king scallops, Pecten
   maximus in two locations 10 km apart, supported the use of scallops from
   the Broad Water for gonad monitoring rather than from the North Water
   spat production site where scallop dredging is legally prohibited. Using
   weekly determination of gonad index, gonad weight and relative gonad
   height, five partial spawnings were recorded between April to August in
   1 year, with scallops capable of spawning 1 week and re-maturing to a
   pre-spawning level the following week. Sampling frequency significantly
   influenced the number and size of spawnings recorded, (late of the
   spawning and duration of the spawning event. These results have major
   implications for data collected using sampling intervals greater than 1
   week and purporting to represent the reproductive cycle of this scallop.
   Based on weekly monitoring of scallop gonads during summer months
   between 1993 to 2004 there was no significant correlation between
   intensity of the scallop spatfall and size of the gonad prior to
   spawning, magnitude of spawning event, date of spawning period within
   June and July and duration of the spawning event.

   have identified C-repeat/DREB binding factors (CBFs) as key
   transcription factors that function in cold acclimation. Recent studies
   revealed the involvement of pivotal protein kinases and transcription

AB Newly emerged adult dragonflies are physiologically immature in a number

   flight muscles. In Libelling pulchella dragonflies, adult maturation of
   flight muscle is accompanied by striking changes in thermal physiology.
   Vertical force production during fixed flight attempts in newly emerged
   adults (tenerals) shows a broad plateau of near-peak performance, first
   attained at cool thoracic temperatures (typically 28-34 degrees C) and
   maintained up to thoracic temperatures of 40-45 degrees C [mean optimal
   thoracic temperature (OTT)=34.6 degrees C; mean upper lethal temperature
   (ULT)=45.3 degrees C]. In contrast, fully mature adults show narrow
   thermal sensitivity curves, wherein peak performance is approached only
   within a few degrees of the thermal optimum, which invariably occurs at
   hot thoracic temperatures (38-50 degrees C; mean OTT=43.5 degrees C;
   mean ULT=48.6 degrees C). These changes in the shape and position of
   thermal performance curves are compared with predictions from hypotheses

AB We describe an association mapping approach using natural populations of
   perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) to identify molecular markers
   associated with heading date, an important trait affecting seasonal
   production, tillering, digestibility and grassland management regimes.
   Twenty-three natural populations originating from throughout Europe,
   with heading date phenotypes ranging from very early to very late, as
   well as three synthetic populations (varieties) were used for molecular
   marker genotyping using AFLP. In total, 589 polymorphic markers were
   identified. Hierarchical clustering, principal coordinate and other
   statistical analyses identified four outlying populations forming a
   clearly distinct sub-group. Removal of those four populations from the
   subsequent analysis reduced population sub-structure twofold. However,
   this made relatively little difference to the result of the association
   analysis. Linear regression identified three markers whose frequency of
   occurrence correlated with the heading date phenotype. Moreover, these
   markers were shown to be closely linked to each other within a major QTL
   on Chromosome 7, explaining 70% of the total variation in heading date.
   Pairwise linkage disequilibrium among them was also significant. These
   results suggest that association mapping approaches may be feasible in
   L. perenne, and that the use of natural populations could provide a
   useful source of genetic variation in traits of importance in crop
   improvement.

AB The dairy industry produces large quantities of whey as a by-product of
   cheese production and is increasingly looking for new ways to utilize
   this waste product. Gellan gum is reliably produced by Sphingomonas
   paucimobilis in growth media containing lactose, a significant component
   of cheese,whey, as a carbon source. We studied and compared
   polysaccharide biosynthesis by S. paucimobilis ATCC 31461 in media
   containing glucose, lactose (5 to 30 g/liter), and sweet cheese whey. We
   found that altering the growth medium can markedly affect the
   polysaccharide yield, acyl substitution level, polymer rheological
   properties, and susceptibility to degradation. Depression of gellan
   production from lactose compared with gellan production from glucose
   (approximately 30%) did not appear to occur at the level of synthesis of
   sugar nucleotides, which are the donors of monomers used for
   biosynthesis of the repetitive tetrasaccharide unit of gellan. The
   lactose-derived biopolymer had the highest total acyl content; the
   glucose- and whey-derived gellans had similar total acyl contents but
   differed markedly in their acetate and glycerate levels. Rheological
   studies revealed how the functionality of a gellan polysaccharide is
   affected by changes in the acyl substitution.

AB Senescence may evolve when genes have antagonistic effects between early
   reproduction and later age-specific mortality. Although widely
   consistent with data of quantitative genetics, this model has yet to be
   validated with the identification of a specific locus presenting such
   trade-offs. The molecular chaperone hsp70 may be a candidate for such a
   gene. Heat induced expression of the Hsp70 protein in adults decreases
   rates of age-specific mortality during normal aging, while maternally
   experienced heat shock depresses the production of mature progeny. Here
   we show that maternal heat shock reduces the proportion of egg hatch but
   not the viability of successfully hatched offspring. To assess whether
   heat induced maternal expression of hsp70 causes reduced egg hatch, we
   measured the proportion of eggs that hatch from females engineered to
   overexpress hsp70 transgenes. We used the same transgenic strains that
   extend longevity upon hsp70 expression and found that Hsp70 is
   sufficient to suppress egg hatch. The proportion of egg hatch as a
   function of hsp70 expression was not reduced in the first eggs laid
   after maternal heat shock, but appears in later laid eggs, which were at
   preoogenic and early vitellogenic stages during the maternal expression
   of hsp70. The contervailing effects of hsp70 upon fecundity and
   subsequent age-specific mortality exemplify antagonistic pleiotropy, and
   this trade-off could contribute to the evolution of Drosophila
   senescence.

   be a candidate. Carbon concentrating mechanisms, e.g., in higher plants
   C-4 -photosynthesis and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), generate
   high internal CO2 concentrations, important for photosynthesis, but also
   as a basis for signalling via diffusion Of CO2. Spatiotemporal dynamics
   of desynchronization/synchronization of photosynthetic activity over
   leaves can be followed by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. One example
   of desynchronization is based on patchiness of stomatal opening/closing
   in heterobaric leaves due to anatomic constraints of lateral CO2
   diffusion. During CAM, largely different internal CO2 concentrations
   prevail in the leaves, offering opportunities to study the effect of

AB Demonstrating the likelihood of evolution in response to global warming
   is important, yet challenging. We discuss how three spatial thermal
   gradients (latitudinal, altitudinal, and urbanization) can be used as
   natural laboratories to inform about the gradual thermal evolution of
   populations by applying a space-for-time substitution (SFTS) approach.
   We compare thermal variables and confounding non-thermal abiotic
   variables, methodological approaches and evolutionary aspects associated
   with each type of gradient. On the basis of an overview of recent insect
   studies, we show that a key assumption of SFTS, local thermal adaptation
   along these gradients, is often but not always met, requiring explicit
   validation. To increase realism when applying SFTS, we highlight the
   importance of integrating daily temperature fluctuations, multiple
   stressors and multiple interacting species. Finally, comparative
   studies, especially across gradient types, are important to provide more
   robust inferences of evolution under gradual global warming. Integrating
   these research directions will further strengthen the still underused,
   yet powerful SFTS approach to infer gradual evolution under global
   warming.

AB 1. The importance of native freshwater mussels for ecosystem processes
   depends on their density, size distribution and activity. In lakes, many
   of the factors that affect mussels (fish hosts, habitat, food) could be
   directly or indirectly related to wind-driven physical processes. 2. We
   tested whether the abundance and size of Elliptio complanata in the
   shallow, nearshore areas of a medium-sized lake were related to site
   exposure, substratum type and fish distribution. To disentangle some of
   the correlated variables known to affect mussel distribution, we used
   paired exposed and sheltered sampling sites along the 7-km fetch of the
   lake basin. 3. The distribution of sediment characteristics in nearshore
   areas was highly predictable. The mean depth of accumulated soft
   sediments decreased with increasing fetch at wind-exposed sites, but
   increased with increasing fetch at sheltered sites. Sediments were
   deeper along the main shoreline than around islands. Deeper sediments
   tended to be finer and higher in silt content and organic fraction. 4.
   The density and proportion of juvenile mussels along the main shoreline
   varied in a unimodal way with sediment depth. These results suggest that
   wind-driven physical forces affect the transport of young juveniles to
   sediment depositional areas and create sediment conditions that
   influence their growth and survival. In contrast, the proportion of
   juvenile mussels around islands was not related to sediment
   characteristics, but decreased with remoteness of the island, suggesting
   that the distribution of juvenile mussels may be limited by fish
   movements. These results are tentative since they do not include buried
   juvenile mussels. 5. We also found a unimodal relationship between total
   mussel density (juveniles and adults) and sediment depth but, in
   contrast to the relationship for juveniles only, it applied to all sites
   with soft sediments, including islands. We conclude that factors related
   to sediment depth affect the growth and survival of adult mussels around
   islands and that these factors are strong enough to modify the pattern
   of distribution established via dispersal during earlier life stages. 6.
   The mean shell length of adults at different sites within the lake basin
   ranged from 60 to 85 mm. Mussel shell length decreased with increasing
   fetch at sites exposed to the prevalent winds, but was relatively
   constant on the sheltered side of peninsulas and islands. The size of
   unionid mussels in different parts of the lake seems to be determined
   both by their exposure to physical forces and by sediments. 7. The local
   distribution of E. complanata is determined, directly and indirectly, by
   wind-driven forces. These processes are likely to be important for other
   benthic organisms affected by similar habitat conditions (e.g. sediment
   characteristics, physical disturbance).

AB Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a key component of drought
   and has a strong influence on yields. Whole-plant transpiration rate
   (TR) response to increasing VPD has been linked to drought tolerance in
   wheat, but because of its challenging phenotyping, its genetic basis
   remains unexplored. Further, the genetic control of other key traits
   linked to daytime TR such as leaf area, stomata densities and - more
   recently - nocturnal transpiration remains unknown. Considering the
   presence of wheat phenology genes that can interfere with drought
   tolerance, the aim of this investigation was to identify at an enhanced
   resolution the genetic basis of the above traits while investigating the
   effects of phenology genes Ppd-D1 and Ppd-B1. Virtually all traits were
   highly heritable (heritabilities from 0.61 to 0.91) and a total of
   mostly trait-specific 68 QTL were detected. Six QTL were identified for
   TR response to VPD, with one QTL (QSLP.ucl-5A) individually explaining
   25.4% of the genetic variance. This QTL harbored several genes
   previously reported to be involved in ABA signaling, interaction with
   DREB2A and root hydraulics. Surprisingly, nocturnal TR and stomata
   densities on both leaf sides were characterized by highly specific and
   robust QTL. In addition, negative correlations were found between TR and
   leaf area suggesting trade-offs between these traits. Further, Ppd-D1
   had strong but opposite effects on these traits, suggesting an
   involvement in this trade-off. Overall, these findings revealed novel
   genetic resources while suggesting a more direct role of phenology genes
   in enhancing wheat drought tolerance.

   degrees C. These population and temperature effects act to reinforce one
   another and it could therefore be predicted that the growth differences

AB Intraspecific variation in animal energy and water balances may play an
   important role in local adaptation of populations to specific habitats
   such as deserts. We examined Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), a
   common bat in Israel that ranges in distribution from mesic
   Mediterranean to hyperarid desert habitats, for intraspecific
   differences in metabolic rate (MR) and evaporative water loss (EWL)
   among populations along a climatic gradient. We tested the prediction
   that EWL, especially at high ambient temperatures is lower in Kuhl's
   pipistrelles from desert habitats than from mesic habitats. We measured
   MR and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) at four ambient temperatures
   (10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C) in three
   groups of bats using open-flow respirometry. We fitted the bats with a
   mask to separate cutaneous water loss (CWL) from respiratory water loss
   (RWL) at 35 degrees C. At 35 degrees C, mean TEWL in the southernmost
   group, from the hyperarid location, was significantly lower than in the
   other two groups, with no apparent difference in mean MR. The source of
   difference TEWL was that the southern group had significantly lower CWL
   than the other two groups; RWL did not differ among them. This suggests
   that there are mechanisms that reduce EWL from the skin of the bats; a
   likely candidate is modification of the lipids in the outer layer of the
   dermis that make the skin possibly less permeable to water as has been
   described in birds and a few other species of bat.

AB The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was introduced into Strangford
   Lough, Northern Ireland in the 1970s. It was assumed that local
   environmental conditions would not facilitate successful reproduction.
   However, in the 1990s there were reports of C. gigas outside licensed
   aquaculture sites and this investigation set out to ascertain the
   current distribution, years of likely recruitment and population
   structure of the species. C. gigas were found distributed widely
   throughout the northern basin during surveys; the frequency distribution
   suggesting C gigas is not recruiting every year. Establishment of feral
   populations of C. gigas elsewhere have linked to habitat change. A pilot
   cull was initiated to assess the success rate of early intervention.
   This paper demonstrates the potential benefits of responding rapidly to
   initial reports of non-native species in a way that may curtail
   establishment and expansion. The method advocated in simple and can be
   recommended to the appropriate regulatory authorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Snow cover occupies large percentage of land surface in Tibetan Plateau.
   Snow cover duration (SCD) during non-growing seasons plays a critical
   role in regulating alpine vegetations phenology by affecting the energy
   budgets of land surface and soil moisture conditions. Different periods
   snow cover during non-growing season may have distinct effect on the
   vegetations phenology. Start of season (SOS) has been observed advanced
   under the ongoing climate change in the plateau, but it still remains
   unclear how the SCD alters the SOS. This study attempts to answer the
   following questions: (i) What is the pattern of spatial and temporal
   variations for SCD and grassland SOS? (ii) Which periods SCD plays a
   critical role in grasslands SOS?
   The remote sensing datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were utilized to compute the SOS and SCD on
   the Tibetan Plateau over 200315. The Asymmetric Gaussian function was
   applied to extract SOS. We also explored the spatial pattern and
   temporal variation of SOS and SCD. Then, by using linear correlation
   coefficients, we investigated the driving effects of different periods
   non-growing season SCD on SOS.
   The non-growing season SCD slightly decreased during 200315, while SOS
   exhibited an overall advancing trend. Advanced trends in SOS were
   observed in the eastern plateau, and the delayed trends were mainly
   founded in western plateau. Snow cover area exhibited two separate peaks
   during autumn and late winter over the plateau. Extended SCD regions
   mainly distributed in middle-east of the plateau, while shrunken SCD
   distributed in other regions of the plateau. SCD of different seasons
   caused distinct effects on vegetation SOS. Lengthened autumn SCD
   advanced SOS over the eastern plateau. The slightly lengthened SCD
   postponed SOS over the western plateau. In the wet meadow regions,
   advanced SOS was positively associated with SCD during the entire
   non-growing season, whereas for the dry steppe, SCD over the preseason
   played a more dominant role. The SCD of previous autumn and winter also
   showed lag effect on SOS over meadow regions to a certain extent. This
   study confirmed the importance of SCD to phenological processes at the
   beginning of growing season and further suggested that role of SCD
   should be discriminated for different periods and for different
   heat-water conditions. With the lag effects and SCDs distinct effect of
   different seasons considered, predictions on the Tibetan Plateaus spring
   phenology could be improved.

AB Many simple (univariate, bivariate) and complex (multivariate)
   statistical techniques are used to investigate trends in biological
   communities and to test hypotheses about potential relationships between
   ecosystem components. However, the simple methods that are commonly used
   (regression and correlation) are prone to Type I error (rejecting a true
   null hypothesis) when applied repeatedly. Although multivariate methods
   are preferable for community analysis, their computations are
   mathematically demanding and the interpretation of their outputs can be
   challenging. We present simple community analysis (SCA), an intuitive
   methodology with which to test for trend and correlation at the
   community-level. We demonstrate SCA using fish survey and phytoplankton
   count data: the non-parametric test statistic, Kendall's tau, is used to
   determine the strength of trends in abundance in 65 species of fish
   sampled during the Irish groundfish survey (maximal length of sampling
   periods were 1999-2007 in ICES division VIIg and 2002-2007 in divisions
   VIa. VIIb and VIIj, however catches of numerous species were not
   recorded prior to 2003) and in 77 genera of phytoplankton sampled at
   Irish aquaculture sites (1991-2002). The sample distribution of the test
   statistic (tau is used here, but other measures may be used) is compared
   to the expected distribution using distributional tests
   (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to evaluate the significance of community-level
   trends. The phytoplankton community has been increasing in abundance on
   Irish western and southwestern coasts (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test D > 0.5,
   p < 0.001). Similarly, and in agreement with previously published
   long-term studies. Lusitanian fish have been increasing on the shelf to
   the north and west of Ireland (D >= 0.35, p < 0.001), while the boreal
   community has been declining to the south (southeast, D = 0.47, p <
   0.001; southwest, D = 0.32, p = 0.03). Although SCA cannot identify
   causality, the trends in fish communities are as expected given the
   combined impacts of climate change and fishing: thus, we suggest that
   these are currently the main drivers of change and the precise
   mechanisms at play merit further study with long-term data. Biological
   processes at aquaculture sites should be investigated further as
   possible mechanisms explaining both the observed positive trends in the
   phytoplankton community and the restriction of negative trends to
   Heterosigma and eight dinoflagellate genera. Applied in conjunction with
   other statistical tools, SCA should aid researchers who aim to describe
   change in communities and community-level relationships with covariates.
   SCA is a powerful tool for hypothesis testing at the community-level,
   which simultaneously produces information at the community member level
   for more detailed insight, while providing simple summary statistics for
   managers and policy makers. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

AB Phenotypic plasticity has been proposed as a mechanism that facilitates
   the success of biological invasions. In order to test the hypothesis of
   an adaptive role for plasticity in invasions, particular attention
   should be paid to the relationship between the focal plastic trait, the
   environmental stimulus and the functional importance of the trait. The
   Drosophila wing is particularly amenable to experimental studies of
   phenotypic plasticity. Wing morphology is known for its plastic
   variation under different experimental temperatures, but this plasticity
   has rarely been investigated in a functional context of flight. Here, we
   investigate the effect of temperature on wing morphology and flight in
   the invasive pest species Drosophila suzukii. Although the rapid
   invasion of both Europe and North America was most likely facilitated by
   human activities, D. suzukii is also expected to disperse actively. By
   quantifying wing morphology and individual flight trajectories of flies
   raised under different temperatures, we tested whether (1) invasive
   populations of D. suzukii show higher phenotypic plasticity than their
   native counterparts, and (2) wing plasticity affects flight parameters.
   Developmental temperature was found to affect both wing morphology and
   flight parameters (in particular speed and acceleration), leaving open
   the possibility of an adaptive value for wing plasticity. Our results
   show no difference in phenotypic plasticity between invasive and native
   populations, rejecting a role for wing plasticity in the invasion
   success.

AB 1. Changes in seasonality associated with climate warming (e.g.
   temperature, growing season duration) are likely to alter invertebrate
   prey biomass and availability in aquatic ecosystems through direct and
   indirect influences on physiology and phenology, particularly in arctic
   lakes. However, despite warmer thermal regimes, photoperiod will remain
   unchanged such that potential shifts resulting from longer and warmer
   growing seasons could be limited by availability of sunlight, especially
   at lower trophic levels. Thus, a better understanding of warming effects
   on invertebrate prey throughout the growing season (e.g. early, peak,
   late) is important to understand arctic lake food-web dynamics in a
   changing climate.
   2. Here, we use a multifaceted approach to evaluate prey availability to
   predators in lakes of arctic Alaska. In a laboratory mesocosm
   experiment, we measured different metrics of abundance for snails
   (Lymnaea elodes) and zooplankton (Daphnia middendorffiana) across three
   time periods (early, mid- and late growing season) and across three
   temperature and photoperiod treatments (control, increased temperature
   and increased temperature x photoperiod). Additionally, we used
   generalised additive models and generalised additive mixed-effects
   models to relate long-term empirical observations of zooplankton biomass
   (1983-2015) to observed temperature regimes in an arctic lake. We then
   simulated zooplankton biomass for the warmest temperature observations
   across the growing season to inform likely zooplankton biomass regimes
   under future change.
   3. We observed variable responses by snails and zooplankton across
   experiments and treatments. Early in the growing season, snail
   development was accelerated at multiple life stages (e.g. egg and
   juvenile). In mid-season, in accordance with warmer temperatures, we
   observed significantly increased Daphnia abundances. However, in the
   late season, Daphnia appeared to be limited by photoperiod. Confirming
   our experimental results, our models of zooplankton biomass showed an
   increase of nearly 20% in warmer years. Further, these model estimates
   could be conservative as the consumptive demand of fishes may increase
   in warmer years as well.
   4. Overall, our results highlight the importance of interactive effects
   of temperature and seasonality. Based primarily on temperature, we can
   readily predict the response of fish metabolism in warmer temperatures.
   However, in this context, we generally require a better understanding of
   climate-driven responses of important invertebrate prey resources. Our
   results suggest invertebrate prey biomass and availability are likely to
   respond positively with climate change based on temperature and
   seasonality, as well as proportionally to the metabolic requirements of
   fish predators. While further research is necessary to understand how
   other food-web components will respond climate change, our findings
   suggest that the fish community at the top of arctic lake food webs will
   have adequate prey base in a warming climate.

AB Many cells cover themselves with a multifunctional polymer coat, the
   pericellular matrix (PCM), to mediate mechanical interactions with the
   environment. A particular PCM, the endothelial glycocalyx (EG), is
   formed by vascular endothelial cells at their luminal side, forming a
   mechanical interface between the flowing blood and the endothelial cell
   layer. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) hyaluronan (HA) is involved in the
   main functions of the EG, mechanotransduction of fluid shear stress and
   molecular sieving. HA, due to its length, is the only GAG in the EG or
   any other PCM able to form an entangled network. The mechanical
   functions of the EG are, however, impaired when any one of its
   components is removed. We here used microrheology to measure the effect
   of the EG constituents heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, whole blood
   plasma and albumin on the high-bandwidth mechanical properties of a HA
   solution. Furthermore, we probed the effect of the hyaldherin aggrecan,
   a constituent of the PCM of chondrocytes, and very similar to versican
   (present in the PCM of various cells, and possibly in the EG). We show
   that components directly interacting with HA (chondroitin sulfate and
   aggrecan) can increase the viscoelastic shear modulus of the polymer
   composite.

AB Species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with spatial and
   temporal temperature variability. Species with broad geographical
   distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a
   broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of
   locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in
   thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and
   Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature
   varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration
   rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average
   temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance
   curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not
   lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the
   average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal
   coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore,
   symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the
   average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting
   that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral
   host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

   biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses

AB The life-history strategies of some species make them strong candidates
   for rapid exploitation of novel habitat under new climate regimes. Some
   early-responding species may be considered invasive, and negatively
   impact on 'naive' ecosystems. The barrens-forming sea urchin
   Centrostephanus rodgersii is one such species, having a high dispersal
   capability and a high-latitude range margin limited only by a
   developmental temperature threshold. Within this species' range in
   eastern Australian waters, sea temperatures have increased at greater
   than double the global average rate. The coinciding poleward range
   extension of C. rodgersii has caused major ecological changes,
   threatening reef biodiversity and fisheries productivity. We
   investigated microsatellite diversity and population structure
   associated with range expansion by this species. Generalized linear
   model analyses revealed no reduction in genetic diversity in the newly
   colonized region. A 'seascape genetics' analysis of genetic distances
   found no spatial genetic structure associated with the range extension.
   The distinctive genetic characteristic of the extension zone populations
   was reduced population-specific F-ST, consistent with very rapid
   population expansion. Demographic and genetic simulations support our
   inference of high connectivity between pre- and post-extension zones.
   Thus, the range shift appears to be a poleward extension of the
   highly-connected rangewide population of C. rodgersii. This is
   consistent with advection of larvae by the intensified warm water East
   Australian current, which has also increased Tasmanian Sea temperatures
   above the species' lower developmental threshold. Thus, ocean
   circulation changes have improved the climatic suitability of novel
   habitat for C. rodgersii and provided the supply of recruits necessary
   for colonization.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to quantify the
   relationships between species distribution and environmental variables.
   The predictive skill of SDMs depends on whether appropriate explanatory
   variables and intrinsic processes are included in the model. In addition
   to abiotic environmental variables, biotic variables could also have
   significant impacts on the spatial distribution of marine organisms.
   Correlations between some explanatory variables will cause
   multicollinearity, which could result in overfitting of models and
   erroneous projections/forecasts of species distribution. Application of
   dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis
   (PCA) could be used to retain important information and avoid
   collinearity. We compared the performance of the generalized additive
   model (GAM) and the PCA-based GAM in predicting the spatial distribution
   of Hexagrammos otakii in Haizhou Bay, incorporating abiotic and biotic
   variables in these models. Results showed that the PCA-based GAM was
   able to reduce the multicollinearity introduced by explanatory variables
   and improve the performance of GAMs, according to a cross-validation
   test and predicted species distribution. Incorporating prey abundance in
   PCA-based GAM could improve the predictive skill of SDMs. The method
   proposed in this study could be extended to other marine organisms to
   enhance our understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying the
   distribution of target species.

AB Marine fisheries management strives to maintain sustainable populations
   while allowing exploitation. However, well-intentioned management plans
   may not meet this balance as most do not include the effect of climate
   change. Ocean temperatures are expected to increase through the 21st
   century, which will have far-reaching and complex impacts on marine
   fisheries. To begin to quantify these impacts for one coastal fishery
   along the cast coast of the United States, we develop a coupled climate
   population model for Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The
   model is based on a mechanistic hypothesis: recruitment is determined by
   temperature-driven, overwinter mortality of juveniles in their estuarine
   habitats. Temperature forecasts were obtained from 14 general
   circulation models simulating three CO2 emission scenarios. An
   ensemble-based approach was used in which a multimodel average was
   calculated for a given CO2 emission scenario to forecast the response of
   the population. The coupled model indicates that both exploitation and
   climate change significantly affect abundance and distribution of
   Atlantic croaker. At current levels of fishing, the average (2010-2100)
   spawning biomass of the population is forecast to increase by 60-100%.
   Similarly, the center of the population is forecast to shift 50-100 km
   northward. A yield analysis, which is used to calculate benchmarks for
   fishery management, indicates that the maximum sustainable yield will
   increase by 30-100%. Our results demonstrate that climate effects on
   fisheries must be identified, understood, and incorporated into the
   scientific advice provided to managers if sustainable exploitation is to
   be achieved in a changing climate.

AB The Subtropical Front (STF) is one of the major ocean fronts in the
   south-west Pacific. The STF migration has a distinct but varying impact
   on the temperature change throughout the region. To improve our
   understanding on the history of the STF migration and the relationship
   between STF migration and global climate change, we have generated a
   450-kyr record of sea surface temperature (SST) change at IODP Site
   U1352 located in the Canterbury Basin off New Zealand. Planktonic
   foraminiferal assemblages from the site were used to derive SST
   estimates. Comparisons of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage and
   SST record of IODP Site U1352 with those of ODP Site 1119, DSDP Site 594
   and core MD06-2986 allow us to reconstruct the spatial change of the STF
   over the last 450 kyr by locating the positions of its Southland Front
   (SF) section, which runs nearly parallel to the South Island's
   shoreline. The percentage of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma in the sum of
   Nq. pachyderma and Nq. incompta was below 40% at Sites IODP U1352, ODP
   1119 and DSDP 594 during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11c, MIS 7a-c and
   MIS 5e. Moreover, the SSTs of the three sites during these periods were
   similar and close to that of the present-day. This indicates that the
   three sites were covered by a Subtropical Water-Subantarctic Water
   (STW-SAW) mixture during these interglacials. IODP Site U1352 recorded a
   similar scenario during MIS 7e. In comparison with previous studies, the
   higher resolution record of IODP Site U1352 showed the influence of an
   STW-SAW mixture was limited to MIS 11c, MIS 7e, MIS 7a-c and MIS 5e at
   this site. The SSTs of Sites IODP U1352, ODP 1119 and DSDP 594 were
   similar during MIS 11a-b and MIS 9a-d. At the same time, the temperature
   differences among the three sites and core MD06-2986 (west of New
   Zealand) during MIS 11a-b and MIS 9a-d were larger than during
   interglacials MIS 11c, MIS 7a-c, and MIS 5e. These indicate that the
   Subantarctic Water (SAW) influenced Sites IODP U1352, ODP 1119 and DSDP
   594 during MIS 1 lab and MIS 9a-d. The similar to 3-4 degrees C warmer
   SSTs at Sites IODP U1352 and ODP 1119 than at DSDP Site 594 suggest that
   the SF is situated between DSDP Site 594 and Sites IODP U1352, ODP 1119
   during MIS 7d and glacial periods of MIS 10, MIS 8, and MIS 6. Hence,
   unlike previous studies in the region, MIS 7d is identified as a glacial
   period.

AB Rodents are considered as a good model and as a good proxy to
   characterise Quaternary environments. Molars and incisors are the
   best-preserved remains and are found in abundance in the fossil record.
   Since several decades, the lower molars are mostly used for specific
   determinations. Instead of using qualitative and descriptive characters,
   morphometric methods provide now a general quantitative description of
   shape. Applying these new morphometric methods (outline analysis), we
   demonstrate that lower as well as upper molars are useful and efficient
   for palaeontological analyses within voles (Arvicolinae). Herein it is
   made evident that except the first lower molars, the use of all the
   other molars allows the improvement of specific determinations. It
   provides a better representation of abundance and diversity of the
   fossil record and thus involves more accurate paleoenvironmental
   reconstructions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   genetic diversity, distribution, habitat requirements, ecology and life
   cycle, with special emphasis on uses and cultivation, history of
   introduction, impact and management in Europe. C. esculentus is a tuber
   geophyte and most likely originates from the Mediterranean and Southwest
   Asia. It is a variable plant and four wild-type varieties are presently
   recognized, in addition to a cultivated form. C. esculent-us reproduces
   primarily by its underground tubers, although abundant seeds are
   produced. In temperate climates, tubers usually sprout in late spring
   and the plant withers at the beginning of the winter. C. esculentus is
   only cultivated in the Valencia region in Spain. Invasion foci emerged
   across Europe at the beginning of the 1980s and at present, C.
   esculentus is most abundant on arable land and in ruderal habitats,
   followed by riverine vegetation. In heavily infested regions of Europe,
   C esculentus causes substantial yield losses in field crops and although
   different management strategies are available, C. esculentus remains
   difficult to control. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB In temperate regions, Drosophila melanogaster has perennial
   overwintering populations. These populations present seasonal
   variations, under the influence of developmental temperature, for
   several genetically determined physiological traits. The capacity of
   virgin females to control ovulation is one of these characteristics.
   Phenotypes able to postpone egg-laying in the absence of insemination
   are favored under low temperature development and are numerous in Autumn
   generations. Moreover, a shift between Autumn and the following Spring
   has often been observed in favor of these phenotypes. The aim of the
   present study is to determine the characteristics and situations which
   confer an advantage on long as compared with short-retention phenotypes,
   during this non-reproductive period. Several traits were studied:
   resistance to cold shocks, resistance to long cold periods,
   developmental duration and viability, longevity and starvation
   resistance. Long-retention phenotypes (LL) had a longer life expectancy
   than short-retention phenotypes (ss) under virgin or mated status and
   greater resistance to starvation, by avoiding waste material (eggs). At
   14 degreesC, flies that had mated once survived for several months on
   normal substrate with live spermatozoa, and flies on deficient medium
   (without proteins) survived for more than 3 months varying with
   phenotype. Flies with the best chance of overwintering are the
   long-retention phenotypes and some hybrids. The most favorable situation
   for population restoration is when flies are inseminated once in Autumn
   rather than when they remain virgin until Spring, because males die
   sooner than females.

AB Aim Geographical variations in endotherm body size (e.g. Bergmann's
   rule/James's rule and Allen's rule) have long been tested. However, the
   patterns and causes of geographical variation in body size within bat
   species, especially within widespread hibernating species, are little
   known. Here, we evaluated the possible causes of geographical size
   variation patterns in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
   ferrumequinum), a bat species widely distributed across the Palearctic.
   Location Palearctic. Methods We collected body size data (body mass and
   forearm length) from 1,172 adult bats via direct measurements or from
   the literature. We used high-resolution environmental data for the
   sampled sites. We applied multiple linear regressions and an
   information-theoretic approach on separate female and male datasets to
   estimate the support for various hypotheses. Results Temperature and
   latitude failed to predict body mass in both females and males. The best
   model showed that populations with longer forearms in both sexes were
   associated with higher mean temperatures (in the warmest quarter) and
   lower mean temperatures (in the coldest quarter). The independent
   contribution of these temperature parameters to forearm length in both
   sexes was higher than that of all other variables. Main conclusion The
   observed relationship between temperature and body mass was not
   consistent with James's rule, and thus failed to support the heat
   conservation hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions
   of Allen's rule and indicated that direct heat dissipation from the wing
   may be the most likely mechanism underlying geographical variation in
   forearm length. We suggest that the evaluation of the relative
   importance of multiple causal mechanisms may improve our understanding
   of patterns of geographical variation in endotherms.

AB Summit metabolic rate (M-sum, maximum cold-induced metabolic rate) is
   positively correlated with cold tolerance in birds, suggesting that high
   M-sum is important for residency in cold climates. However, the
   phylogenetic distribution of high M-sum among birds and the impact of
   its evolution on current distributions are not well understood. Two
   potential adaptive hypotheses might explain the phylogenetic
   distribution of high M-sum among birds. The cold adaptation hypothesis
   contends that species wintering in cold climates should have higher
   M-sum than species wintering in warmer climates. The flight adaptation
   hypothesis suggests that volant birds might be capable of generating
   high M-sum as a byproduct of their muscular capacity for flight; thus,
   variation in M-sum should be associated with capacity for sustained
   flight, one indicator of which is migration. We collected M-sum data
   from the literature for 44 bird species and conducted both conventional
   and phylogenetically informed statistical analyses to examine the
   predictors of M-sum variation. Significant phylogenetic signal was
   present for log body mass, log mass-adjusted M-sum, and average
   temperature in the winter range. In multiple regression models, log body
   mass, winter temperature, and clade were significant predictors of log
   M-sum. These results are consistent with a role for climate in
   determining M-sum in birds, but also indicate that phylogenetic signal
   remains even after accounting for associations indicative of adaptation
   to winter temperature. Migratory strategy was never a significant
   predictor of log M-sum in multiple regressions, a result that is not
   consistent with the flight adaptation hypothesis.

AB Leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) coupling maximum assimilation
   rate (A(max)) and transpirable water lost via stomatal conductance
   (g(sc)) has been gaining increasing concern in sustainable crop
   production. Factors that influence leaf A(max) and WUEi in rice (Oryza
   sativa L. cv Unkang) at flooding and rainfed conditions were evaluated.
   Positive correlations for leaf nitrogen content (N-m) and maximum
   carboxylation rate (V-cmax), for nitrogen allocation in Rubisco enzymes
   and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) were evident independent of cropping
   cultures. Rainfed rice exhibited enriched canopy leaf average N-m
   resulting in higher A(max), partially supporting improved leaf WUEi.
   Maximum WUEi (up to 0.14 mu mol mmol(-1)) recorded in rainfed rice under
   drought conditions resulted from increasing g(m)/g(sc) ratio while at
   cost of significant decline in A(max) due to hydraulically constrained
   g(sc). A(max) sensitivity related to g(sc) which was regulated by plant
   hydraulic conductance. WUEi was tightly correlated to V-cmax/g(sc) and
   g(m)/g(sc) ratios across the paddy and rainfed not to light environment,
   morphological and physiological traits, highlighting enhance capacity of
   N-m accumulation in rainfed rice with g(sc) at moderately high level
   similar to paddy rice facilitate optimization in A(max) and WUEi while,
   is challenged by drought-vulnerable plant hydraulic conductance. (c)

AB Understanding the genetic basis of Rubisco activase (RCA) gene
   regulation and altering its expression levels to optimize Rubisco
   activation may provide an approach to enhance plant productivity.
   However, the genetic mechanisms and the effect of RCA expression on
   phenotype are still unknown in soybean. This work analysed the
   expression of RCA genes and demonstrated that two RCA isoforms presented
   different expression patterns. Compared with GmRCA, GmRCA was expressed
   at higher mRNA and protein levels. In addition, GmRCA and GmRCA were
   positively correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and seed
   yield, suggesting that changes in expression of RCA has a potential
   applicability in breeding for enhanced soybean productivity. To identify
   the genetic factors that cause expression level variation of GmRCA,
   expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping was combined with
   allele mining in a natural population including 219 landraces. The eQTL
   mapping showed that a combination of both cis- and trans-acting eQTLs
   might control GmRCA expression. As promoters can affect both cis- and
   trans-acting eQTLs by altering cis-acting regulatory elements or
   transcription factor binding sites, this work subsequently focused on
   the promoter region of GmRCA. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the
   GmRCA promoter were identified and shown to correlate with expression
   level diversity. These SNPs were classified into two groups, A and B.
   Further transient expression showed that GUS expression driven by the
   group A promoter was stronger than that by the group B promoter,
   suggesting that promoter sequence types could influence gene expression
   levels. These results would improve understanding how variation within
   promoters affects gene expression and, ultimately, phenotypic diversity
   in natural populations.

AB Beekeeping with the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is important in
   tropical regions but scant information is available on the possible
   consequences of global warming for tropical beekeeping. We evaluated the
   effect of heat stress on developmental stability, the age at onset of
   foraging (AOF) and longevity in Africanized honey bees (AHBs) in the
   Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, one of the main honey producing areas in
   the Neotropics, where high temperatures occur in spring and summer. To
   do so, we reared worker AHB pupae under a fluctuating temperature
   regime, simulating current tropical heatwaves, with a high temperature
   peak of 40.0 degrees C for 1 h daily across six days, and compared them
   to control pupae reared at stable temperatures of 34.0-35.5 degrees C.
   Heat stress did not markedly affect overall body size, though the
   forewing of heat-stressed bees was slightly shorter than controls.
   However, bees reared under heat stress showed significantly greater
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in forewing shape. Heat stress also decreased
   AOF and reduced longevity. Our results show that changes occur in the
   phenotype and behavior of honey bees under heat stress, with potential
   consequences for colony fitness.

AB The integrated function of the setal filter-basket and the pleopodal
   pump in the burrowing amphipod Corophium volutator was studied by
   video-microscopy in order to evaluate the energy costs of filter
   feeding. Video-microscope observations indicated that, in general, nine
   short, water-pumping beat cycles of the pleopods are succeeded by one
   slow cycle that coincides with cleaning of the setal filter and
   transient slowdown of inhalant water velocity. The position of the
   plumose setal filter on the second pair of gnathopods ensures that all
   water runs through the filter-basket. The fine V-shaped bristles on the
   setae enlarge the total filter area so that the velocity of water
   flowing through the filter is relatively slow, about 2.5 mm s(-1),
   giving rise to a resistance of about 2.9 mm H2O, which is the most
   important contribution to the total pressure drop in the system. In
   "standard" individuals of C. volutator with lengths of 3 and 6 mm, the
   normal operating pump pressure and pumping rate were, respectively, 2.6
   and 3.1 mm H2O, and 18.3 and 85.5 ml h(-1); the overall pump
   efficiencies were 5.1% and 11.6%, respectively. These results show that
   the Corophium filter-pump is comparable to other low-pressure biological
   pumps in filter-feeding marine invertebrates, such as mussels,
   polychaetes, ascidians, and bryozoans.

AB Aim In order to understand how ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi)
   may respond to future environmental change, we investigated five biotic
   and environmental factors potentially responsible for explaining
   body-size variation in this species across California. We examined the
   concordance of spatial patterns with temporal body-size change since the
   last glacial maximum (LGM).
   Location California, western North America.
   Methods We quantified body size of modern populations of ground
   squirrels (n = 81) and used a model-selection approach to determine the
   best variables (sex, vegetation, number of congeners, temperature and/or
   precipitation) explaining geographical variation in body size among
   modern populations. We also quantified body size of one fossil
   population in northern California (n = 39) and compared temporal
   body-size change in S. beecheyi at this location since the LGM with
   model predictions.
   Results Body size of modern populations conformed to Bergmann's rule,
   with larger individuals in northern (wetter and cooler) portions of
   California. However, the models suggest that precipitation, rather than
   temperature or other variables, may best explain variation in body size
   across modern spatial gradients. Our conclusion is supported by the
   temporal data, demonstrating that the body size of S. beecheyi has
   increased in northern California since the LGM, concordant with
   precipitation but not temperature change in the region.
   Main conclusions Precipitation, rather than temperature, vegetation or
   number of congeneric species, was the main factor explaining both
   spatial and temporal patterns of body-size variation in S. beecheyi. The
   integration of space and time provides a powerful mechanism for
   predicting how local populations may respond to current and future
   climatic changes.

AB Chrysophyte algae produce siliceous resting stages (stomatocysts) that
   are indicators of past environmental conditions. The objective of this
   study was to assess their strength for climate reconstructions.
   Stomatocysts were collected using sediment traps exposed in 45 mountain
   lakes (1502-2309 m a.s.l., Austrian Alps). Bihourly water-temperature
   measurements were used to determine dates of freezing and break-up,
   spring and autumn mixing. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed
   that the stomatocyst assemblages were related to the dates of ice
   break-up and spring mixing. The two dates are controlled by
   winter/spring air temperature. We developed a weighted averaging-partial
   least squares (WA-PLS) stomatocyst/date-of-spring-mixing regression and
   calibration model (R-boot(2) = 0.85), and reconstructed 'dates of spring
   mixing' for Jezero v Ledvici (1824 m a.s.l., Slovenian Alps) from AD
   1842 to 1996. Sample-specific standard errors of prediction corresponded
   to 0.6 degrees C - 1.0 degrees C. Despite dating uncertainties and poor
   fits of fossil assemblages with the training set, reconstructed 'dates
   of spring mixing' were significantly correlated with the mean
   March-April air temperature, which is known to drive break-up dates.
   Furthermore, the record was in agreement with glacier advances during
   the Little Ice Age.

AB The Northern cod stock has previously been described as undergoing a
   large-scale denatant-contranatant migration during which spawning occurs
   primarily in the north off Labrador. Eggs and larvae are advected
   southward to the inshore areas along the NE coast of Newfoundland where
   they settle as juveniles, then there is a gradual return migration to
   the northern spawning areas. We examined abundance distributions of
   pelagic juvenile (0-group) cod in the fall between inshore and offshore
   areas to determine if these fish occurred predominantly inshore
   following pelagic drift. Comparison between areas demonstrated no
   differences in abundances and mean sizes. Our results do not support the
   concept of large-scale advection of eggs and larvae spawned offshore to
   inshore areas, but indicate that cod eggs spawned offshore remain
   offshore. Back calculations of spawning times indicate the pelagic
   juvenile cod sampled offshore were spawned predominantly in April,
   whereas fish caught inshore were spawned predominantly in May-June, as
   well as April. Estimates of spawning abundance indicate that the inshore
   areas along the NE coast of Newfoundland may represent <10% of eggs
   spawned annually. Historically, the offshore area appears to have been
   the primary habitat for pelagic juvenile cod.

AB In order to provide better fisheries management and conservation
   decisions, there is a need to discern the underlying relationship
   between the spawning stock and recruitment of marine fishes, a
   relationship which is influenced by the environmental conditions. Here,
   we demonstrate how the environmental conditions (temperature and the
   food availability for fish larvae) influence the stock-recruitment
   relationship and indeed what kind of stock-recruitment relationship we
   might see under different environmental conditions. Using unique
   zooplankton data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, we find that
   food availability (i.e. zooplankton) in essence determines which model
   applies for the once large North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Further,
   we show that recruitment is strengthened during cold years and weakened
   during warm years. Our combined model explained 45 per cent of the total
   variance in cod recruitment, while the traditional Ricker and
   Beverton-Holt models only explained about 10 per cent. Specifically, our
   approach predicts that a full recovery of the North Sea cod stock might
   not be expected until the environment becomes more favourable.

AB Vrana Lake is a coastal karst lake on Cres Island within the eastern
   Adriatic coast. It appears to have formed as a cryptodepression on
   karstified carbonate rocks, and is filled with fresh water. It is
   classified as an oligotrophic hydrosystem and serves as a natural water
   supply reservoir (max. depth 74.5 m; surface area 5.5 km(2); water
   volume 220 x 10(6) m(3)). The aim of this study was to assess the
   influence of seasonally and spatially varying ecological conditions
   (i.e., thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen, orthophosphate and
   chlorophyll a concentrations) on the vertical distribution of the
   rotifer plankton community in this geomorphologically and hydrologically
   specific coastal lake. The rotifer community was surveyed monthly over a
   one year period. During the study period, a total of 21 rotifer taxa
   were identified. Among them Ascomorpha spp. (including A. ecaudis, A.
   ovalis and A. saltans), Filinia terminalis, Keratella cochlearis,
   Synchaeta gr. tremula-oblonga and Polyarthra vulgaris prevailed,
   representing 92% of the total rotifer abundance. Measured seasonal and
   spatial patterns of the rotifer assemblage along a vertical profile of
   Vrana Lake were considerably affected by temperature, food availability
   and biotic (competition, predation) interactions in the zooplankton
   community.

AB delta(18)O values of mollusks recovered from near-shore marine cores in
   northwest Iceland quantify significant variation in seasonal temperature
   over the period from similar to 360 B:C: to similar to A:D: 1660.
   Twenty-six aragonitic bivalve specimens were selected to represent
   intervals of climatic interest by using core sedimentological
   characteristics. Carbonate powder was sequentially micromilled from
   shell surfaces concordant with growth banding and analyzed for stable
   oxygen (delta(18)O) and carbon (delta(13)C) isotope values. Because
   delta(18)O values record subseasonal temperature variation over the
   lifetime of the bivalves, these data provide the first 2,000-year
   secular record of North Atlantic seasonality from ca. 360 cal yr B.C. to
   cal yr A.D. 1660. Notable cold periods (360 B.C. to 240 B.C.; A. D. 410;
   and A.D. 1380 to 1420) and warm periods (230 B.C. to A.D. 140 and A.D.
   640 to 760) are resolved in terms of contrast between summer and winter
   temperatures and seasonal temperature variability. Literature from the
   Viking Age (ca. 790 to 1070) during the establishment of Norse colonies
   (and later) in Iceland and Greenland permits comparisons between the
   delta(18)O temperature record and historical records, thereby
   demonstrating the impact of seasonal climatic extremes on the
   establishment, development, and, in some cases, collapse of societies in
   the North Atlantic.

AB RNA/DNA ratios and larval growth of winter and spring-spawned sardine
   larvae (Sardina pilchardus), from the southern coast of Spain were
   studied in 1997 and 1998. Seasonal variations of larval growth and
   RNA/DNA ratios were analysed in relation to environmental variables.
   Oceanographic features in the area of study are strongly influenced by
   the flow of nutrient-poor Atlantic water, which enters the Alboran Sea
   through the Gibraltar Strait. In 1997, the influence of Atlantic water
   was stronger in spring than in winter, leading to lower salinity in
   spring 1997. The predominance of Atlantic waters could cause lower
   chlorophyll-a concentration in spring 1997 than expected for this
   season. In addition, lower microzooplankton biomass was observed in
   spring 1997 than in winter 1997. In concordance with microzooplankton
   biomass, the RNA/DNA ratio of sardine larvae was higher in winter 1997
   than in spring 1997. No seasonal differences in somatic or otolith
   growth rates were observed in 1997, which could be due to a time lag in
   the response of larval growth to changing environmental conditions.
   Unlike the previous year, during 1998, no seasonal changes were observed
   in the amount of incoming Atlantic waters, as evidenced by salinity
   values. In 1998, temperature and microzooplankton biomass were higher in
   spring than in winter, causing higher somatic and otolith growth rates
   in spring 1998. The higher temperatures observed in spring 1998 compared
   to winter 1998 could be responsible of a decline in the RNA/DNA ratio of
   spring-spawned sardine larvae in comparison to winter-spawned larvae.
   Larval growth and RNA/DNA ratios may show a different response to
   changes in the environment, particularly temperature. It its known that
   temperature has a positive effect on growth rates but it has a negative
   effect on the RNA/DNA ratio, then it is recommended to bear in mind
   these effects, particularly when joint analysis of larval growth and
   RNA/DNA ratios are carried out. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Thermal adaptation to spatially varying environmental conditions occurs
   in a wide range of species, but what is less clear is the nature of
   fitness trade-offs associated with this temperature adaptation. Here,
   populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are
   examined at both local and latitudinal scales to determine whether these
   populations have evolved differences in their survival under high
   temperature stress. A clear pattern of increasing high temperature
   stress tolerance is seen with decreasing latitude, consistent with
   temperature adaptation. Additionally, there is also evidence for
   significant variation in thermal tolerance on a smaller scale. The
   competitive fitness of pairs of northern and southern copepod
   populations were also examined under a series of lower, more moderate
   temperatures. These fitness assays show that the southern populations
   that have the best survival under extreme high temperatures have lowered
   competitive fitness at the lower temperatures tested, whereas the
   fitness of the southern populations exceeded that of the northern
   populations at the highest temperatures tested. Combined, these results
   suggest that there may be evolutionary trade-offs between performance at
   high and stressful temperatures and fitness at moderate temperatures in
   this species.

AB Linkages between climate variability and the productivity and
   functioning of Gulf of Mexico marine ecosystems remain poorly described,
   largely due to a lack of time series sufficiently long to establish
   robust bio-physical relationships. To address this issue, multidecadal
   biochronologies were generated from otolith growth-increment widths of
   red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, gray snapper L. griseus, black drum
   Pogonia cromis, and king mackerel Scomberomorus cavalla in the Gulf of
   Mexico. Synchronous growth patterns were evident among red snapper, gray
   snapper, and black drum, which all significantly (p < 0.05) correlated
   to one other, but not with king mackerel. Positive growth anomalies in
   the snapper and drum chronologies were associated with anomalously warm
   sea surface temperatures, southeast wind stress, and high sea level
   pressure in the western Atlantic during the early spring months,
   suggesting that an early transition from a winter to a summer climate
   pattern is favorable for growth. In contrast, the king mackerel
   chronology was dominated by decadal-scale patterns and significantly (p
   < 0.01) and negatively correlated to the Atlantic Multidecadal
   Oscillation. Overall, these results show the importance of the spring
   transition for resident species in the northern Gulf of Mexico, that
   growth among individuals in a migratory species can be synchronous, and
   that differences in life history and geography are reflected in
   climate-biology relationships.

   shocks, poor nutrition, and ethanol added to the medium, which markedly
   decreased viability. For wing traits, heritabilities were relatively
   lower in the stressful environment, while heritabilities for bristle
   traits were not influenced by conditions. Heritability changes were
   largely due to an increase in the environmental variance under stress,
   whereas levels of additive genetic variance were relatively constant.
   Evolvabilities were similar between environments except for crossvein

AB Temperature changes affect salmonids across a hierarchy of spatial and
   temporal scales, so that shifts in thermal river regimes may influence
   interspecific interactions in sympatric species. In Northern Norway,
   anadromous populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar) coexist, but in recent years landings of Arctic
   charr have decreased, while those of Atlantic salmon have been stable or
   even increased. Here we studied relative abundance, habitat use and
   growth rate of sympatric stream-living juveniles of both species in
   Veidnes River, where they are the only fish species present. In
   1998/2000, juvenile Arctic charr dominated, especially in the upper and
   colder part of the river. In 2010, however, Atlantic salmon juveniles
   were now prominent in all habitat types, whereas nearly all Arctic charr
   were captured in slow-flowing water near the river bank. Summer air
   temperature has increased in the region during the last decade. Positive
   correlations between summer temperatures and back-calculated growth
   rates were documented in both species, but the growth response was
   significantly higher in Atlantic salmon. Accordingly, we suggest that
   juvenile Atlantic salmon may benefit from a warmer climate in
   northernmost Norway, at the expense of the more cold-water-adapted
   Arctic charr.

AB Ocean temperature increase is recognised as one of the major threats to
   the future of coral reefs. During the past 50 years, global mean
   temperatures have risen by 0.13 degrees C/decade, but in the Caribbean
   warming trends are greater, and are of the order of 0.29 degrees
   C/decade. In light of this threat, some researchers have proposed that
   reefs may survive better in locations of naturally low thermal stress,
   and have hypothesised that such refugia may be located in: (1) deep
   areas; (2) areas of high currents; (3) upwelling; and (4) high-latitude
   areas. These regions have been targeted as priorities for conservation
   activities; however, with the exception of deep reefs, formal assessment
   of the efficacy of these potential refugia is lacking. Here we tested
   the three remaining hypotheses in the wider Caribbean region using
   remotely sensed data and hydrodynamic model outputs. We began by
   determining the location of the hypothesised refugia, and then
   quantified the extent to which they minimise acute and chronic thermal
   stress in a significant and consistent manner through time. Furthermore,
   recognising the increasing sea warming and the concern that high
   temperatures could frequently exceed lethal thresholds for many
   organisms in the future, we assessed the ability of these areas to slow
   the rates of increase of temperatures. We show that the proposed areas
   do not constitute meaningful refugia from acute thermal stress. However,
   upwelling areas in the Caribbean have conservation utility because rates
   of thermal warming are lower. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resistance to body dehydration (BD)
   are important physiological traits that have an effect on water balance
   and the amount of energy available for activity and production, and thus
   could contribute to variation in life history traits expressed across a
   range of environments. Few studies have tested whether SMR and BD show
   consistent between-individual variation in molluscs. Significant
   repeatability of SMR and BD indicates that the traits might be heritable
   and therefore a possible target for natural selection, so describing the
   repeatability of SMR and BD is important in studies of phenotypic
   variability. Here, we studied energy metabolism (body mass-corrected
   SMR) and the change in the scaling relationship of SMR and body mass in
   response to time between measurements in the giant garden slug Limax
   maximus. Limax maximus is one of the most invasive terrestrial molluscs,
   with a wide geographical distribution, and is considered an important
   pest of horticultural and agricultural crops. Our results show that L.
   maximus follows the expected relationship of increasing SMR with
   increasing mass, but the scaling exponent varies through time and is
   different from that described for other gastropods. We also found
   significant inter-individual variation in VCO2 Mean, VCO2 Min, VCO2 Max,
   and BD (t=0.25, 0.29, 0.24, 0.22, p<0.05, respectively), and significant
   repeatability of body mass (t=0.90). To our knowledge, this is the first
   comprehensive analysis of the repeatability of body mass-corrected SMR
   and BD in terrestrial slugs. Our results suggest that energy metabolism
   and water balance could potentially respond to selection.

AB Ocean tides and winter surface storms are among the main factors driving
   the dynamics and spatial structure of marine coastal species, but the
   understanding of their impact on deep-sea and hydrothermal vent
   communities is still limited. Multidisciplinary deep-sea observatories
   offer an essential tool to study behavioural rhythms and interactions
   between hydrothermal community dynamics and environmental fluctuations.
   Here, we investigated whether species associated with a Ridgeia piscesae
   tubeworm vent assemblage respond to local ocean dynamics. By tracking
   variations in vent macrofaunal abundance at different temporal scales,
   we provide the first evidence that tides and winter surface storms
   influence the distribution patterns of mobile and non-symbiotic
   hydrothermal species (i.e. pycnogonids Sericosura sp. and Polynoidae
   polychaetes) at more than 2 km depth. Local ocean dynamics affected the
   mixing between hydrothermal fluid inputs and surrounding seawater,
   modifying the environmental conditions in vent habitats. We suggest that
   hydrothermal species respond to these habitat modifications by adjusting
   their behaviour to ensure optimal living conditions. This behaviour may
   reflect a specific adaptation of vent species to their highly variable
   habitat.

AB The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to overcrowding and
   scarcity of food by arresting development as a dauer larva, a
   nonfeeding, long-lived, stress-resistant, alternative third-larval
   stage. Previous work has shown that mutations in the genes daf-2
   (encoding a member of the insulin receptor family) and age-1 (encoding a
   PI 3-kinase) result in constitutive formation of dauer larvae (Daf-c),
   increased adult longevity (Age), and increased intrinsic thermotolerance
   (Itt). Some daf-2 mutants have additional developmental, behavioral, and
   reproductive defects. We have characterized in detail 15
   temperature-sensitive and 1 nonconditional daf-2 allele to investigate
   the extent of daf-2 mutant defects and to examine whether specific
   mutant traits correlate with each other. The greatest longevity seen in
   daf-2 mutant adults was approximately three times that of wild type. The
   temperature-sensitive daf-2 mutants fell into two overlapping classes,
   including eight class 1 mutants, which are Daf-c, Age, and Itt, and
   exhibit low levels of L1 arrest at 25.5 degrees. Seven class 2 mutants
   also exhibit the class I defects as well as some or all of the
   following: reduced adult motility, abnormal adult body and gonad
   morphology, high levels of embryonic and L1 arrest, production of
   progeny late in life, and reduced brood size. The strengths of the
   Daf-c, Age, and Itt phenotypes largely correlated with each other but
   not with the strength of class 2-specific defects. This suggests that
   the DAF-2 receptor is bifunctional. Examination of the null phenotype
   revealed a maternally rescued egg, L1 lethal component, and a
   nonconditional Daf-c component. With respect to the Daf-c phenotype, the
   dauer-defective (Daf-d) mutation daf-12(m20) was epistatic to daf-2
   class 1 alleles but not the severe class 2 alleles tested. All daf-2
   mutant defects were suppressed by the daf-d mutation daf-16(m26). Our
   findings suggest a new model for daf-2, age-1, daf-12 and daf-16
   interactions.

   temperature and sum of precipitation. Of the 10 chronologies,
   growth-climate relations could not be modeled for tree-ring width
   chronologies of the three species at their lower distribution limits
   because of low correlation. Annual mean temperature and annual sum of
   precipitation will increase about 3 degrees C and 100 mm, respectively,
   by 2100 in central Japan, according to 18 climatic change scenarios (6
   general circulation models x3 greenhouse gasses emission scenarios). We
   predicted tree-ring widths and maximum latewood densities by
   substituting 18 climatic change scenarios into the growth-climate
   models. Maximum latewood densities and tree-ring widths of A. mariesii
   at the upper and lower distribution limits increased by 2100. The rates
   of the increase tended to be greater for scenarios with more greenhouse
   gas emission. By contrast, maximum latewood densities of A. veitchii and
   tree-ring widths of B. ermanii were unchanged by 2100, irrespective of
   the three greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This study showed that
   radial growth of the three species responds differently to global
   warming and their responses are predictable by dendrochronological
   models.

AB P>In this study, we used a canopy photosynthesis model which describes
   changes in photosynthetic capacity with slow temperature-dependent
   acclimations.
   A flux-partitioning algorithm was applied to fit the photosynthesis
   model to net ecosystem exchange data for 12 evergreen coniferous forests
   from northern temperate and boreal regions.
   The model accounted for much of the variation in photosynthetic
   production, with modeling efficiencies (mean > 67%) similar to those of
   more complex models. The parameter describing the rate of acclimation
   was larger at the northern sites, leading to a slower acclimation of
   photosynthesis to temperature. The response of the rates of
   photosynthesis to air temperature in spring was delayed up to several
   days at the coldest sites. Overall photosynthesis acclimation processes
   were slower at colder, northern locations than at warmer, more southern,
   and more maritime sites.
   Consequently, slow changes in photosynthetic capacity were essential to
   explaining variations of photosynthesis for colder boreal forests (i.e.
   where acclimation of photosynthesis to temperature was slower), whereas
   the importance of these processes was minor in warmer conifer evergreen
   forests.

AB The El Nino-Southern Oscillation exerts a large influence on global
   climate regimes and on the global carbon cycle. Although El Nino is
   known to be associated with a reduction of the global total land carbon
   sink, results based on prognostic models or measurements disagree over
   the relative contribution of photosynthesis to the reduced sink. Here,
   we provide an independent remote sensing-based analysis on the impact of
   the 2015-2016 El Nino on global photosynthesis using six global
   satellite-based photosynthesis products and a global solar-induced
   fluorescence (SIF) dataset. An ensemble of satellite-based
   photosynthesis products showed a negative anomaly of -0.7 +/- 1.2 PgC in
   2015, but a slight positive anomaly of 0.05 +/- 0.89 PgC in 2016, which
   when combined with observations of the growth rate of atmospheric carbon
   dioxide concentrations suggests that the reduction of the land residual
   sink was likely dominated by photosynthesis in 2015 but by respiration
   in 2016. The six satellite-based products unanimously identified a major
   photosynthesis reduction of -1.1 +/- 0.52 PgC from savannahs in 2015 and
   2016, followed by a highly uncertain reduction of -0.22 +/- 0.98 PgC
   from rainforests. Vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere enhanced
   photosynthesis before and after the peak El Nino, especially in
   grasslands (0.33 +/- 0.13 PgC). The patterns of satellite-based
   photosynthesis ensemble mean were corroborated by SIF, except in
   rainforests and South America, where the anomalies of satellite-based
   photosynthesis products also diverged the most. We found the inter-model
   variation of photosynthesis estimates was strongly related to the
   discrepancy between moisture forcings for models. These results
   highlight the importance of considering multiple photosynthesis proxies
   when assessing responses to climatic anomalies.
   This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the
   2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns,

AB In dipterans, the wing-beat frequency, and, hence, the lift generated,
   increases linearly with ambient temperature. If flight performance is an
   important target of natural selection, higher wing:thorax size ratio and
   wing-aspect ratio should be favored at low temperatures because they
   increase the lift for a given body weight. We investigated this
   hypothesis by examining wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio in
   Drosophila melanogaster collected from wild populations along a
   latitudinal gradient and in their descendants reared under standard
   laboratory conditions. In a subset of lines, we also studied the
   phenotypic plasticity of these traits in response to temperature. To
   examine whether the latitudinal trends in wing:thorax size ratio and
   wing-aspect ratio could have resulted from a correlated response to
   latitudinal selection on wing area, we investigated the correlated
   responses of these characters in lines artificially selected for wing
   area. In both the geographic and the artificially selected lines,
   wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio decreased in response to
   increasing temperature during development. Phenotypic plasticity for
   either trait did not vary among latitudinal lines or selective regimes.
   Wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio increased significantly
   with latitude in field-collected flies. The dine in wing:thorax size
   ratio had a genetic component, but the dine in wing-aspect ratio did
   not. Artificial selection for increased wing area led to a statistically
   insignificant correlated increase in wing:thorax size ratio and a
   decrease in wing-aspect ratio. Our observations are consistent with the
   hypotheses that high wing-thorax size ratio and wing aspect ratio are
   per se selectively advantageous at low temperatures.

AB Social behaviour emerges from the local environment but is constrained
   by the animal's life history and its evolutionary lineage. In this
   perspective, we consider the genus Drosophila and provide an overview of
   how these constraints can shape how individuals interact. Our focus is
   restricted to visual and chemical signals and how their use varies
   across species during courtship - currently the only social behaviour
   well-studied across many Drosophila species. We broadly categorize
   species into four climatic groups - cosmopolitan, tropical, temperate
   and arid - which serve as discussion points as we review comparative
   behavioural and physiological studies and relate them to the abiotic
   conditions of a species environment. We discuss how the physiological
   and behavioural differences among many fly species may reflect life
   history differences as much as, or even more than, differences in
   phylogeny. This perspective serves not only to summarize what has been
   studied across drosophilids, but also to identify questions and outline
   gaps in the literature worth pursuing for progressing the understanding
   of behavioural evolution in Drosophila.

AB Growth rates have complex sources and may determine adult body size in
   organisms with indeterminate growth. Thus, the interpretation of
   interpopulation differences in body size along geographical gradients
   requires the examination of growth and to distinguish between the
   proximal and ultimate causes of it. Several studies support a link
   between growth rates and habitat production via climatic effects.
   Environmental constraints, such as food abundance, may be correlated
   with climatic conditions and could, in turn, limit growth rate because
   of limited energy availability. We performed a reciprocal transplant
   experiment to disentangle the effects of environmental and genetic
   factors on body size interpopulational divergence in the lizard Podarcis
   guadarramae along a 500-m elevation gradient with contrasting
   environmental conditions. Our results showed that the growing
   environment determined growth rates of juvenile lizards, independently
   of the population of origin. Hatchlings experiencing the high-altitude
   growing environment, which had colder and more humid climatic
   conditions, grew faster than those growing in the low-altitude
   environment. However, mother's site of origin did not affect growth. We
   conclude that the drivers of growth rate differences in P. guadarramae
   lizards are probably related to between-sites differences in water and
   food availability.

AB Correlation analyses and stepwise regression models were run to examine
   relationships between the marine survival of Auke Creek coho salmon
   Oncorhynchus kisutch and a number of physical and biological covariates:
   local sea surface temperature, local precipitation, local hatchery
   releases of pink salmon O. gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta, regional
   and state coho and pink salmon catches, and smolt survival of three
   other regional coho salmon stocks. Auke Creek jack return rates and
   adult marine survival covaried, indicating that a significant amount of
   the variation in marine survival is due to conditions encountered in the
   first 4 to 5 months of marine life. Sea surface temperature was not
   significantly correlated with adult survival but was significantly
   associated with jack return rates. Precipitation had no relationship
   with marine survival. The number of locally released hatchery pink and
   chum salmon had the strongest correlation with marine survival (r =
   0.71). Marine survival trends of coho salmon stocks within 64 km of Auke
   Creek closely followed Auke Creek marine survival, indicating that the
   factors affecting the marine survival of coho salmon are similar in
   localized regions of northern Southeast Alaska. Regional similarities in
   marine survival with Auke Creek coho salmon also extend to the larger
   Southeast Alaska region with respect to the analysis of commercial coho
   salmon catch. The specific mechanisms were not identified, but these
   results indicate that biological covariates were more associated with
   Auke Creek coho salmon marine survival than were physical covariates.

AB Demersal fish cannot be readily tracked using data loggers that provide
   satellite-based or light-based geolocation. Moreover, fish that are
   highly mobile within the water column cannot readily be located with
   other methods, such as the tidal location method (TLM). As an
   alternative, we describe a process that provides estimates of geographic
   location by simulating movement paths through geographic locations that
   match temperature and depth data recorded by data loggers. Depths and
   temperatures recorded by data loggers were compared with a North Sea
   temperature and depth database to identify all locations with matching
   data. A movement rate filter was then applied to eliminate spurious
   locations and simulations of possible movement paths through the
   remaining positions were used to generate estimates of the likelihood of
   a particular location having been occupied. The performance of the
   technique was assessed by reconstructing movement paths of artificial
   migrations and by using depth and temperature data collected at known
   locations in the North Sea. Estimates of the positional accuracy and
   error were comparable to the North Sea TLM. Reconstructions of the
   migrations of cod tagged and released in the North Sea were successfully
   achieved with the method. This method has application in defining the
   movements and migrations of commercial species in any sea area where
   databases of commonly measured environmental variables are available.

AB Seed performance after dispersal is highly dependent on parental
   environmental cues, especially during seed formation and maturation.
   Here we examine which environmental factors are the most dominant in
   this respect and whether their effects are dependent on the genotypes
   under investigation. We studied the influence of light intensity,
   photoperiod, temperature, nitrate, and phosphate during seed development
   on five plant attributes and thirteen seed attributes, using 12
   Arabidopsis genotypes that have been reported to be affected in seed
   traits. As expected, the various environments during seed development
   resulted in changed plant and/or seed performances. Comparative analysis
   clearly indicated that, overall, temperature plays the most dominant
   role in both plant and seed performance, whereas light has a prominent
   impact on plant traits. In comparison to temperature and light, nitrate
   mildly affected some of the plant and seed traits while phosphate had
   even less influence on those traits. Moreover, clear
   genotype-by-environment interactions were identified. This was shown by
   the fact that individual genotypes responded differentially to the
   environmental conditions. Low temperature significantly increased seed
   dormancy and decreased seed longevity of NILDOG1 and cyp707a1-1, whereas
   low light intensity increased seed dormancy and decreased seed longevity
   of NILDOG3 and NILDOG6. This also indicates that different genetic and
   molecular pathways are involved in the plant and seed responses. By
   identifying environmental conditions that affect the dormancy vs
   longevity correlation in the same way as previously identified naturally
   occurring loci, we have identified selective forces that probably shaped
   evolution for these important seed traits.

   gonadotrophic differentiation during early gonadal sex differentiation
   were examined in several strains from the Southern population of
   Japanese medaka, namely, Hd-rR, d-rR/Tokyo, d-rR/Shizuoka, and NIESR.
   Gonadal sex differentiation showed a similar pattern in all strains,
   that is, a sex-based difference in germ cell number was observed at
   hatching (XX>XY). In addition, a transition of XX germ cells into
   meiosis was observed at hatching in all strains. However, the ratio of
   meiotic transition of XX germ cells differed among strains, indicating
   that Hd-rR has fewer meiotic cells than other strains.
   Immunohistochemical analysis showed that glycoprotein subunit (Gpa) and
   follicle-stimulating hormone subunit (Fshb), but not luteinizing hormone
   subunit (Lhb), localize to the pituitary at hatching in all strains
   examined. Although no sex differences were observed in the numbers of
   Gpa- and Fshb-positive cells in the pituitary at hatching in Hd-rR,
   d-rR/Tokyo, and NIESR strains, the d-rR/Shizuoka strain showed sex
   differences in the number of Fshb-positive cells at hatching (XX>XY);
   d-rR/Shizuoka is derived from d-rR/Tokyo. Even though d-rR/Shizuoka
   differs from its ancestral strain, d-rR/Tokyo, and Hd-rR in Fshb
   expression pattern, this suggests that d-rR/Shizuoka shows potential for
   use as a model to study the molecular regulatory mechanisms of fshb
   subunit gene expression and Fsh cell differentiation in the pituitary.

AB Photosynthetic capacity and its relationship to leaf nitrogen content
   are two of the most sensitive parameters of terrestrial biosphere models
   (TBM) whose representation in global-scale simulations has been severely
   hampered by a lack of systematic analyses using a sufficiently broad
   database. Here, we use data of qualitative traits, climate and soil to
   subdivide the terrestrial vegetation into functional types (PFT), and
   then assimilate observations of carboxylation capacity, V-max (723 data
   points), and maximum photosynthesis rates, A(max) (776 data points),
   into the C-3 photosynthesis model proposed by Farquhar et al. to
   constrain the relationship of V-max(25) (V-max normalised to 25 degrees
   C) to leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area for each PFT. In a second
   step, the resulting functions are used to predict V-max(25) per PFT from
   easily measurable values of leaf nitrogen content in natural vegetation
   (1966 data points). Mean values of V-max(25) thus obtained are
   implemented into a TBM (BETHY within the coupled climate-vegetation
   model ECHAM5/JSBACH) and modelled gross primary production (GPP) is
   compared with independent observations on stand scale. Apart from
   providing parameter ranges per PFT constrained from much more
   comprehensive data, the results of this analysis enable several major
   improvements on previous parameterisations. (1) The range of mean
   V-max(25) between PFTs is dominated by differences of photosynthetic
   nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, defined as V-max(25) divided by leaf
   nitrogen content), while within each PFT, the scatter of V-max(25)
   values is dominated by the high variability of leaf nitrogen content.
   (2) We find a systematic depression of NUE on certain tropical soils
   that are known to be deficient in phosphorous. (3) V-max(25) of tropical
   trees derived by this study is substantially lower than earlier
   estimates currently used in TBMs, with an obvious effect on modelled GPP
   and surface temperature. (4) The root-mean-squared difference between
   modelled and observed GPP is substantially reduced.

AB Globally, the East Asian monsoon region is one of the richest
   environments in terms of biodiversity. The region is undergoing rapid
   human development, yet its river ecosystems have not been well studied.
   Global warming represents a major challenge to the survival of species
   in this region and makes it necessary to assess and reduce the potential
   consequences of warming on species of conservation concern. We projected
   the effects of global warming on stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Odonata,
   Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EOPT]) diversity and predicted the changes
   of geographical ranges for 121 species throughout South Korea.
   Plecoptera was the most sensitive (decrease of 71.4% in number of
   species from the 2000s through the 2080s) order, whereas Odonata
   benefited (increase of 66.7% in number of species from the 2000s through
   the 2080s) from the effects of global warming. The impact of global
   warming on stream insects was predicted to be minimal prior to the
   2060s; however, by the 2080s, species extirpation of up to 20% in the
   highland areas and 2% in the lowland areas were predicted. The projected
   responses of stream insects under global warming indicated that species
   occupying specific habitats could undergo major reductions in habitat.
   Nevertheless, habitat of 33% of EOPT (including two-thirds of Odonata
   and one-third of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) was
   predicted to increase due to global warming. The community compositions
   predicted by generalized additive models varied over this century, and a
   large difference in community structure in the highland areas was
   predicted between the 2000s and the 2080s. However, stream insect
   communities, especially Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were
   predicted to become more homogenous under global warming. Impacto
   Potencial del Calentamiento Global sobre la Diversidad y la Distribucion
   de Insectos de Arroyo en Corea del Sur
   Resumen A nivel global, la region de monzon del este de Asia es uno de
   los ambientes mas ricos en cuanto a la biodiversidad. La region esta
   sufriendo un rapido desarrollo humano y sus ecosistemas fluviales no han
   sido bien estudiados aun. El calentamiento global representa un
   obstaculo mayor en la supervivencia de las especies en esta region y
   hace necesario estudiar y reducir las consecuencias potenciales del
   calentamiento sobre las especies de importancia para la conservacion.
   Proyectamos los efectos del calentamiento global sobre la diversidad de
   insectos de arroyo (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera
   [EOPT]) y predijimos los cambios de los rangos geograficos para 121
   especies a lo largo y ancho de Corea del Sur. Plecotpera fue el orden
   mas sensible (disminucion del 71.4% en el numero de especies desde el
   2000 hasta la decada de 2080), mientras que Odonata se beneficio de los
   efectos del calentamiento global (incremento del 66.7% desde el 2000
   hasta la decada de 2080). El impacto del calentamiento global sobre
   insectos de arroyo se predijo seria minimo antes de 2060; sin embargo,
   para 2080, se predijo una extirpacion de especies hasta de 20% en las
   areas de tierras altas y del 2% en las areas de tierras bajas. Las
   respuestas proyectadas de insectos de arroyo bajo el calentamiento
   global indicaron que las especies que ocupan habitats especificos
   podrian sufrir una reduccion mayor en el habitat. Sin embargo, se
   predijo que el habitat del 33% de EOPT (incluyendo dos tercios de
   Odonata y un tercio de Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera y Trichoptera)
   incrementaria debido al calentamiento global. Las composiciones de la
   comunidad predichas por modelos aditivos generalizados vario en este
   siglo y una gran diferencia en la estructura de la comunidad en las
   areas de tierras altas se predijo entre 2000 y 2080. Sin embargo, se
   predijo que las comunidades de insectos de arroyo, especialmente
   Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera, se volverian mas homogeneas bajo el
   calentamiento global.

AB This document describes the development of a tool to manage the risk of
   the transportation of cold food without temperature control. The tool
   uses predictions from ComBase predictor and builds on the 2009 U. S.
   Food and Drug Administration Model Food Code and supporting scientific
   data in the Food Code annex. I selected Salmonella spp. and Listeria
   monocytogenes as the organisms for risk management. Salmonella spp. were
   selected because they are associated with a wide variety of foods and
   grow rapidly at temperatures >17 degrees C. L. monocytogenes was
   selected because it is frequently present in the food processing
   environment, it was used in the original analysis contained in the Food
   Code Annex, and it grows relatively rapidly at temperatures <17 degrees
   C. The suitability of a variety of growth models under changing
   temperature conditions is largely supported by the published literature.
   The ComBase predictions under static temperature conditions were
   validated using 148 ComBase database observations for Salmonella spp.
   and L. monocytogenes in real foods. The times and temperature changes
   encompassed by ComBase Predictor models for Salmonella spp. and L.
   monocytogenes are consistent with published data on consumer food
   transport to the home from the grocery store and on representative foods
   from a wholesale cash and carry food service supplier collected as part
   of this project. The resulting model-based tool will be a useful aid to
   risk managers and customers of wholesale cash and carry food service
   suppliers, as well as to anyone interested in assessing and managing the
   risks posed by holding cold foods out of temperature control in
   supermarkets, delis, restaurants, cafeterias, and homes.

AB Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) mutants are extensively used in optical
   microscopy studies of in vivo biological processes in cells.
   Nonetheless, blinking and bleaching of the GFP chromophore at the single
   molecule level greatly limits its usefulness. We have worked out what we
   think are the best experimental conditions for the use of the GFP
   mutant, GFP-mut2, as a single molecule marker in two-photon excitation
   measurements. We have measured molecular brightness, excited state
   lifetime, blinking and photo-bleaching times versus the two-photon
   excitation intensity on proteins embedded in silica gel matrices versus
   the excitation wavelength in the range 700-1,000 nm. Our results
   indicate that GFPmut2 can be employed as a long-lived reporter of

AB The annual formation and loss of some 15 million km(2) of sea ice around
   the Antarctic significantly affects global ocean circulation,
   particularly through the formation of dense bottom water. As one of the
   most profound seasonal changes on Earth, the formation and decay of sea
   ice plays a major role in climate processes. It is also likely to be
   impacted by climate change, potentially changing the productivity of the
   Antarctic region. The sea ice zone supports much wildlife, particularly
   large vertebrates such as seals, seabirds and whales, some exploited to
   near extinction. Cetacean species in the Southern Ocean will be directly
   irnpacted by changes in sea ice patterns as well as indirectly by
   changes in their principal prey, Antarctic krill, affected by
   modifications to their own environment through climate change.
   Understanding how climate change will affect species at all trophic
   levels in the Southern Ocean requires new approaches and integrated
   research programs. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge
   of the sea ice zone and examines the potential for climatic and
   ecological change in the region. In the context of changes already
   documented for seals and seabirds, it discusses potential effects on the
   most conspicuous vertebrate of the region, baleen whales.

AB The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae),
   invaded Japan from North America about 60 years ago. Immediately after
   its invasion - and for the first three decades - its life cycle was
   bivoltine, two generations per year throughout its entire distribution
   in Japan. Thereafter, its life cycle shifted to trivoltine in the
   southwestern areas of Japan. In the present study we examined the
   life-history traits proposed to be implicated in this event with the aim
   of clarifying the mechanism of this life-cycle shift. The critical
   photoperiod for diapause induction, as defined by the photoperiod at
   which 50% of individuals enter diapause, was shorter in the trivoltine
   populations than in their bivoltine counterparts. The temperature
   sensitivity of the photoperiodic response, as defined by the difference
   in the critical photoperiod between 20 and 25 degrees C, was greater in
   the trivoltine populations than in the bivoltine ones. The geographic
   variation in larval and pupal periods was positively correlated to the
   latitude of the original localities of the populations. The change in
   the number of larval instars would be one of the main factors accounting
   for the regional differences in the developmental period. These results
   suggest that some life-history traits of H. cunea have changed following
   its invasion of Japan as an adaptive response to local climates.

AB The extent to which leaf senescence is induced by nitrogen deficiency or
   by sugar accumulation varies between natural accessions of Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana). Analysis of senescence in plants of the Bay-0 X
   Shahdara recombinant inbred line (RIL) population revealed a large
   variation in developmental senescence of the whole leaf rosette, which
   was in agreement with the extent to which glucose (Glc) induced
   senescence in the different lines. To determine the regulatory basis of
   genetic differences in the Glc response, we investigated changes in gene
   expression using Complete Arabidopsis Transcriptome MicroArray (CATMA)
   analysis. Genes whose regulation did not depend on the genetic
   background, as well as genes whose regulation was specific to individual
   RILs, were identified. In RIL 310, a line that does not show the typical
   senescence response to Glc, stress response genes, especially those
   responding to cold stress, were induced by Glc. We therefore tested
   whether cold acclimation delays senescence by reducing sugar
   sensitivity. In cold-acclimated plants, leaf senescence was severely
   delayed and Glc did not induce the typical senescence response.
   Together, our results suggest that cold acclimation extends rosette
   longevity by affecting metabolic regulation of senescence, thereby
   allowing vernalization-dependent plants to survive the winter period.
   The role of functional chloroplasts and of nitrogen and phosphate
   availability in this regulation is discussed.

AB Experimental evolution via continuous culture is a powerful approach to
   the alteration of complex phenotypes, such as optimal/maximal growth
   temperatures. The benefit of this approach is that phenotypic selection
   is tied to growth rate, allowing the production of optimized strains.
   Herein, we demonstrate the use of a recently described long-term culture
   apparatus called the Evolugator for the generation of a thermophilic
   descendant from a mesophilic ancestor (Escherichia coli MG1655). In
   addition, we used whole-genome sequencing of sequentially isolated
   strains throughout the thermal adaptation process to characterize the
   evolutionary history of the resultant genotype, identifying 31 genetic
   alterations that may contribute to thermotolerance, although some of
   these mutations may be adaptive for off-target environmental parameters,
   such as rich medium. We undertook preliminary phenotypic analysis of
   mutations identified in the glpF and fabA genes. Deletion of glpF in a
   mesophilic wild-type background conferred significantly improved growth
   rates in the 43-to-48 degrees C temperature range and altered optimal
   growth temperature from 37 degrees C to 43 degrees C. In addition,
   transforming our evolved thermotolerant strain (EVG1064) with a
   wild-type allele of glpF reduced fitness at high temperatures. On the
   other hand, the mutation in fabA predictably increased the degree of
   saturation in membrane lipids, which is a known adaptation to elevated
   temperature. However, transforming EVG1064 with a wildtype fabA allele
   had only modest effects on fitness at intermediate temperatures. The
   Evolugator is fully automated and demonstrates the potential to
   accelerate the selection for complex traits by experimental evolution
   and significantly decrease development time for new industrial strains.

AB The C-4 African grass, Pennisetum setaceum (fountaingrass), has a
   greater altitudinal distribution than any other grass on the island of
   Hawaii. Clones of P. setaceum were reciprocally transplanted among
   coastal dry grassland, montane dry shrubland, and subalpine dry forest
   sites on the leeward side of Hawaii to evaluate the contribution of
   local adaptation and individual tolerance to the broad ecological
   amplitude of this grass. Physiological, growth, and reproductive
   responses differed among sites without evidence of local adaptation.
   Greatest tiller production and the highest photosynthetic rates were
   observed at the mid-altitude site, but plants at the coastal site
   attained greater basal areas, aboveground biomass, and number of
   inflorescences. Correlation among the responses of different plant
   characters was environmentally dependent, suggesting that the integrated
   expression of these characters is also plastic. Few differences in plant
   responses, however, were attributable to a population's origin or the
   site-by-population interaction; resident populations and introduced
   populations responded similarly at each site. Furthermore, few
   characters exhibited variation among clones, indicating that these
   populations likely possess little genetic variation. Limited clonal
   variation was, however, detected for net photosynthesis, the ratio of
   internal to ambient CO2 concentration (c(i)/c(a)), and specific leaf
   area, but only on two of five dates over a 1-yr period. Phenotypic
   plasticity for both individual characters and the integration of
   physiological and morphological characters have apparently been most
   important in allowing P. setaceum to become dominant across diverse
   habitats on Hawaii.

AB Temperature is crucial for reptiles, also during embryonic development,
   particularly for species with temperature-dependent sex determination.
   Under natural conditions, Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) eggs
   are influenced by thermal changes in the interior of the nest related to
   the external environmental temperature. As nests are subject to
   variations in temperature and most lab studies on crocodilian incubation
   have been carried out at constant temperatures, we were interested in
   determining how temperature fluctuations may affect the development of
   caiman embryos. We investigated the effects of incubation at constant
   temperatures (31 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 33 degrees C) and
   fluctuating temperatures (31 +/- 2, 32 +/- 1, and 32 +/- 2 degrees C) on
   the following aspects: incubation period duration, hatching success, sex
   ratio, total length, and body mass of C. latirostris hatchlings. Eggs
   incubated at 31 degrees C produced 100% females, those at 32 degrees C
   produced 71.6% females (however, the sex ratio was nest related), and at
   33 degrees C produced 100% males. We found a masculinizing effect when
   incubation was at 31 +/- 2 degrees C compared with a constant 31 degrees
   C; and temperature fluctuations at 32 degrees C (32 +/- 1 and 32 +/- 2
   degrees C) had a negative effect on hatchlings size and mass, and
   hatching success compared with constant incubation temperatures of 32
   degrees C and 33 degrees C. Finally, the effect of temperature variation
   during the incubation period on sex ratio, hatching success, and
   phenotype depends on the mean temperature, as the fluctuation around 31
   degrees C affected the sex ratios and incubation period, and the
   fluctuation around 32 degrees C affected hatchling success and size.

   proportion of resources are used for reproduction. The present study
   summarizes for the first the key elements of the maturation of European
   smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) young of the year (YoY) in the North-eastern
   Gulf of Riga (the Baltic Sea). Prior to the changes in climatic
   conditions and collapse of smelt fishery in the 1990s in the Gulf of
   Riga, smelt attained sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years. We found a
   substantial share (22%) of YoY smelt with maturing gonads after the
   collapse of the smelt fisheries. Maturing individuals had a
   significantly higher weight, length and condition factor than immature
   YOY, indicating the importance of individual growth rates in the
   maturation process. The proportion of maturing YoY individuals increased
   with fish size. We discuss the factors behind prioritizing reproduction

AB Intertidal environments experience low salinity during heavy rainfall,
   creating stressful conditions for organisms, including invertebrate
   pelagic larvae, which can affect post-metamorphic development. Salinity
   in tide pools was monitored at low tide during a rainfall event in
   November 2013 at Puerto Montt, southern Chile. Water samples were taken
   to identify the presence and size of veligers of the gastropod
   Crepipatella peruviana. In addition, newly hatched veligers were exposed
   to different salinities [32 (control), 25, 20, and 15] in the laboratory
   for 6 h and then cultured at the control salinity until metamorphosis.
   Shell length (SL), oxygen consumption (OCR) and clearance (CR) rates of
   juveniles, and survival and growth in the first 2 weeks
   post-metamorphosis were quantified. The salinity of tide pools decreased
   to ten during heavy rains and yet contained an abundance of living
   veliger larvae; more than 85 % of the C. peruviana veligers collected
   had a SL <= 400 mu m, which implies that they had only recently hatched.
   Exposing early veligers to low salinities (15 and 20) decreased size at
   metamorphosis and early juvenile survival by approximately 10 and 20 %,
   respectively. Also, the CR was lower at 5 days post-metamorphosis,
   decreasing by 30 % in individuals that had been exposed to salinity 15
   as larvae. However, the OCR (5 and 15 days post-metamorphosis) and CR
   (15 days post-metamorphosis) were not different from the control
   treatment with an average value of 1.7 (x10(-2) mg O-2 h(-1) juv(-1))
   and 0.07 (L h(-1) juv(-1)) for OCR and CR at 15 days post-metamorphosis,
   respectively. Also there was no effect on juvenile growth rate. This
   study shows that short hyposaline events suffered by early veligers of
   C. peruviana can cause reduced size at metamorphosis and potentially
   reduce juvenile survival, factors that could affect the fitness of
   future adult populations.

AB Plant phenological records are crucial for predicting plant responses to
   global warming. However, many historical records are either short or
   replete with data gaps, which pose limitations and may lead to erroneous
   conclusions about the direction and magnitude of change. In addition to
   uninterrupted monitoring, missing observations may be substituted via
   modeling, experimentation, or gradient analysis. Here we have developed
   a space-for-time (SFT) substitution method that uses spatial phenology
   and temperature data to fill gaps in historical records. To do this, we
   combined historical data for several tree species from a single location
   with spatial data for the same species and used linear regression and
   Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to build complementary spring phenology
   models and assess improvements achieved by the approach. SFT
   substitution allowed increasing the sample size and developing more
   robust phenology models for some of the species studied. Testing models
   with reduced historical data size revealed thresholds at which SFT
   improved historical trend estimation. We conclude that under certain
   circumstances both the robustness of models and accuracy of phenological
   trends can be enhanced although some limitations and assumptions still
   need to be resolved. There is considerable potential for exploring SFT
   analyses in phenology studies, especially those conducted in urban

AB The Middle Pleistocene Transition (1.2-0.7 Ma) is the most recent
   re-organization of the global climate system which includes variations
   in the frequency and amplitude of glacial/interglacial cycles, increased
   ice sheet volume, sea surface temperature cooling and a significant drop
   in the CO2 atmospheric levels. Here we present high-resolution
   planktonic foraminifera data (mean sampling resolution of about 780
   years) from core LC10 recovered in the Ionian Sea (eastern
   Mediterranean), between 1.2 and 0.9 Ma.
   Selected taxa, among them G. ruber, T. quinqueloba and G. bulloides,
   show significant periodicities that can be associated to orbital cycles,
   mainly precession and obliquity. The planktonic foraminifera based
   paleoclimatic curve exhibits a cooling linear trend that can be
   associated to similar phenomena observed in the North Atlantic. On the
   other hand, we refer to the influence of the North African Monsoon the
   occurrence of two peaks of the low-salinity tolerant species G.
   quadrilobatus that fall in coincidence of sapropel layers. Finally, we
   discuss the distribution pattern of N. pachyderma sinistral coiling,
   with peaks up to about 20% between MIS 30 and 28, and compare it to
   middle-late Quaternary records of the Sicily Channel and western
   Mediterranean. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although adaptation of Drosophila to thermal extremes has been
   investigated for many years, only recently has much progress been made
   in identifying the genetic and physiological basis of evolutionary
   shifts in thermoresistance. Here we examine the way the Drosophila
   research has been used to understand the evolution of plastic responses,
   tradeoffs and limits to selection, and to develop links between
   laboratory studies and adaptive shifts leading to population and species
   differences.
   Several methods have been devised to rapidly measure heat and cold
   resistance, but the relevance of these-measures to selection pressures
   in nature remains largely unknown. Plastic responses to thermal extremes
   are usually. divided into short-term exposures to sub-lethal conditions
   or into longer-term exposures (often referred to as hardening and
   acclimation respectively). Hardening responses appear to have costs
   associated with the expression of a heat shock protein (Hsp70). Costs of
   acclimation are more difficult to identify because exposing Drosophila
   to suboptimal conditions for a long time can have deleterious effects
   unrelated to the acclimation response.
   Quantitative genetic analyses have revealed genetic variation for
   thermoresistance under laboratory conditions, but variation under
   natural conditions has rarely been identified. In a few cases selection
   responses within laboratory populations have been linked to specific
   candidate genes and physiological mechanisms.
   Population comparisons have provided evidence for clinal variation in
   thermoresistance traits, although many studies lack power because only a
   few populations have. been considered. Clinal patterns in candidate
   genes have also been demonstrated. However evidence for direct selection
   for thermoresistance and for the involvement of specific genes under
   natural conditions is mostly lacking. Clinal responses to-c old extremes
   can involve changes in diapause strategies and altered patterns of
   reproduction. Inbreeding influences thermoresistance and acclimation
   responses, but inbreeding effects may be environment-specific.
   Species differences in heat or in cold resistance commonly match the
   geographical (climatic) distributions of species. Interspecific
   differences, for heat resistance are usually smaller than for cold
   resistance. Drosophila species from the same location can differ
   markedly for stress resistance, and this may-allow-species to occupy
   different niches.
   Rapid progress is likely in the next few years in identifying genes and
   fraits-underlying variation in stress resistance among populations and
   species of Prosophila, and in comparing. these findings to those from
   other taxa. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Particle-tracking experiments were performed to infer the distribution
   of larvae of the Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) and to
   detect effects of transport environment on sardine recruitment, using
   the output of a high-resolution ocean general circulation model and
   observed data of sardine spawning grounds during 1978-2004. By the 60th
   day following spawning, approximately 50% of the larvae had been
   transported to the Kuroshio Extension (KE). Whereas the spawning period
   and grounds changed markedly in relation to the stock level, the
   proportion of larvae transported to the KE remained relatively constant
   and no significant correlations were found between sardine recruitment
   and the transport proportion. Instead, the recruitment was found to be
   correlated with physical parameters including the mixed layer depth and
   the sea surface temperature along several major transport trajectories
   of sardine larvae. The correlations were most significant for the
   trajectories in the region 0.5 degrees south to 1 degrees north of the
   Kuroshio axis (defined as the location of velocity maxima at each
   longitude) and for larvae spawned in February and March during the high
   stock period (1978-94), and for larvae spawned in March and April during
   the low stock period (1995-2004).

PD APR 2004
PY 2004
AB The simultaneous effects of selective agents acting on somatic growth
   rates, their interactions, and their interactions with local
   environmental conditions that vary across a species' geographic range
   are potentially complex and poorly known. This is particularly true of
   viviparous ectotherms whose offspring may be adapted to the gestation
   environment provided by their mothers. We studied multiple sources of
   growth rate variation in a widespread, viviparous reptile, including the
   effect of the maternal environment on growth following parturition.
   Females in early pregnancy were collected from replicate populations
   close to the tropical and temperate margins of this species' range.
   These females completed gestation in either of two different, common
   environments designed to simulate the thermal and photoperiod
   environments at the sampling locations. Our experiments revealed complex
   growth rate evolution between the northern and southern extremes of
   Eulamprus quoyii's geographic range and local adaptation of growth rates
   to maternal environments. Unique to this study was the manifestation of
   these growth rate differences, entrained in utero, but expressed
   following parturition and maintained through to maturity despite the
   presence of compensatory growth. In addition to providing the most
   complete picture to date of the evolution of somatic growth in a
   viviparous ectotherm, our study suggests that understanding local
   adaptation to maternal gestation environments, in terms of both mean
   growth rates and growth rate reaction norms, could change our
   understanding of how growth rates have evolved in other viviparous
   ectotherms. Indeed, such local adaptation may provide a selective
   advantage in the evolution of viviparity.

AB Subfossil biotic assemblages in lakes' surface sediments have been used
   to infer ecological conditions across environmental gradients. Local
   variables are usually the major drivers of assemblage composition, but
   in remote oceanic islands biogeographic filters may play a significant
   role. To assess the contribution of local and regional filters in the
   composition of subfossil diatom and chironomid assemblages in surface
   sediments, 41 lakes in Azores archipelago were studied and related to
   environmental variables. Ordination techniques were used to identify the
   forcing factors that best explain the composition of these assemblages.
   Both assemblages are influenced by multiple limnological variables
   (conductivity, pH and nutrients). However, diatom assemblages differed
   mainly in the proportion of planktonic versus benthic species along
   lakes' depth gradient while chironomids differed significantly among
   islands but not among lake depths. Thus, biogeographic filters play an
   important role in shaping islands' freshwater communities, particularly
   insect ones, more influenced by geographic variables. Results
   demonstrate the accuracy and potential of biotic remains in sediments
   for applied studies of lake ecology, trophic status, climatic trends and
   ecological reconstruction and evolution of lakes. In the Azores, the
   application of this information for the development of inference models
   is envisaged as a further step to accomplish these goals.

AB BACKGROUND: The present study was aimed at examining the effect of tuber
   mineral composition, distinctive for geographical location, on the
   expression of acrylamide precursors in three potato genotypes (Arinda,
   Rossa di Cetica and Sieglinde) in three Italian potato cultivation
   regions (Puglia, Sicily and Tuscany).
   RESULTS: Sucrose and amino acids were not correlated with acrylamide
   formation. In contrast, reducing sugars, limiting with respect to the
   principal amino acid precursor asparagine, were positively correlated
   with acrylamide. From analysis of variance, both acrylamide and reducing
   sugars were not significant for variety but highly significant for
   location, with higher levels occurring in all three varieties cultivated
   in Tuscany, followed by Sicily and Puglia respectively. Reducing sugars
   were negatively correlated with K and Ca and positively correlated with
   Zn and Cu. Neither N nor P was correlated with reducing sugar content.
   Path analysis, a statistical technique distinguishing causation and
   correlation between variables, was implemented to provide additional
   insight on the interactions between mineral elements and reducing sugars
   under open field conditions. The variation in reducing sugars in all
   three varieties was shown to be attributable to Zn.
   CONCLUSION: Cultivation location has a significant impact on the
   composition of tuber mineral elements and, as a result, on genotype in
   the expression of reducing sugars. The negative correlation between Zn
   and K and the variation in reducing sugar content attributed to the
   element Zn, which is particularly available in acid soils, are important
   factors warranting future research aimed at reducing acrylamide
   formation from an agronomic perspective. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical

AB P>Amphibian chytridiomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Whether Bd is a new emerging
   pathogen (the novel pathogen hypothesis; NPH) or whether environmental
   changes are exacerbating the host-pathogen dynamic (the endemic pathogen
   hypothesis; EPH) is debated. To disentangle these hypotheses we map the
   distribution of Bd and chytridiomycosis across the Iberian Peninsula
   centred on the first European outbreak site. We find that the
   infection-free state is the norm across both sample sites and
   individuals. To analyse this dataset, we use Bayesian zero-inflated
   binomial models to test whether environmental variables can account for
   heterogeneity in both the presence and prevalence of Bd, and
   heterogeneity in the occurrence of the disease, chytridiomycosis. We
   also search for signatures of Bd-spread within Iberia using genotyping.
   We show (1) no evidence for any relationship between the presence of Bd
   and environmental variables, (2) a weak relationship between
   environmental variables and the conditional prevalence of infection, (3)
   stage-dependent heterogeneity in the infection risk, (4) a strong
   association between altitude and chytridiomycosis, (5) multiple Iberian
   genotypes and (6) recent introduction and spread of a single genotype of
   Bd in the Pyrenees. We conclude that the NPH is consistent with the
   emergence of Bd in Iberia. However, epizootic forcing of infection is
   tied to location and shaped by both biotic and abiotic variables.
   Therefore, the population-level consequences of disease introduction are
   explained by EPH-like processes. This study demonstrates the power of
   combining surveillance and molecular data to ascertain the drivers of
   new emerging infections diseases.

AB Variation of dark pigmentation according to developmental temperature
   was investigated in two geographic populations (France and India) with
   the isofemale line technique (20 lines for each population). The
   response curves called the reaction norms, were established in females
   for seven different segments: the mesothorax and abdomen segments 2-7
   (Abd 2-7). In all cases the response curves were non-linear and had to
   be described either by a quadratic convex polynomial for thorax and Abd
   2-5, or by a cubic polynomial for Abd 6 and 7. Among abdomen segments,
   increasing antero-posterior gradients were observed for several traits,
   including average pigmentation, overall phenotypic plasticity, the
   temperature of minimum pigmentation, and the curvature parameter of
   quadratic norms. Genetic correlations between abdomen segments were high
   when adjacent segments were considered, but became nil when more distant
   segments were correlated, suggesting that different pigmentation genes
   are expressed in the anterior and the posterior part of the abdomen.
   Characteristic values of reaction norms provided information either on
   trait value (i.e., the extension of pigmentation) or on plasticity.
   Correlations between plasticity and pigmentation were generally low and
   non-significant, suggesting their genetic independence. The overall
   darker pigmentation which is observed at low temperatures is assumed to
   be an adaptive plasticity. However. the differences which are evidenced
   among segments reveal strong interactions with developmental genes.
   These interactions are less likely to be a consequence of natural
   selection and are better interpreted as developmental constraints. The
   reaction norms analysis reveals the complexity of these interactions and
   should help, in the future, in the identification of the responsible
   thermosensitive genes.

   examines whether the high genotypic diversity found in the Baltic cyst
   pool of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii is coupled to
   phenotypic variability that could aid short-term adaptation. Growth
   rates, cellular toxicities and bioluminescence of 34 genetically
   different clones isolated from cyst beds of four Baltic bloom sites were
   determined in batch culture experiments along temperature and salinity
   gradients covering present and future conditions in the Baltic Sea. For
   all parameters a significant effect of genotype on the response to
   temperature and salinity changes was identified. General or
   site-specific effects of the two factors remained minor. Clones thriving
   at future conditions were different from the best performing at present
   conditions, suggesting that genotypic shifts may be expected in the
   future. Increased proportions of highly potent saxitoxin were observed
   as a plastic response to temperature increase, indicating a potential
   for higher toxicity of future blooms. The observed standing variation in
   Baltic seed banks of A.ostenfeldii suggests that the population is
   likely to persist under environmental change.

   CAPS designated SCAFLP3, SCAFLP4 and SCAFLP5. By completing the mapping
   population up to 1,332 offspring from P.2175, Ma and SCAFLP2 were mapped
   in a 0.8 cM interval between SCAFLP3 and SCAFLP4. A large-insert
   bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA library of P.2175, totaling
   30,720 clones with a mean insert size of 145 kb and a 14-15x Prunus
   haploid genome coverage was constructed and used to land on the Ma
   spanning interval with few BAC clones. As P.2175 is heterozygous for the
   gene, we constructed the resistant and susceptible physical contigs by
   PCR screening of the library with codominant markers. Additional
   microsatellite markers were then designed from BAC subcloning or BAC end
   sequencing. In the resistant contig, a single 280 kb BAC clone was shown
   to carry the Ma gene; this BAC contains two flanking markers on each
   side of the gene as well as two cosegregating markers. These results
   should allow future cloning of the Ma gene in this perennial species.

AB The passive permeation of glucose and a small zwitterionic molecule,
   methyl-phosphoethanolamine, across two-component phospholipid bilayers
   (dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC)/dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine
   (DPPC) mixtures) exhibit a maximum when gel domains and fluid domains
   coexist. The permeability data of the two-phase bilayers cannot be
   fitted to single-rate kinetics, but are consistent with a Gaussian
   distribution of rate constants. In pure DMPC and DPPC as well as in
   their mixtures, at the temperature of the maximum excess heat capacity,
   the logarithm of the average permeability rate constants are linearly
   correlated with the mole fraction of DPPC in the total system. In
   addition, in the 50:50 mixture, the excess heat capacity values as well
   as the apparent fractions of interfacial lipid correlate with the
   logarithm of the excess permeabilities in the two-phase region. These
   results suggest that small polar molecules can cross the membrane at the
   interface between gel and fluid domains at a much faster rate than
   through the homogeneous phases; the acyl chains located at the domain
   interface experience lateral density fluctuations that are inversely
   proportional to their average length, and large enough to allow rapid
   transmembrane diffusion of the solute molecules. The distribution of the
   permeability rate constants may reflect temporal and spatial
   fluctuations of the lipid composition at the phase boundaries.

AB Increases in environmental temperature predicted to result from global
   warming have direct effects on performance of ectotherms. Moreover,
   cardiac function has been observed to limit the tolerance to high
   temperatures. Here we show that two wild populations of Atlantic salmon
   originating from northern and southern extremes of its European
   distribution have strikingly similar cardiac responses to acute warming
   when acclimated to common temperatures, despite different local
   environments. Although cardiac collapse starts at 21-23 degrees C with a
   maximum heart rate of similar to 150 beats per min (bpm) for 12 degrees
   C-acclimated fish, acclimation to 20 degrees C considerably raises this
   temperature (27.5 degrees C) and maximum heart rate (similar to 200
   bpm). Only minor population differences exist and these are consistent
   with the warmer habitat of the southern population. We demonstrate that
   the considerable cardiac plasticity discovered for Atlantic salmon is
   largely independent of natural habitat, and we propose that observed
   cardiac plasticity may aid salmon to cope with global warming.

AB In this study, we integrated ecological and palaeoecological
   perspectives to compare two approaches for tracing nutrient changes in
   lakes. Total phosphorus (TP) optima of chironomids (Diptera:
   Chironomidae) derived from a training set (i.e. calibration set)
   collected using the Chironomid Pupal Exuvial Technique (CPET) and by
   using surface sediment larval head capsule assemblages were compared and
   applied to infer long- term nutrient variability in eutrophic Lake
   Mallusjarvi, southern Finland. Overall, the chironomid- TP optima showed
   similarities between the training sets with the exception of
   Paracladopelma, Procladius and Chironomus plumosus whose optima were
   lower in the larval training set. As a result of this and due to the
   absence of Microchironomus tener in the CPET training set, there was a
   large difference in the magnitude of reconstructed change in the
   downcore profile of Lake Mallusjarvi as the CPET- method inferred
   significantly lower TP values for the past 200 years. Potential problems
   with the use of the CPET method in palaeolimnological research, include
   temporal representativeness of samples, taxonomic differences between
   pupal exuviae and larval head capsule identification and an unbalanced
   ratio between the preserving specimens (one exuviae and up to four
   fossil head capsules per one individual). Our results showed that the
   use of the training set developed from larval head capsules provided
   more reliable results from the downcore profile compared to the CPET
   training set, which in turn, is more suited to use in contemporary water
   quality assessments.

AB Climate-induced ocean warming and acidification may render marine
   organisms more vulnerable to infectious diseases. We investigated the
   effects of warming and acidification on the immune response of the sea
   urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Sea urchins were gradually introduced
   to four combinations of temperature and pH(NIST) (17 degrees C/pH 8.15,
   17 degrees C/pH 7.6, 23 degrees C /pH 8.15 and 23 degrees C/pH 7.6) and
   then held in temperature pH treatments for 1, 15 or 30 days to determine
   if the immune response would adjust to stressors over time. Coelomocyte
   concentration and type, phagocytic capacity and bactericidal activity
   were measured on day 1, 15 and 30 with different sea urchins used each
   time. At each time point, the coelomic fluid of individuals exposed to
   increased temperature and acidification had the lowest coelomocyte
   concentrations, exhibited lower phagocytic capacities and was least
   effective at inhibiting bacterial growth of the pathogen Vibrio
   anguillarum. Over time, increased temperature alleviated the negative
   effects of acidification on phagocytic activity. Our results demonstrate
   the importance of incorporating acclimation time to multiple stressors
   when assessing potential responses to future ocean conditions and
   indicate that the immune response of H. erythrogramma may be compromised
   under near-future ocean warming and acidification.

AB Population dynamics of small pelagic fishes (SPF) and their management
   in Japan were reviewed for Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus,
   Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus,
   and Pacific saury Cololabis saira. The catch and biomass of SPF
   generally showed decadal-scale variability with prominent species
   replacements since the 1900s. The causes of species replacements were
   generally associated with climatic/oceanic variability, particularly
   regime shifts, of which the 1988/89 regime shift was the most
   influential since the 1970s. Variability in the early survival rate is a
   key factor for population fluctuations, and the proposed hypothetical
   mechanisms of recruitment variability are summarized herein. Although
   overfishing during the 1990s and early 2000s prevented the recovery of
   Pacific stocks of sardine and chub mackerel, they have been recovering
   since the mid-2000s owing to strong year classes and reduced
   exploitation rates. The fundamental cause of overfishing was derived
   from a mismatch between investments in larger purse seine fleets during
   the 1980s and poor ocean productivity since the 1988/89 regime shift,
   when dominant SPF began to shift from sardine to anchovy.
   Recommendations for fisheries management of SPF around the Japanese
   Archipelago are proposed, considering climate change and naturally and
   drastically changing SPF populations.

AB The thermal environment and length of the activity season are important
   factors in shaping life-history trait variation in ectotherms. Many
   ectothermic vertebrates living at high latitudes or altitudes tend to be
   larger and older than their conspecifics living at lower latitudes or
   altitudes. However, detailed data on age, body size and growth
   variation-and how they may differ between males and females-are still
   scarce, especially from extreme high-latitude environments. We studied
   growth (body length increment), age and size structure of common frogs
   (Rana temporaria) in subarctic Finland (69A degrees 04'N) by applying
   skeletochronological methods to individually marked adults (n = 169)
   captured and recaptured between 1999 and 2003. We found that breeding
   males were on average younger (mean = 8.5 years) than females (11.9
   years) and that males started reproducing earlier (a parts per thousand
   yen3-4 years of age) than females (> 4-5 years). The oldest encountered
   individual was an 18-year-old female, which to our knowledge is the
   oldest wild common frog ever reported. Females were on average larger
   (mean body length = 76.6 mm) than males (70.7 mm), and this appeared to
   be mainly due to their older age as compared to males. While body length
   increased and growth rate decreased with age in both sexes, growth rate
   declined significantly faster with age in males than in females. The
   latter finding provides a proximate explanation for the observation that
   even after accounting for age differences among sexes (females > males),
   females were longer than males.

AB Given predicted rapid climate change, an understanding of how
   environmental factors affect genetic diversity in natural populations is
   important. Future selection pressures are inherently unpredictable, so
   forest management policies should maintain both overall diversity and
   identify genetic markers associated with the environmental factors
   expected to change most rapidly, like temperature and rainfall. In this
   study, we genotyped 648 individuals in 28 populations of Castanopsis
   fargesii (Fagaceae) using 32 expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived
   microsatellite markers. After removing six loci that departed from
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we measured genetic variation, population
   structure and identified candidate loci putatively under selection by
   temperature and precipitation. We found that C. fargesii populations
   possessed high genetic diversity and moderate differentiation among
   them, indicating predominant outcrossing and few restrictions to gene
   flow. These patterns reduce the possible impact of stochastic effects or
   the influence of genetic isolation. Clear footprints of divergent
   selection at four loci were discovered. Frequencies of five alleles at
   these loci were strongly correlated with environmental factors,
   particularly extremes in precipitation. These alleles varied from being
   near fixation at one end of the gradient to being completely absent at
   the other. Our study species is an important forest tree in the
   subtropical regions of China and could have a major role in future
   management and reforestation plans. Our results demonstrate that the
   gene flow is widespread and abundant in natural populations, maintaining
   high diversity, while diversifying selection is acting on specific
   genomic regions.

AB Plant functional traits can be genetically determined or phenotypically
   plastic. We assessed the degree of genetic determinism in the functional
   traits of Andean Polylepis tree species among 14 important traits that
   enable the species to withstand cold and dry conditions. We conducted a
   common garden experiment and related the species-specific means of the
   functional traits to the variables of climatic niche optima of the
   species (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation), deducing
   that if the interspecific variation in the functional trait is related
   to the species climatic niche optima according to the
   theoretically-expected pattern of climate-trait relationship, the
   variation of the trait must be genetically determined. In general, the
   traits were related either to species temperature or precipitation
   optima. For example, leaf size, maximum photosynthesis rate and root tip
   abundance were related to temperature, whereas light compensation and
   light saturation points were related to precipitation. Only leaf size
   showed a significant phylogenetic signal, indicating that most of the
   manifested climate-trait relationships are not caused purely by
   phylogeny, but are mainly a result of species specialisation along an
   environmental gradient. However, in many cases the relationships were
   rather weak. This suggests that important functional traits of Polylepis
   species involve both genetic and phenotypic components aiming to
   maximise the overall fitness of the species at high elevations.

AB Precipitation is one of the most critical inputs for models used to
   improve understanding of hydrological processes. In high mountain areas,
   it is challenging to generate a reliable precipitation data set
   capturing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the harsh
   climate, extreme terrain and the lack of observations. This study
   conducts intensive observation of precipitation in the Mabengnong
   catchment in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau during July to August
   2013. Because precipitation is greatly influenced by altitude, the
   observed data are used to characterize the precipitation gradient (PG)
   and hourly distribution (HD), showing that the average PG is 0.10, 0.28
   and 0.26 mm/d/100 m and the average duration is around 0.1, 0.8 and 5.2
   h for trace, light and moderate rain, respectively. A distributed
   biosphere hydrological model based on water and energy budgets with
   improved physical process for snow (WEB-DHMS) is applied to simulate the
   hydrological processes with gridded precipitation data derived from a
   lower altitude meteorological station and the PG and HD characterized
   for the study area. The observed runoff, MODIS/Terra snow cover area
   (SCA) data, and MODIS/Terra land surface temperature (LST) data are used
   for model calibration and validation. Runoff, SCA and LST simulations
   all show reasonable results. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that runoff
   is largely underestimated without considering PG, indicating that
   short-term intensive precipitation observation has the potential to
   greatly improve hydrological modelling of poorly gauged high mountain
   catchments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sprat, Sprattus sprattus, is a small pelagic fish species with a wide
   distribution along the European continental shelf, the Mediterranean
   Sea, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the coldest
   area of the species distribution range. Even here, sprat is still
   numerous and holds a key role in the ecosystem. However, the population
   is sensitive to small changes in environmental conditions. In this
   paper, we set up a bioenergetic model of Baltic sprat and evaluate how
   variability and seasonal changes in the physical environment affects the
   physiology and growth of individual sprat. The model is dynamic and
   seasonally resolved. It is parameterised based on sprat from the
   Bornholm Basin. Our model results suggest that the optimal temperature
   for sprat growth is 17.5 degrees C, which is only observed in the
   Central Baltic Sea in the top water layer during a short period in
   summer. During 4 1/2 winter months individual sprat do not grow and
   utilize stored energy from the previous growth season. We analysed the
   maximum attainable individual body size as a function of temperature.
   The model predicted reduced maximum body sizes with increasing
   temperature. The model can be used for studying climate change scenarios
   on individual growth, egg production and condition of Baltic sprat. (C)

AB Fabry disease is a progressive disease characterized by an enzymatic
   deficiency of acid alpha-galactosidase and glycosphingolipids storage
   within the lysosomes. The disease has two phenotypes: classic and
   nonclassic. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common sign reported by
   patients and can be caused by a circadian rhythm sleep disorder.
   Activity and rest cycle, variation of body temperature and melatonin
   biosynthesis are known rhythmicity markers. In the face of these
   evidences, our goal was to evaluate the rhythmic profile in Fabry's
   disease patients using rhythmicity markers. For this purpose, we
   recruited 17 patients diagnosed with Fabry disease (11 classic and 6
   nonclassic variant) that answered the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the
   Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire adapted from Horne and Ostberg;
   recorded activity and body temperature rhythms by an actigraphy during
   at least 10 days and collected urine to assess 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
   excretion load during the day (from the second urine in the morning
   until 7 p.m.) and night (starting from 7 p.m. until the first urine in
   the morning of the following day). We observed that control subjects
   presented higher excretion load of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin during the night
   (p < 0.05, d = 7.8), as expected. Patients with the nonclassic variant
   presented an inversion on 6-sulfatoxymelatonin daily profile (p < 0.05,
   d = 3.8) and there was no difference between the day and night profile
   of classic variant patients when compared to the other two groups.
   Patients with the classic variant also presented temperature period
   greater than 24 hours (p < 0.05, d = 2.0). Therefore, we came to the
   conclusion that there is an alteration in the circadian rhythms in Fabry

AB Contemporary evolution of thermal physiology has the potential to help
   limit the physiological stress associated with rapidly changing thermal
   environments; however it is unclear if wild populations can respond
   quickly enough for such changes to be effective. We used native Canadian
   Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) sunfish, and non-native Pumpkinseed
   introduced into the milder climate of Spain 100 years ago, to assess
   genetic differences in thermal physiology in response to the warmer
   non-native climate. We compared temperature performance reaction norms
   of two Canadian and two Spanish Pumpkinseed populations born and raised
   within a common environment. We found that Canadian Pumpkinseed had
   higher routine metabolic rates when measured at seasonally high
   temperatures (15 degrees C in winter, 30 degrees C in summer), and that
   Spanish Pumpkinseed had higher critical thermal maxima when acclimated
   to 30 degrees C in the summer. Growth rates were not significantly
   different among populations, however Canadian Pumpkinseed tended to have
   faster growth at the warmest temperatures measured (32 degrees C). The
   observed differences in physiology among Canadian and Spanish
   populations at the warmest acclimation temperatures are consistent with
   the introduced populations being better suited to the warmer non-native
   climate than native populations. The observed differences could be the
   result of either founder effects, genetic drift, and/or contemporary
   adaptive evolution in the warmer nonnative climate.

AB One of the main functions of infrared thermography (IRT) consists in
   detecting temperature changes in organisms caused by variations in
   surface blood circulation. IRT is a useful tool that has been used
   mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies,
   though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the
   block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology,
   IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology,
   changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic
   activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to
   complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients
   in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used
   as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures
   in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental
   implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with
   bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence
   of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree
   of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary
   medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms
   of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures. The aim of
   this review is to evaluate how IRT can be used as a tool in surgical
   procedures, cases of vascular change, and pain monitoring in veterinary
   medicine with an emphasis on small animals.

AB A morphometric study of Coccolithus pelagicus s. l. coccoliths was
   performed on 98 samples from a long sediment core recovered off the
   Portuguese margin (MD95-2040) and 29 more surface samples from an
   extensive area of the North Atlantic. The core allowed following in
   detail morphometric changes of this species through the last two glacial
   cycles while surface samples were used to analyse biogeographic
   distribution of the morphotypes. The main purpose of the present work is
   to identify and characterize the existence of distinct morphotypes of
   the species Coccolithus pelagicus s.l. and test the presence of its two
   extant subspecies (C. pelagicus pelagicus and C. pelagicus braarudii) in
   the studied area. For each sample maximum placolith diameters of one
   hundred randomly selected specimens were tabulated into 1 mum morphons.
   The behaviour of these morphons, characterized by R-mode Factor
   Analysis, allows defining morphotypes as groups of highly correlated
   morphons.
   Surface sample data set showed the existence of three morphotypes: a
   small (7-10mum), an intermediate (11-13mum), and a large morphotype
   (15-16mum). The factor scores distribution shows that at present day,
   the smallest morphotype mainly occurs above 60degreesN, the intermediate
   is predominant in the West coast of Iberia, whereas the largest one
   tends to Occur in areas surrounding the Azores region.
   Data from MD95-2040 also allowed the identification of three
   morphotypes: a small (6-9mum), an intermediate (10-13mum) and a large
   (14-15mum) morphotype. The small morphotype shows significant
   similarities to the records of the two independent proxies for the
   periodic influence of cold waters off Iberia, the abundances of
   left-coiling N. pachyderma and ice-rafted detritus (IRD). These confirm
   its positive response to subpolar influxes off western Iberia, its
   direct relationship to C pelagicus pelagicus and thus its future use as
   a proxy for cold waters. The intermediate morphotype is related to C.
   pelagicus braarudii and to the upwelling conditions off Iberia while the
   predominance of a larger morphotype (here described as C. pelagicus
   azorinus) in the Azores region may allow its future use as a proxy of
   the influence of the Azores current in Eastern North Atlantic.

AB Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and crystal krill (Euphausia
   crystallorophias), important components of the Ross Sea food web, differ
   in their population distribution. The objective of this study was to
   determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from
   differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and
   transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective,
   Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the
   transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle
   simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to
   the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport
   and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf.
   Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high
   retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with
   timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These
   results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes
   significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts
   of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with
   high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward
   circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and
   aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water
   is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break.
   The transport pathways and connectivity obtained from this study provide
   a baseline for assessing the effects of projected changes in the Ross
   Sea circulation on the distribution of two important krill species.

AB The patterns and drivers of late Quaternary vegetation dynamics in the

   density, problematic chronologies, and a paucity of independent
   paleoclimate proxy records. We present a well-dated (15 accelerator mass
   spectrometry C-14 dates) 30,000-yr record from White Pond, South
   Carolina that consists of high-resolution analyses of fossil pollen,
   macroscopic charcoal, and Sporormiella spores, and an independent
   paleotemperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl
   tetraethers. Between 30,000 and 20,000 cal yr BP, open Pinus-Picea
   forest grew under cold and dry conditions; elevated Quercus before
   26,000 cal yr BP, however, suggest warmer conditions in the Southeast
   before the last glacial maximum, possibly corresponding to regionally
   warmer conditions associated with Heinrich event H2. Warming between
   19,700 and 10,400 cal yr BP was accompanied by a transition from
   conifer-dominated to mesic hardwood forest. Sporormiella spores were not
   detected and charcoal was low during the late glacial period, suggesting
   megaherbivore grazers and fire were not locally important agents of
   vegetation change. Pinus returned to dominance during the Holocene, with
   step-like increases in Pinus at 10,400 and 6400 cal yr BP, while
   charcoal abundance increased tenfold, likely due to increased biomass
   burning associated with warmer conditions. Low-intensity surface fires
   increased after 1200 cal yr BP, possibly related to the establishment of
   the Mississippian culture in the Southeast.

   of 16:8 (L.D) h. H. armigera reared at constant temperatures did not
   develop from egg to adult (emergence) outside the temperature range of
   17.5-32.5 degrees C. The alternating conditions expanded this range from
   10 to 35 degrees C. The lowest developmental thresholds of the immature
   stages were estimated by a linear model and ranged from 10.17 (pupal
   stage) to 11.95 degrees C (egg stage) at constant temperature regimes
   and from 1.1 to 5.5 degrees C, respectively at alternating temperatures.
   The values of developmental thresholds estimated using the nonlinear
   (Lactin-2) model were lower than those estimated by the linear model for
   constant and alternating temperature regimes except for larval and pupal
   stages at constant temperatures. Mean adult longevity fluctuated from
   34.4 d at 15 degrees C to 7.6 d at 35 degrees C. Females reared under
   all alternating temperature regimes laid more eggs than females reared
   at any, except the 25 degrees C, constant temperature treatment. The
   intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 27.5 degrees C, at both the
   constant and the corresponding alternating temperature regimes (0.147
   and 0.139, respectively). Extreme temperatures had a negative effect on
   life table parameters.

AB AimCommon ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is a medically relevant
   invasive species of great public interest due to its highly allergenic
   pollen. We aimed at modelling its potential range, its net primary
   production (NPP) and important phenological stages.
   LocationEurope and North America.
   MethodsWe developed a new physiological model for common ragweed and
   applied it to simulate the species potential distribution (calibrated
   with the native range), NPP and phenology in North America and Europe.
   Based on this model, we investigated which regions are suitable for
   ragweed growth in Europe and simulated the timing of phenological stages
   that determine pollen release.
   ResultsThe model predicted the observed distribution of ragweed in North
   America well. The application to Europe suggests that large parts of
   Europe are climatically suitable for ragweed growth and reproduction.
   The highest potential NPP was predicted in southern-central and
   south-eastern Europe and southern France, roughly corresponding with
   hotspots of atmospheric pollen load, but also indicating a higher
   potential than currently achieved in western Europe and along parts of
   the northern edge of its distribution. The predicted time of pollen
   releases in Europe corresponded well with measurements from pollen
   traps.
   Main conclusionsThe results suggest that our mechanistic model
   adequately represents physiological and ecological characteristics that
   determine the potential distribution, productivity and phenology of
   common ragweed. The model could be used for predicting the potential
   distribution and performance of ragweed in the future under climate
   change and might thus contribute to improved longer term predictions of
   exposure to allergenic pollen.

AB The present study examines the mechanisms for the connection between the
   precipitation variability in eastern Brazil and the South Atlantic
   convergence zone (SACZ) convective margin (eastern Brazil/SACZ
   convective margin) and the variability of low-level inflow on
   interannual time scales during austral summer. The authors' methodology
   is based on the analysis of observational datasets and simulations by
   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) atmospheric general
   circulation model (AGCM) coupled to the Simplified Simple Biosphere
   Model.
   It is demonstrated that the inflow variability is associated with the
   leading mode of wind variability over subtropical South America, and the
   connection is established through the mechanism of an analytic prototype
   for convective margin shifts proposed in previous studies. Over the
   eastern Brazil/SACZ convective margin, the weaker (stronger) convection
   tends to occur together with stronger (weaker) low-level inflows in
   reference to the mean easterly trades. By changing the "ventilation"
   effect, stronger (weaker) inflows with low moist static energy from the
   Atlantic Ocean suppress (promote) convection. The causal relationship is
   verified by AGCM mechanism-testing experiments performed in
   perpetual-February mode, in which low-level, nondivergent wind
   perturbations are imposed in a region overlapping eastern Brazil and the
   western Atlantic Ocean. With solely the imposed-wind perturbations
   acting on the moisture advection in the model equation, the AGCM can
   reproduce the precipitation variability in the eastern Brazil/SACZ
   convective margin. The capability of the AGCM in capturing such
   precipitation sensitivity to the low-level inflow variability also
   suggests that the mechanism can be applied to other regions of
   convective margins or to other time scales.

AB This study aims to describe a new nonparametric ecological niche model
   for the analysis of presence-only data, which we use to map the spatial
   distribution of Atlantic cod and to project the potential impact of
   climate change on this species. The new model, called the Non-Parametric
   Probabilistic Ecological Niche (NPPEN) model, is derived from a test
   recently applied to compare the ecological niche of 2 different species.
   The analysis is based on a simplification of the Multiple Response
   Permutation Procedures (MRPP) using the Generalised Mahalanobis
   distance. For the first time, we propose to test the generalized
   Mahalanobis distance by a non-parametric procedure, thus avoiding the
   arbitrary selection of quantile classes to allow the direct estimation
   of the probability of occurrence of a species. The model NPPEN was
   applied to model the ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson) of Atlantic cod
   and therefore its spatial distribution. The modelled niche exhibited
   high probabilities of occurrence at bathymetry ranging from 0 to 500 m
   (mode from 100 to 300 m), at annual sea surface temperature of from -1
   to 14 degrees C (mode from 4 to 8 degrees C) and at annual sea surface
   salinity ranging from 0 to 36 (mode from 25 to 34). This made the
   species a good indicator of the sub-arctic province. Current climate
   change is having a strong effect on North Sea cod and may have also
   reinforced the negative impact of fishing on stocks located offshore of
   North America. The model shows a pronounced effect of present-day
   climate change on the spatial distribution of Atlantic cod. Projections
   for the coming decades suggest that cod may eventually disappear as a
   commercial species from regions where a sustained decrease or collapse
   has already been documented. In contrast, the abundance of cod is likely
   to increase in the Barents Sea.

AB Climate-induced ocean warming may have significant influences on
   abundance and geographic distribution of fish species and cause range
   shifts and/or expansions in their habitats. The jumbo flying squid
   Dosidicus gigas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean is an ecologically and
   commercially important species. With 1-year short lifespan, D. gigas is
   significantly affected by climatic and environmental variability. This
   study used the logbook data of the 2011-2015 Chinese squid-jigging
   fishery off Peruvian waters, coupled with sea surface temperature (SST)
   data, to explore the variations in seasonal habitat suitability and
   habitat distribution pattern for D. gigas in the Southeast Pacific Ocean
   under five scenarios: SST in recent years (2011-2015) and with 0.5
   degrees C, 1.0 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C and 4.0*C increases in relation
   to the climate variability. A fishing effort-based habitat suitability
   index (HSI) model was developed to estimate habitat quality of D. gigas
   and spatial distribution of suitable and optimal habitats in relation to
   ocean warming. Results indicated that obvious seasonal variations were
   observed in the SST on the fishing ground of D. gigas with spatial
   variability. HSI modeling approach in this study essentially captured
   habitat characteristics of D. gigas from spring to winter during
   2011-2015. SST increase scenarios revealed that seasonal habitat
   suitability of D. gigas significantly reduced, and the percentages of
   suitable (HSI >= 0.6) and optimal (HSI >= 0.8) habitats occupying the
   fishing ground dramatically decreased due to the rising SST. Moreover,
   an obvious southeastward movement was observed in gravity centers of D.
   gigas habitat under the above-mentioned five scenarios. Our findings
   suggested that ocean warming was likely to result in the shrinkage and
   southeastward range-shift in the potential high-quality habitats of D.
   gigas in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Peruvian waters.

   NHS Board areas. Monthly counts of viral and non-viral gastrointestinal
   infections were modelled as a smooth function of temperature, relative
   humidity and average monthly counts of faecal indicator organisms,
   respectively, adjusting for season and long-term trend effects. Strong
   seasonal patterns were observed for each group of pathogens. Peak viral
   gastrointestinal infection was in May while that of non-viral
   gastrointestinal infections was in July. A statistically significant
   negative association existed between weather (temperature and humidity)
   and viral infection. Average levels of non-viral gastrointestinal
   infections increased as temperature and relative humidity increased.
   Increasing levels of faecal indicator organisms in bathing waters were
   also associated with an increase in the average number of viral and

AB Phenotypic traits such as ornaments and armaments are generally shaped
   by sexual selection, which often favours larger and more elaborate males
   compared to females. But can sexual selection also influence the brain?
   Previous studies in vertebrates report contradictory results with no
   consistent pattern between variation in brain structure and the strength
   of sexual selection. We hypothesize that sexual selection will act in a
   consistent way on two vertebrate brain regions that directly regulate
   sexual behaviour: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPON) and the
   ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). The MPON regulates male
   reproductive behaviour whereas the VMN regulates female reproductive
   behaviour and is also involved in male aggression. To test our
   hypothesis, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined
   with traditional histology of brains in 14 dragon lizard species of the
   genus Ctenophorus that vary in the strength of precopulatory sexual
   selection. Males belonging to species that experience greater sexual
   selection had a larger MPON and a smaller VMN. Conversely, females did
   not show any patterns of variation in these brain regions. As the
   volumes of both these regions also correlated with brain volume (BV) in
   our models, we tested whether they show the same pattern of evolution in
   response to changes in BV and found that the do. Therefore, we show that
   the primary brain nuclei underlying reproductive behaviour in
   vertebrates can evolve in a mosaic fashion, differently between males
   and females, likely in response to sexual selection, and that these same
   regions are simultaneously evolving in concert in relation to overall
   brain size.

AB Blood from 1209 individual cod was sampled from nine localities in the
   Northeast Atlantic, and analysed using agar gel electrophoresis (AGE)
   and isoelectric focusing (IEF) to reveal individual and population
   variation in haemoglobin genotypes. The second aim of the study was to
   compare our data with data collected some 30 years ago in the same area
   to investigate possible directional selection. A new haemoglobin
   polymorphism of Atlantic cod was documented in samples from Danish
   waters using IEF electrophoresis (pH 5.5-8.5) and, in addition to the
   five genotypes seen in earlier studies, 11 subtypes are described.
   Significantly different genotype distributions were found between the
   samples from northern Norway on the one hand and southern Norway and
   Danish waters on the other, and the frequency of the Hb-1(1) allele
   increased from north to south. With the possible exception of two
   samples, the frequency of the main haemoglobin genotypes was found to be
   very similar to corresponding frequencies described in these areas three
   decades ago. The frequencies of the Hb-1 subtypes off Norway varied
   among the sampling sites and were only found in Norwegian coastal cod
   with increasing frequency from north to south. In the Danish samples, 11
   novel Hb-1 subtypes were found and are described.

AB Environmental fluctuations are important for parasite spread and
   persistence. However, the effects of the spatial and temporal structure
   of environmental fluctuations on host-parasite dynamics are not well
   understood. Temporal fluctuations can be random but positively
   autocorrelated, such that the environment is similar to the recent past
   (red noise), or random and uncorrelated with the past (white noise). We
   imposed red or white temporal temperature fluctuations on experimental
   metapopulations of Paramecium caudatum, experiencing an epidemic of the
   bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Metapopulations (two
   subpopulations linked by migration) experienced fluctuations between
   stressful (5 degrees C) and permissive (23 degrees C) conditions
   following red or white temporal sequences. Spatial variation in
   temperature fluctuations was implemented by exposing subpopulations to
   the same (synchronous temperatures) or different (asynchronous
   temperatures) temporal sequences. Red noise, compared with white noise,
   enhanced parasite persistence. Despite this, red noise coupled with
   asynchronous temperatures allowed infected host populations to maintain
   sizes equivalent to uninfected populations. It is likely that this
   occurs because subpopulations in permissive conditions rescue declining
   subpopulations in stressful conditions. We show how patterns of temporal
   and spatial environmental fluctuations can impact parasite spread and
   host population abundance. We conclude that accurate prediction of
   parasite epidemics may require realistic models of environmental noise.

AB Basal or standard metabolic rate reflects the minimum amount of energy
   required to maintain body processes, while the maximum metabolic rate
   sets the ceiling for aerobic work. There is typically up to three-fold
   intraspecific variation in both minimal and maximal rates of metabolism,
   even after controlling for size, sex and age; these differences are
   consistent over time within a given context, but both minimal and
   maximal metabolic rates are plastic and can vary in response to changing
   environments. Here we explore the causes of intraspecific and phenotypic
   variation at the organ, tissue and mitochondrial levels. We highlight
   the growing evidence that individuals differ predictably in the
   flexibility of their metabolic rates and in the extent to which they can
   suppress minimal metabolism when food is limiting but increase the
   capacity for aerobic metabolism when a high work rate is beneficial. It
   is unclear why this intraspecific variation in metabolic flexibility
   persists-possibly because of trade-offs with the flexibility of other
   traits-but it has consequences for the ability of populations to respond
   to a changing world. It is clear that metabolic rates are targets of
   selection, but more research is needed on the fitness consequences of
   rates of metabolism and their plasticity at different life stages,
   especially in natural conditions.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in
   phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

AB Algal symbionts (zooxanthellae, genus Symbiodinium) of scleractinian
   corals respond strongly to temperature, nutrient and light changes.
   These factors vary greatly along the north-south gradient in the Red Sea
   and include conditions, which are outside of those typically considered
   optimal for coral growth. Nevertheless, coral communities thrive
   throughout the Red Sea, suggesting that zooxanthellae have successfully
   acclimatized or adapted to the harsh conditions they experience
   particularly in the south (high temperatures and high nutrient supply).
   As such, the Red Sea is a region, which may help to better understand
   how zooxanthellae and their coral hosts successfully acclimatize or
   adapt to environmental change (e. g. increased temperatures and
   localized eutrophication). To gain further insight into the physiology
   of coral symbionts in the Red Sea, we examined the abundance of dominant
   Symbiodinium types associated with the coral Pocillopora verrucosa, and
   measured Symbiodinium physiological characteristics (i.e. photosynthetic
   processes, cell density, pigmentation, and protein composition) along
   the latitudinal gradient of the Red Sea in summer and winter. Despite
   the strong environmental gradients from north to south, our results
   demonstrate that Symbiodinium microadriaticum (type A1) was the
   predominant species in P. verrucosa along the latitudinal gradient.
   Furthermore, measured physiological characteristics were found to vary
   more with prevailing seasonal environmental conditions than with
   region-specific differences, although the measured environmental
   parameters displayed much higher spatial than temporal variability. We
   conclude that our findings might present the result of long-term
   acclimatization or adaptation of S. microadriaticum to regionally
   specific conditions within the Red Sea. Of additional note, high
   nutrients in the South correlated with high zooxanthellae density
   indicating a compensation for a temperature-driven loss of
   photosynthetic performance, which may prove promising for the resilience
   of these corals under increase of temperature increase and
   eutrophication.

AB Otolith microstructure of juvenile herring was used to distinguish
   autumn- and winter-spawned fish collected in the Celtic and Irish Seas
   in 1999 and 2000. Juveniles showed two distinct patterns of larval
   otolith growth; widely spaced increments (fast growers) and tightly
   packed increments (slow growers). Fast- and slow-growing fish exhibited
   a clear bimodal distribution and the two groups were completely distinct
   at increments 60-70. Otolith increment counts confirmed that the
   fast-growing fish originated from the winter spawning season and that
   slow-growing fish were spawned in autumn. This characteristic pattern of
   otolith growth was used to determine the relative proportions of autumn-
   and winter-spawned fish at nursery grounds in the Irish and Celtic Seas.
   Although the proportions in each area varied between years, nursery
   grounds in the western Irish Sea were generally dominated by
   winter-spawned fish whereas autumn-spawned fish were mostly at eastern
   stations. Given the distribution of spawning adults in the region, the
   vast majority of winter-spawned fish are likely to originate from the
   Celtic Sea. Larval growth differences between nursery areas suggest that
   Celtic Sea herring drift into the Irish Sea during the larval phase.
   There was significant variation in fish size between nursery areas for
   both autumn- and winter-spawned fish. Juvenile length was greatest in
   the Celtic Sea, intermediate in the eastern Irish Sea, and lowest in the
   western Irish Sea. Therefore, larval dispersal of Celtic Sea herring
   into the Irish Sea produces components in the surviving juvenile
   population with characteristic growth patterns. This population
   segregation could potentially impact on subsequent growth, survival and
   recruitment. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the

AB Modeling protein flexibility constitutes a major challenge in accurate
   prediction of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions in docking
   simulations. The lack of a reliable method for predicting the
   conformational changes relevant to substrate binding prevents the
   productive application of computational docking to proteins that undergo
   large structural rearrangements. Here, we examine how coarse-grained
   normal mode analysis has been advantageously applied to modeling protein
   flexibility associated with ligand binding. First, we highlight recent
   studies that have shown that there is a close agreement between the
   large-scale collective motions of proteins predicted by elastic network
   models and the structural changes experimentally observed upon ligand
   binding. Then, we discuss studies that have exploited the predicted soft
   modes in docking simulations. Two general strategies are noted:
   pregeneration of conformational ensembles that are then utilized as
   input for standard fixed-backbone docking and protein structure
   deformation along normal modes concurrent to docking. These studies show
   that the structural changes apparently "induced" upon ligand binding
   occur selectively along the soft modes accessible to the protein prior
   to ligand binding. They further suggest that proteins offer suitable
   means of accommodating/facilitating the recognition and binding of their
   ligand, presumably acquired by evolutionary selection of the suitable
   three-dimensional structure.

AB Background: Inbreeding is often associated with a decrease in offspring
   fitness ('inbreeding depression'). Moreover, it is generally assumed
   that the negative effects of inbreeding are exacerbated in stressful
   environments. This G x E interaction has been explored in many taxa
   under different environmental conditions. These studies usually
   manipulate environmental conditions either in adulthood or throughout an
   individual's entire life. Far fewer studies have tested how stressful
   environments only experienced during development subsequently influence
   the effects of inbreeding on adult traits.
   Results: We experimentally manipulated the diet (control versus low
   food) of inbred and outbred juvenile Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia
   holbrooki) for three weeks (days 7-28) to test whether experiencing a
   presumably stressful environment early in life influences their
   subsequent growth and adult phenotypes. The control diet was a standard
   laboratory food regime, while fish on the low food diet received less
   than 25 % of this amount of food. Unexpectedly, despite a large sample
   size (237 families, 908 offspring) and a quantified 23 % reduction in
   genome-wide heterozygosity in inbred offspring from matings between
   full-siblings (f = 0.25), neither inbreeding nor its interaction with
   early diet affected growth trajectories, juvenile survival or adult
   size. Individuals did not mitigate a poor start in life by showing
   'compensatory growth' (i.e. faster growth once the low food treatment
   ended), but they showed 'catch-up growth' by delaying maturation. There
   was, however, no effect of inbreeding on the extent of catch-up growth.
   Conclusions: There were no detectable effects of inbreeding on growth or
   adult size, even on a low food diet that should elevate inbreeding
   depression. Thus, the long-term costs of inbreeding due to lower male
   reproductive success we have shown in another study appear to be
   unrelated to inbreeding depression for adult male size or the growth
   rates that are reported in the current study.

AB The effects of hydrolysis of ATP-actin to ADP-actin on actin
   polymerization-based force generation are calculated using a
   multifilament two-state Brownian ratchet model. The model treats an
   ensemble of rigid parallel filaments growing against a hard, inert,
   diffusing obstacle held in an optical trap. The filaments stochastically
   grow, depolymerize and undergo transitions between polymerizing and
   depolymerizing tip states. The parameters in the model are obtained from
   literature values and a fit to the measured dependence of the
   polymerization rate on the free-actin concentration. For more than two
   filaments, the stall force per filament near the critical concentration
   is much less than the equilibrium ATP-actin stall force. By reducing the
   availability of free monomers, the obstacle causes filament tips to
   convert to the depolymerizing state, so that only a small fraction of
   the filaments contact the obstacle at a given time.

AB It is known that stem CO2 efflux differs somewhat both temporally and
   spatially from actual stem respiration, but relations between these two
   are not fully understood. A physical model of CO2 diffusion and
   advection by xylem sap flow is developed to interpret the CO2 flux
   signal from the stem. Model predictions are compared against measured
   CO2 efflux data from a field-grown 16-m Pinus sylvestris L. tree. The
   ratio of CO2 efflux to CO2 production is predicted to be much larger in
   the upper part of the tree than in the lower part as the xylem sap
   carries the respired CO2 upwards. The model also predicts the
   temperature dependency of real respiration to be higher than that of the
   CO2 efflux due to the slowness of diffusion. The relation between stem
   respiration and CO2 efflux depends strongly on the sap flow rate, radial
   diffusion resistance and stem geometry and size. The model may be used
   to scale individual CO2 efflux measurements to evaluate the respiration
   rate of whole trees and forests.

AB Seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod are important
   environmental cues used by small birds to adjust their body mass (M-b)
   and thermogenesis. However, the relative importance of these cues with
   respect to seasonal adjustments in M-b and thermogenesis is difficult to
   distinguish. In particular, the effects of temperature and photoperiod
   on energy metabolism and thermoregulation are not well known in many
   passerines. To address this problem, we measured the effects of
   temperature and photoperiod on M-b, energy intake, resting metabolic
   rate (RMR), organ mass and physiological and biochemical markers of
   metabolic activity in the Chinese bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis). Groups
   of Chinese bulbuls were acclimated in a laboratory to the following
   conditions: (1) warm and long photoperiod, (2) warm and short
   photoperiod, (3) cold and long photoperiod, and (4) cold and short
   photoperiod, for 4 weeks. The results indicate that Chinese bulbuls
   exhibit adaptive physiological regulation when exposed to different
   temperatures and photoperiods. M-b, RMR, gross energy intake and
   digestible energy intake were higher in cold-acclimated than in
   warm-acclimated bulbuls, and in the short photoperiod than in the long
   photoperiod. The resultant flexibility in energy intake and RMR allows
   Chinese bulbuls exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods to
   adjust their energy balance and thermogenesis accordingly.
   Cold-acclimated birds had heightened state-4 respiration and cytochrome
   c oxidase activity in their liver and muscle tissue compared with
   warmacclimated birds indicating the cellular mechanisms underlying their
   adaptive thermogenesis. Temperature appears to be a primary cue for
   adjusting energy budget and thermogenic ability in Chinese bulbuls;
   photoperiod appears to intensify temperature-induced changes in energy
   metabolism and thermoregulation.

AB The strong dependence of metabolic rates on body mass has attracted the
   interest of ecological physiologists, as it has important implications
   to many aspects of biology including species variations in body size,
   the evolution of life history, and the structure and function of
   biological communities. The great diversity of observed scaling
   exponents has led some authors to conclude that there is no single
   universal scaling exponent, but instead it ranges from 2/3 to 1. Most of
   the telling evidence against the universality of power scaling exponents
   comes from ontogenetic changes. Nevertheless, there could be other
   sources of phenotypic variation that influence this allometric
   relationship at least at the intraspecific level. In order to explore
   the general concept of the metabolic scaling in terrestrial molluscs we
   tested the role of several biological and methodological sources of
   variation on the empirically estimated scaling exponent. Specifically,
   we measured a proxy of metabolic rate (CO2 production) in 421
   individuals, during three generations, in three different populations.
   Additionally, we measured this scaling relationship in 208 individuals
   at five developmental stages. Our results suggest that the metabolic
   scaling exponent at the intraspecific level does not have a single
   stationary value, but instead it shows some degree of variation across
   geographic distribution, transgenerational change and ontogenetic
   stages. The major differences in the metabolic scaling exponent that we
   found were at different developmental stages of snails, because ontogeny
   involves increases in size at different rates, which in turn, generate
   differential energy demands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that climate change greatly affects human health, even
   though there are few studies on renal outcomes. Heat waves have been
   found to increase cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and
   mortality, as well as the risk of acute renal failure and
   hospitalisation due to renal diseases, with related mortality. Recurrent
   dehydration in people regularly exposed to high temperatures seems to be
   resulting in an unrecognised cause of proteinuric chronic kidney
   disease, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of which is
   becoming better understood. However, beyond heat waves and extreme
   temperatures, there is a seasonal variation in glomerular filtration
   rate that may contribute to the onset of renal failure and electrolyte
   disorders during extremely hot periods. Although there are few
   references in the literature, serum sodium disorders seem to increase.
   The most vulnerable population to heat-related disease are the elderly,
   children, chronic patients, bedridden people, disabled people, people
   living alone or with little social contact, and socioeconomically
   disadvantaged people. (C) 2017 Sociedad Espanola de Nefrologia.

AB Ecological diversification often encompasses exposure to new thermal
   regimes given by the use of specific spatial (microhabitat) and temporal
   (activity periods) niches. Empirical evidence provides links between
   temperature and physiology (e.g. rates of oxygen consumption), fostering
   predictions of evolutionary changes in metabolic rates coupled with
   ecological shifts. One example of such correspondence is the evolution
   offossoriality and nocturnality in vertebrate ectotherms, where changes
   in metabolic rates coupled with niche transitions are expected. Because
   most studies address single transitions (fossoriality or nocturnality),
   metabolic changes associated with concomitant shifts in spatial and
   temporal components of habitat usage are underestimated, and it remains
   unclear which transition plays a major role for metabolic evolution.
   Integrating multiple ecological aspects that affect the evolution of
   thermosensitive traits is essential for a proper understanding of
   physiological correlates in niche transitions. Here, we provide the
   first phylogenetic multidimensional description of effects from
   ecological niche transitions both in space (origin of fossorial
   lineages) and in time (origin of nocturnal lineages) on the evolution of
   microteiid lizard (Gymnophthalmidae) metabolic rates. We found that
   evolution of resting metabolic rates was affected by both niche
   transitions, but with opposite trends. Evolution of fossoriality in
   endemic diurnal microteiids is coupled with a less thermally sensitive
   metabolism and higher metabolic rates. In contrast, a reduction in
   metabolic rates was detected in the endemic fossorial-noctumal lineage,
   although metabolic thermal sensitivity remained as high as that observed
   in epigeal species, a pattern that likely reduces locomotion costs at
   lower temperatures and also favors thermoregulation in subsuperficial
   sand layers.

AB Early life environments shape phenotypic development in important ways
   that can lead to long-lasting effects on phenotype and fitness. In
   reptiles, one aspect of the early environment that impacts development
   is temperature (termed thermal developmental plasticity'). Indeed, the
   thermal environment during incubation is known to influence
   morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, some of which have
   important consequences for many ecological and evolutionary processes.
   Despite this, few studies have attempted to synthesize and collate data
   from this expansive and important body of research. Here, we
   systematically review research into thermal developmental plasticity
   across reptiles, structured around the key papers and findings that have
   shaped the field over the past 50 years. From these papers, we introduce
   a large database (the Reptile Development Database') consisting of 9,773
   trait means across 300 studies examining thermal developmental
   plasticity. This dataset encompasses data on a range of phenotypes,
   including morphological, physiological, behavioral, and performance
   traits along with growth rate, incubation duration, sex ratio, and
   survival (e.g., hatching success) across all major reptile clades.
   Finally, from our literature synthesis and data exploration, we identify
   key research themes associated with thermal developmental plasticity,
   important gaps in empirical research, and demonstrate how future
   progress can be made through targeted empirical, meta-analytic, and
   comparative work.

   of ash and beech seedlings in 12 inter- and intra-specific competition
   designs in simulated mixed ash-beech forest gaps under conditions of
   non-limiting soil volume, water and nutrient supply. The growth
   conditions simulated natural forest conditions as closely as possible.
   Simulations were performed by growing interacting seedling canopies for
   one season in temperature-regulated closed-top chambers (CTCs). Eight
   CTCs were used in a factorial design with replicate treatments of [CO2]
   x temperature x PPFD x competition design. [CO2] tracked ambient levels
   or was 360 mu mol -mol(-1) higher. Temperature tracked ambient levels or
   was 2.8 degrees C higher. PPFD on two plant tables inside each CTC was
   16% and 5% of open-field levels, respectively, representative of typical
   light flux levels in a natural forest gap. in several of the competition
   designs, climate change made the ash seedlings grow taller than the
   beech seedlings and, at the same time, attain a larger leaf area and a
   larger total biomass. Advantages of this type for ash were found
   particularly at lower PPFD. There was a positive synergistic interaction
   of elevated temperature x [CO2] for both species, but more so for ash.
   There are many uncertainties when a study of chambered seedlings is to
   be projected to real changes in natural forests. Nevertheless, this
   study supports a possible future shift towards ash in north European,
   unmanaged, mixed ash-beech forests in response to the predicted climate
   change.

AB Although previous studies have demonstrated that heat-shock protein 70
   (Hsp70) can be induced by environmental stress, little is known about
   natural variation in this response over short time scales. We examined
   how Hsp70 levels varied over days to weeks in two intertidal snail
   species of the genus Tegula. Sampling was conducted both under naturally
   changing environmental conditions and in different vertical zones on a
   rocky shore. The subtidal to low-intertidal T. brunnea was transplanted
   into shaded and unshaded mid-intertidal cages to assess temporal
   variation in Hsps under conditions of increased stress. For comparison,
   the low to mid-intertidal T. funebralis was transplanted into
   mid-intertidal cages, within this species' natural zone of occurrence.
   Snails were sampled every 3 to 4 days for one month, and endogenous
   levels of two Hsp70-kDa family members (Hsp72 and Hsp74) were quantified
   using solid-phase immunochemistry. Following periods of midday low
   tides, levels of Hsps increased greatly in transplanted T brunnea but
   not in T funebralis. Levels of Hsps increased less in T brunnea
   transplanted to shaded cages than to unshaded cages, suggesting that
   prolonged emersion and reduction in feeding time per se are factors that
   are only mildly stressful. Upregulated levels of Hsps returned to base
   levels within days. In unmanipulated snails collected from their natural
   zones, Hsp levels showed little change with thermal variation,
   indicating that these species did not experience thermally stressful
   conditions during this study. However, under common conditions in the
   mid-intertidal zone, Hsp70 levels reflected the different thermal
   sensitivities of the physiological systems of these two species.

AB Spatial population models predict strong density-dependence and
   relatively stable population dynamics near the core of a species'
   distribution with increasing variance and importance of
   density-independent processes operating towards the population
   periphery. Using a 10-year data set and an information-theoretic
   approach, we tested a series of candidate models considering
   density-dependent and density-independent controls on brook trout
   population dynamics across a core-periphery distribution gradient within
   a central Appalachian watershed. We sampled seven sub-populations with
   study sites ranging in drainage area from 1.3-60 km(2) and long-term
   average densities ranging from 0.335-0.006 trout/m. Modeled response
   variables included per capita population growth rate of
   young-of-the-year, adult, and total brook trout. We also quantified a
   stock-recruitment relationship for the headwater population and
   coefficients of variability in mean trout density for all
   sub-populations over time. Density-dependent regulation was prevalent
   throughout the study area regardless of stream size. However,
   density-independent temperature models carried substantial weight and
   likely reflect the effect of year-to-year variability in water
   temperature on trout dispersal between cold tributaries and warm main
   stems. Estimated adult carrying capacities decreased exponentially with
   increasing stream size from 0.24 trout/m in headwaters to 0.005 trout/m
   in the main stem. Finally, temporal variance in brook trout population
   size was lowest in the high-density headwater population, tended to peak
   in mid-sized streams and declined slightly in the largest streams with
   the lowest densities. Our results provide support for the hypothesis
   that local density-dependent processes have a strong control on brook
   trout dynamics across the entire distribution gradient. However, the
   mechanisms of regulation likely shift from competition for limited food
   and space in headwater streams to competition for thermal refugia in
   larger main stems. It also is likely that source-sink dynamics and
   dispersal from small headwater habitats may partially influence brook
   trout population dynamics in the main stem.

AB Primary seed dormancy is an important adaptive plant trait whereby seed
   germination is blocked under conditions that would otherwise be
   favorable for germination. This trait is found in newly produced mature
   seeds of many species, but not all. Once produced, dry seeds undergo an
   aging time period, called dry after-ripening, during which they lose
   primary dormancy and gradually acquire the capacity to germinate when
   exposed to favorable germination conditions. Primary seed dormancy has
   been extensively studied not only for its scientific interest but also
   for its ecological, phenological, and agricultural importance.
   Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying primary seed dormancy and its
   regulation during after-ripening remain poorly understood. Here we
   review the principal developmental stages where primary dormancy is
   established and regulated prior to and during seed after-ripening, where
   it is progressively lost. We attempt to identify and summarize what is
   known about the molecular and genetic mechanisms intervening over time
   in each of these stages.

AB Eutrema salsugineum (Thellungiella salsuginea) is an extremophile, a
   close relative of Arabidopsis, but possessing much higher constitutive
   levels of tolerance to abiotic stress. This study aimed to characterize
   the freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype) and two
   ecotypes of Eutrema (Yukon and Shandong) isolated from contrasting
   geographical locations. Under our growth conditions, maximal freezing
   tolerance was observed after two-and three-weeks of cold acclimation for
   Arabidopsis and Eutrema, respectively. The ecotypes of Eutrema and
   Arabidopsis do not differ in their constitutive level of freezing
   tolerance or short-term cold acclimation capacity. However Eutrema
   remarkably outperforms Arabidopsis in long-term acclimation capacity
   suggesting a wider phenotypic plasticity for the trait of freezing
   tolerance. The combination of drought treatment and one-week of cold
   acclimation was more effective than long-term cold acclimation in
   achieving maximum levels of freezing tolerance in Eutrema, but not
   Arabidopsis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated growth conditions,
   particularly irradiance, are determinates of the level of freezing
   tolerance attained during cold acclimation suggesting a role for
   photosynthetic processes in adaptive stress responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB The present study first addressed the question of whether developmental

   specialist and the generalist invasive Drosophila melanogaster.
   Coincident and positive altitudinal clines across species and, direct
   and inverse latitudinal clines were observed for DT in D. melanogaster
   and D. buzzatii, respectively. Opposing latitudinal and altitudinal
   clines were detected for VT only in D. melanogaster. The patterns
   observed along altitudinal gradients prompted us to investigate whether
   flies living at lowland and highland environments may respond
   differentially to thermal treatments consisting of regimes of constant
   and alternating temperatures. Flies reared at higher mean temperature
   developed faster than at lower mean temperature in both species. By
   contrast, the response in VT differed greatly between species. Highland
   D. melanogaster were more viable than lowland regardless the treatment,
   whereas, in D. buzzatii, highland flies were more viable than lowland in
   alternating thermal regimes and the reverse was true in treatments of
   constant temperature. The results obtained suggest that thermal
   amplitude may be an important factor that should be considered in

   Molecular phenology is defined here as the study of the seasonal
   patterns of organisms captured by molecular biology techniques. The
   history of molecular phenology is reviewed briefly in relation to
   advances in the quantification technology of gene expression.
   High-resolution molecular phenology (HMP) data have enabled us to study
   phenology with an approach of innatura systems biology. I review recent
   analyses of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a temperature-responsive repressor
   of flowering, along the six steps in the typical flow of innatura
   systems biology. The extensive studies of the regulation of FLC have
   made this example a successful case in which a comprehensive
   understanding of gene functions has been progressing. The FLC-mediated
   long-term memory of past temperatures creates time lags with other
   seasonal signals, such as photoperiod and short-term temperature. Major
   signals that control flowering time have a phase lag between them under
   natural conditions, and hypothetical phase lag calendars are proposed as
   mechanisms of season detection in plants. Transcriptomic HMP brings a
   novel strategy to the study of molecular phenology, because it provides
   a comprehensive representation of plant functions. I discuss future
   perspectives of molecular phenology from the standpoints of molecular
   biology, evolutionary biology and ecology.

AB The structure of environmentally induced phenotypic covariation can
   influence the effective strength and magnitude of natural selection. Yet
   our understanding of the factors that contribute to and influence the
   evolutionary lability of such covariation is poor. Most studies have
   either examined environmental variation without accounting for
   covariation, or examined phenotypic and genetic covariation without
   distinguishing the environmental component. In this study, we examined
   the effect of mutational perturbations on different properties of
   environmental covariation, as well as mean shape. We use strains of
   Drosophila melanogaster bearing well-characterized mutations known to
   influence wing shape, as well as naturally derived strains, all reared
   under carefully controlled conditions and with the same genetic
   background. We find that mean shape changes more freely than the
   covariance structure, and that different properties of the covariance
   matrix change independently from each other. The perturbations affect
   matrix orientation more than they affect matrix eccentricity or total
   variance. Yet, mutational effects on matrix orientation do not cluster
   according to the developmental pathway that they target. These results
   suggest that it might be useful to consider a more general concept of
   decanalization, involving all aspects of variation and covariation.

AB Exposure to extreme temperatures is increasingly likely to impose strong
   selection on many organisms in their natural environments. The ability
   of organisms to adapt to such selective pressures will be determined by
   patterns of genetic variation and covariation. Despite increasing
   interest in thermal adaptation, few studies have examined the extent to
   which the genetic covariance between traits might constrain thermal
   responses. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether sex-specific genetic
   architectures will constrain responses to climatic selection. We used a
   paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific
   genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might
   constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of
   Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the sexes share a
   common genetic underpinning for heat tolerance as indicated by a strong
   positive inter-sexual genetic correlation. Further, we found no evidence
   in either of the sexes that genetic trade-offs between heat tolerance
   and fitness will constrain responses to thermal selection. Our results
   suggest that neither trade-offs, nor sex-specific genetics, will
   significantly constrain an evolutionary response to climatic warming, at
   least in this population of D.similar to melanogaster.

AB Many marine invertebrates with complex life cycles produce planktonic
   larvae that experience environmental conditions different from those
   encountered by adults. Factors such as temperature and food, known to
   impact the larval period, can also affect larval size and consequently
   the size of newly settled juveniles. After documenting natural variation
   in the size of cyprids (the final larval stage) of the barnacle Balanus
   glandula, we experimentally manipulated temperature and food given to
   larvae to produce cyprids of differing sizes but within the size range
   of cyprids found in the field. In a set of trials in which larvae of B.
   glandula were raised on full or reduced rations in the laboratory and
   subsequently outplanted into the field as newly metamorphosed juveniles,
   we explored the effects of larval nutrition and size on juvenile
   performance. Larvae that received full rations throughout their feeding
   period produced larger cyprids (with more lipid and protein). These
   larger cyprids grew faster as juveniles and sometimes survived better in
   the field than juveniles from larvae that had their food ration reduced
   in the last feeding instar. For naturally settling barnacles brought
   into the laboratory within 2 days of settlement and fed, we found that
   initial juvenile size was a good predictor of juvenile size even after 2
   weeks of growth. By manipulating food given to juveniles that were
   derived from larvae fed either full or reduced rations, we found that
   larval nutritional effects persisted in juveniles for 2-3 times the
   period that larvae experienced altered food rations.

AB Eggs of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) were incubated at three
   temperatures approaching the upper limit of viability for embryonic
   development in this species (26, 29, and 32 degrees C) to assess the
   influence of temperature on various aspects of hatchling phenotype
   likely affecting fitness. The thermal environment affected size and
   several morphometric characteristics of hatchling lizards. Hatchlings
   from eggs incubated at 32 degrees C were smaller (snout-vent length,
   SVL) than those from 26 and 29 degrees C and had smaller mass residuals
   (from the regression on SVL) as well as shorter tail, head, and femur
   relative to SVL. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry in
   meristic and morphometric traits associated with incubation temperatures
   was quite high but not clearly consistent with the prediction that
   environmental stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures
   might produce the highest level of asymmetry. When tested for locomotor
   capacity in trials developed at body temperatures of 32 and 35 degrees
   C, hatchlings from the 32 degrees C incubation treatment exhibited the
   worst performance in any aspect considered (burst speed, maximal length,
   and number of stops in the complete run). Repeated measures ANCOVAs
   (with initial egg mass as covariate) of snout-vent length and mass of
   lizards at days 0 and 20 revealed significant effects of incubation
   temperature only for mass, being again the hatchlings from eggs
   incubated at 32 degrees C those exhibiting the smallest final size. All
   together, our results evidenced a pervasive effect of thermal regime
   during incubation (and hence of nest site selection) on hatchling
   phenotypes. However, incubation temperature does not affect hatchling
   phenotypes in a continuous way; for most of the analysed traits a
   critical threshold seems to exist between 29 and 32 degrees C, so that
   hatchlings incubated at 32 degrees C exhibited major detrimental
   effects. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Understanding the basis for intraspecific yield variability may be
   important in elucidating biological mechanisms that are associated with
   superior yield performance in response to projected increases in carbon
   dioxide concentration, [CO2]. Using a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)
   facility, two rice lines, S63 and W14, which differed consistently in
   their enhancement of seed yield when grown at elevated [CO2] in multiple
   field trials, were examined. To determine if the different cultivar
   responses were linked to changes in photosynthetic characteristics at
   elevated [CO2], spatial and temporal changes in photosynthetic
   stimulation and the occurrence of down-regulation, or acclimation, in
   relation to panicle sink development were quantified for the uppermost
   canopy leaves. Changes in photosynthetic capacity were determined by
   quantifying changes in the sink: source ratio, leaf nitrogen (N)
   content, the concentration and mRNA expression of the large Rubisco
   subunit, and changes in V-c,V-max, the maximum ribulose bisphosphate
   (RuBP)-saturated rate of carboxylation. For the W14 cultivar,
   significant reductions in photosynthesis at the elevated, relative to
   ambient [CO2], signalling photosynthetic acclimation, were observed
   following panicle initiation. The observance of photosynthetic
   acclimation was consistent with significant reductions in N, Rubisco
   content and expression, and V-c,V-max. In contrast, for the cultivar
   S63, elevated [CO2] resulted in increased spikelet number and grain
   weight, increased sink: source ratios, and continued stimulation of
   photosynthesis up to grain maturity. Overall, these data suggest that
   the greater response of the S63 line to elevated [CO2] may be associated
   with enhanced carbon sinks relative to sources, and the ability to
   maintain photosynthetic capacity during grain development.

AB Recent field and retrospective data were combined to investigate
   variations from 1984 to 1998 in the spring abundance of dominant
   copepods in the Yellow Sea. A calanoid copepod, Calanus sinicus, was
   chosen to assess the long-term changes in abundance associated with
   temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a and predator abundance. Average
   anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, and the abundance
   of C. sinicus were positive in the 1990s and negative in the 1980s. The
   average abundances of C. sinicus in the study area in the 1990s were
   also significantly higher than those in the 1980s (p < 0.01). Catches of
   the anchovy Engraulis japonicus, a predator of C sinicus, showed a
   decreasing trend during the study period. The higher abundances of C
   sinicus in the 1990s may have been affected by an increase in water
   temperature and a decrease in predators, without distinctive changes in
   chlorophyll-a concentrations during the study period. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Cell death (CD) in Vitis vinifera L grape berries, exemplified in
   Shiraz, occurs late in ripening influencing yield, berry and wine
   quality. Here we isolated and functionally characterised a
   BON1-associated gene, VvBAP1 from Shiraz berries, encoding a small
   protein with a C2 domain. VvBAP1 transcript increased during fruit
   development from veraison to harvest, and was significantly inhibited by
   drought stress 92 days after flowering when CD normally begins. This was
   correlated with high CD in Shiraz berries. The agrobacterium-mediated
   transient expression of VvBAP1 in tobacco leaves led to a decrease in
   electrolyte leakage and downregulated a marker gene (Hsr203J) for cell
   death. Expressing VvBAP1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) also
   alleviated cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
   Overexpression of VvBAP1 in Arabidopsis increased resistance to H2O2 and
   reduced CD due to higher expression of genes involved in anti-oxidative
   responses. Arabidopsis overexpressing VvBAP1 displayed higher tolerance
   to drought accompanied by upregulation of antioxidant-related gene
   expression. VvBAP1 complemented an Arabidopsis bap1 knockout by
   abolishing its CD phenotypes. These results indicate that VvBAP1 may
   play a role in alleviating CD in grape berries and its downregulation
   under drought stress may be responsible for the generally observed
   increase in CD within the berry.

AB The present contribution focuses on the application of the multiscale
   finite element method to the modeling of actin networks that are
   embedded in the cytosol. These cell components are of particular
   importance with regard to the cell response to external stimuli. The
   homogenization strategy chosen uses the Hill-Mandel macrohomogeneity
   condition for bridging 2 scales: the macroscopic scale that is related
   to the cell level and the microscopic scale related to the
   representative volume element. For the modeling of filaments, the
   Holzapfel-Ogden -model is applied. It provides a relationship between
   the tensile force and the caused stretches, serves as the basis for the
   derivation of the stress and elasticity tensors, and enables a novel
   finite element implementation. The elements with the neo-Hookean
   constitutive law are applied for the simulation of the cytosol. The
   results presented corroborate the main advantage of the concept, namely,
   its flexibility with regard to the choice of the representative volume
   element as well as of macroscopic tests. The focus is particularly
   placed on the study of the filament orientation and of its influence on
   the effective behavior.

   for CO(2) (K(c)) than the enzyme from C(3) species, but variation in
   other kinetic parameters between the two photosynthetic pathways has not
   been extensively examined. The CO(2)/O(2) specificity (S(C/O)),
   kcat(CO2), K(c), and the K(m) for O(2) (K(o)) and RuBP (K(m-RuBP)), were
   measured at 25 degrees C, in Rubisco purified from 16 species of
   Flaveria (Asteraceae). Our analysis included two C(3) species of
   Flaveria, four C(4) species, and ten C(3)-C(4) or C(4)-like species, in
   addition to other C(4) (Zea mays and Amaranthus edulis) and C(3)
   (Spinacea oleracea and Chenopodium album) plants. The S(C/O) of the C(4)
   Flaveria species was about 77 mol mol 21, which was approximately 5%
   lower than the corresponding value in the C(3) species. For Rubisco from
   the C(4) Flaverias kcat(CO2) and K(c) were 23% and 45% higher,
   respectively, than for Rubisco from the C(3) plants. Interestingly, it
   was found that the K(o) for Rubisco from the C(4) species F. bidentis
   and F. trinervia were similar to the C(3) Flaveria Rubiscos (similar to
   650 mu M) while the K(o) for Rubisco in the C(4) species F. kochiana, F.
   australasica, Z. mays, and A. edulis was reduced more than 2-fold. There
   were no pathway-related differences in Km-RuBP. In the C(3)-C(4) species
   kcat(CO2) and Kc were generally similar to the C(3) Rubiscos, but the
   K(o) values were more variable. The typical negative relationships were
   observed between S(C/O) and both kcat(CO2) and K(c), and a strongly
   positive relationship was observed between kcat(CO2) and K(c). However,
   the statistical significance of these relationships was influenced by
   the phylogenetic relatedness of the species.

AB Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, living at a range of tidal heights,
   routinely encounter large seasonal fluctuations in temperature. We
   demonstrate that the thermal limits of oysters are relatively plastic,
   and that these limits are correlated with changes in the expression of
   one family of heat-shock proteins (HSP70). Oysters were cultured in the
   intertidal zone, at two tidal heights, and monitored for changes in
   expression of cognate (HSC) and inducible (HSP) heat-shock proteins
   during the progression from spring through winter. We found that the
   "control" levels (i.e., prior to laboratory heat shock) of HSC77 and
   HSC72 are positively correlated with increases in ambient temperature
   and were significantly higher in August than in January. The elevated
   level of HSCs during the summer was associated with moderate, 2-3
   degreesC, increases in the upper thermal limits for survival. We
   measured concomitant increases in the threshold temperatures (T-on)
   required for induction of HSP70. Total hsp70 mRNA expression reflected
   the seasonal changes in the expression of inducible but not cognate
   members of the HSP70 family of proteins. A potential cost of increased
   T-on in the summer is that there was no extension of the upper thermal
   limits for survival (i.e., induction of thermotolerance) after sublethal
   heat shock at temperatures that were sufficient to induce
   thermotolerance during the winter months.

AB With the development of urbanization in China, construction land (CL)
   expansion is obvious, and urban heat island (UHI) is becoming more and
   more serious. Many scholars have shown a strong interest in the study of
   UHI caused by land expansion, but less attention has been paid to the
   coupling relationship between CL expansion and high-temperature area
   (HTA) expansion during the process of urbanization. This study obtained
   the land surface temperature (LST) data of China's three major urban
   agglomerations (CTM-UAs) in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. Then this paper
   used overall coupling model and spatial coupling model to reveal the
   coupling relationship between the CL expansion and HTA expansion of
   CTM-UAs in different periods. The results showed that: (1) From 2000 to
   2015, the trend of CL expansion and HTA expansion in CTM-UAs was
   synchronous; (2) The distance between the CL barycentre and HTA
   barycentre in CTM-UAs was shrinking, the spatial overlap was constantly
   strengthening, and the overall coupling was constantly strengthening.
   And the highest value of the overall coupling was reached in 2015; (3)
   The number of grid units of very strong coupling and strong coupling
   increased with fluctuation in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Urban

   (YRD) was increasing, and that of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Urban

AB Background: The spatial distribution of genetic diversity and structure
   has important implications for conservation as it reveals a species'
   strong and weak points with regard to stability and evolutionary
   capacity. Temporal genetic stability is rarely tested in marine species
   other than commercially important fishes, but is crucial for the utility
   of temporal snapshots in conservation management. High and stable
   diversity can help to mitigate the predicted northward range shift of
   seaweeds under the impact of climate change. Given the key ecological
   role of fucoid seaweeds along rocky shores, the positive effect of
   genetic diversity may reach beyond the species level to stabilize the
   entire intertidal ecosystem along the temperate North Atlantic. In this
   study, we estimated the effective population size, as well as temporal
   changes in genetic structure and diversity of the seaweed F. serratus
   using 22 microsatellite markers. Samples were taken across latitudes and
   a range of temperature regimes at seven locations with decadal sampling
   (2000 and 2010).
   Results: Across latitudes, genetic structure and diversity remained
   stable over 5-10 generations. Stable small-scale structure enhanced
   regional diversity throughout the species' range. In accordance with its
   biogeographic history, effective population size and diversity peaked in
   the species' mid-range in Brittany (France), and declined towards its
   leading and trailing edge to the north and south. At the species'
   southern edge, multi-locus-heterozygosity displayed a strong decline
   from 1999 to 2010.
   Conclusion: Temporally stable genetic structure over small spatial
   scales is a potential driver for local adaptation and species radiation
   in the genus Fucus. Survival and adaptation of the low-diversity leading
   edge of F. serratus may be enhanced by regional gene flow and 'surfing'
   of favorable mutations or impaired by the accumulation of deleterious
   mutations. Our results have clear implications for the conservation of
   F. serratus at its genetically unique southern edge in Northwest Iberia,
   where increasing temperatures are likely the major cause for the decline
   not only of F. serratus, but also other intertidal and subtidal
   macroalgae. We expect that F. serratus will disappear from Northwest
   Iberia by 2100 if genetic rescue is not induced by the influx of genetic
   variation from Brittany.

   particular interest are accessions with putatively locally adapted
   phenotypes - that is, accessions with attributes that are likely
   adaptive at their sites of origin. These genotypes may provide insight
   into the genetic basis of adaptive evolution as well as allow the
   discovery of genes of ecological importance. We studied the physiology,
   genome content and gene expression of two physiologically extreme
   accessions (Tsu-1 from Tsushima, Japan and Kas-1 from Kashmir, India).
   Our study was conducted under two levels of soil moisture and
   accompanied by physiological measurements to characterize early
   responses to soil drying. Genomic hybridizations identified 42 503
   single feature polymorphisms (SFP) between accessions, providing an
   initial screen for genetic differences. Transcript profiling identified
   a large number (5996) of genes exhibiting constitutive differences in
   expression including genes involved in many biological pathways. Mild
   soil drying resulted in only subtle physiological responses but resulted
   in gene expression changes in hundreds of transcripts, including 352
   genes exhibiting differential responses between accessions. Our results
   highlight the value of genomic studies of natural accessions as well as
   identify a number of candidate genes underlying physiological
   differences between Tsu-1 and Kas-1.

   feed intake in fall and winter seasons. A total of 378 beef steers in 5
   cohorts were fed a typical high energy feedlot diet and had free-choice
   access to feed and water. Feed intake data were collected in fall or
   winter seasons. Climate data were obtained from the University of
   Alberta Kinsella meteorological station and Vikings AGCM station.
   Individual animal RFI was obtained by either fitting a regression model
   to each test group separately (RFIC), fitting a regression model to
   pooled data consisting of all cohorts but including test group as a
   fixed effect (RFIO), or fitting a regression to pooled data with test
   group as a fixed effect but within seasonal (fall-winter or
   winter-spring) groups (RFIS). Two animal models (M1 and M2) that
   differed by the inclusion of fixed effects of test group or season,
   respectively, were used to evaluate RFI measurements. Feed intake was
   correlated with air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and
   wind speed (-0.26, 0.23, 0.30, -0.14 for fall-winter and 0.31, -0.04,
   0.14, 0.16 for winter-spring, respectively), but the nature and
   magnitude of the correlations were different for the 2 seasons. Single
   trait direct heritability, model likelihood, direct genetic variance,
   and EBV accuracy estimates were greatest for RFIC and least for RFIO for
   both M1 and M2 models. A significant genetic correlation was also
   observed between RFIO and ADG, but not for RFIC and RFIS. Including a
   season effect (M2) in the genetic evaluation of RFIO resulted in the
   smallest heritability, model LogL, EBV accuracy, and largest residual
   variance estimates. These results, though not conclusive, suggest a
   possible effect of seasonality on feed intake and thus feed efficiency.

AB The larval morphology and developmental rate of Chrysomya megacephala
   (F.) and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart), the two most forensically
   important blowfly species in Thailand, are presented. Morphological
   comparison of the third instar of both species revealed different
   characteristics (e.g., body appearance, cephalopharyngeal skeleton,
   dorsal cuticular spines between the prothorax and mesothorax, and
   feature of the posterior spiracle), thereby, allowing correct
   identification. A data analysis was conducted in Chiang Mai province,
   Northern Thailand during 2000-2001 on the developmental rate of both
   flies under natural ambient temperature and a natural light-dark
   photoperiod. The results indicated that larvae of C. megacephala
   developed more rapidly in April, pupariation initiated at 84 h at
   temperatures averaging 31.4 degrees C, and the larvae grew slower in the
   rainy season and winter. Similarly, rapid development of C. rufifacies
   larvae appeared in the summer, with a pupariation period as short as 96
   h in June (average temperature 27.4 degrees C). Analysis of the median
   body length of C. megacephala and C. rufifacies larvae in different
   seasons of the years 2000-2001 in Thailand revealed that both species
   developed rapidly in the summer; pupariation of C. rufifacies initiated
   at 144 h, while C. megacephala initiated pupariation at 156 h. This
   information is potentially useful for estimating the postmortem interval
   of a corpse in forensic investigations, where the corpse becomes
   infesting with these fly species.

AB This study aims to evaluate the health status of Bizerta lagoon using a
   sentinel species, the Neogastropod Murex trunculus. Trace metal
   concentrations (Cd, Cu and Zn) in the foot and digestive gland, and
   biomarkers such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase ( CAT) and
   glutathione transferase (GST) activities in the digestive gland, were
   determined in samples collected at four sites at different periods of
   the year. One site, in the North of the lagoon, is influenced by urban
   and industrial waste waters. Another, to the south, is located at the
   outfall of Ichkeul Lake. A third site is one that may be impacted by
   eutrophication processes, and the last, in the center of lagoon, is
   considered as less polluted. Temperature and salinity were
   simultaneously measured during the mollusc samplings. They varied
   greatly, from 13.5 degrees C and 30 psu in February to much higher
   values in summer-autumn: 30.7 degrees C and 37 psu. Metal concentrations
   were always higher in the digestive gland than in the foot. In the
   digestive gland, the lowest Cd and Cu concentrations were found in the
   center of the lagoon (mean +/- standard deviation: 9.35 +/- 0.78 mu g Cd
   g(-1) and 84.5 +/- 15.3 mu g Cu g(-1)) and no significant Zn variations
   were noted (682 +/- 38 mu g g(-1)) between sites. Metal concentrations
   in both types of tissue were higher in winter than in summer. AChE
   varied significantly among sites with high activities for individuals in
   the center of lagoon (15.4 +/- 0.3 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), whereas
   GST were low (12.2 +/- 0.8 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein); CAT activities
   were low in this site 8.7 +/- 0.5 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein. Season
   also had an influence on biomarkers, with low AChE in winter and rather
   low CAT and GST in summer. Principal component analysis showed that the
   center of lagoon can be considered as a reference site, whereas high
   chemical and biochemical responses were found in M. trunculus from other
   sites; particularly at the site which may be subject to eutrophication.

AB Management of invasive species is addressed in both national and
   international regulations regarding the protection of marine habitats
   and biodiversity and in regulations of aquaculture. The geographical
   range of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is expanding,
   both through human mediated vectors and by natural dispersal. The
   species is now spreading in Scandinavia. In order to optimize the
   management of the oyster, including targeted monitoring and mitigation
   activities, knowledge on the present and future distribution and impact
   on the ecosystem is important. The development of the population and the
   potential impacts on native ecosystems were analyzed, based on the
   present scientific knowledge on the distribution in Scandinavia, data on
   new settlements and existing literature. Data was first evaluated by 14
   experts (including the authors) during a workshop, relating the current
   status of habitats where Pacific oysters are found in Scandinavia (Low
   energy rock, Littoral sand and mudflats, Littoral biogenic reefs,
   Sublittoral sand and Sublittoral biogenic reefs) to a predicted
   development, thereafter assessed in relation to impact on the habitats.
   The assessment was done as a function of climate change in a longterm
   IPCC climate scenario (A1B). We conclude that Littoral biogenic reefs
   are at risk to obtain the highest expected increase, while all other
   habitats are at risk of low to moderate development of the oyster
   populations. Accordingly, Littoral Biogenic reefs was assessed as the
   habitat type at risk of the largest ecosystem effects as high densities
   of oysters already exist in these areas, and the densities are expected
   to increase rapidly until reaching a threshold density. Low energy rock
   and Littoral sand and mud were assessed as being subjected to moderate
   to high ecosystem effects. Sub-littoral sand and Sub-littoral biogenic
   reefs were assessed as currently being at risk of moderate ecosystem
   effects as there are low densities of oysters in these habitats,
   although densities in sublittoral biogenic reefs has the potential to
   increase. We discuss management and mitigation strategies based on the
   forecasted development and effects of the Pacific oyster populations.

AB In order to better explore quantitative reconstructions of net primary
   productivity (NPP) conditions using a dinoflagellate cyst
   (dinocyst)-based transfer function method, we revised the tropical
   Atlantic modern dinocyst database n = 208 (Marret et al., 2008). Modern
   assemblages from the worldwide dinocyst atlas (Zonneveld et al., 2013)
   were added to provide a better geographical coverage of the South
   Atlantic Ocean. The environmental dataset was updated using the World
   Ocean Atlas 2013 for sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface
   salinity (SSS) data, as well as for 1997-2017 mean NPP values recorded
   during SeaWifs and MODIS spatial programs. New environmental datasets
   were tested using anomalies regarding mean latitudinal SST as a
   potential index to track past upwelling activity. Finally, preindustrial
   NPP values, simulated with the IPSL-CM5A-LR model developed at the
   Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) have been added to the dinocyst
   environmental database to provide NPP values consistent with the mean
   age of "modern" dinocyst assemblages. The transfer function method using
   the updated modern database was then applied to fossil dinocyst
   assemblages of core KZAI-01, retrieved off the Congo River mouth and
   covering the last 43.2 kyr. Our results indicate a dominant orbital
   forcing, with higher primary productivity values reconstructed during
   precession minima (MIS 3 and the last deglaciation) and enhanced by a
   maximum of obliquity during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. The
   synchronicity between high upwelling intensity and high terrigenous
   inputs during high NPP period (e.g. during the last Deglaciation)
   highlighted the prevalent role of river-induced upwelling activity,
   which is specific to the Congo River. These results have improved our
   understanding of the environmental forcing leading to major trophic
   changes in the intertropical area.

AB Parthenogenetic species are usually considered to be short-lived due to
   the accumulation of adverse mutations, lack of genetic variability, and
   inability to adapt to changing environment. If so, one may expect that
   the phenotype of clonal organisms may reflect such genetic and/or
   environmental stress. To test this hypothesis, we compared the
   developmental stability of bisexual and parthenogenetic lizards of the
   genus Darevskia. We assessed asymmetries in three meristic traits:
   ventral, preanal, and supratemporal scales. Our results suggest that the
   amount of ventral and preanal asymmetries is significantly higher in
   clones compared with their maternal, but not paternal, progenitor
   species. However, it is questionable, whether this is a consequence of
   clonality, as it may be considered a mild form of outbreeding depression
   as well. Moreover, most ventral asymmetries were found in the bisexual
   species Darevskia valentini. We suggest that greater differences in
   asymmetry levels among bisexuals may be, for instance, a consequence of
   the population size: the smaller the population, the higher the
   inbreeding and the developmental instability. On the basis of the traits
   examined in this study, the parthenogens do not seem to be of
   significantly poorer quality.

AB Although most antlion species do not construct pits, the vast majority
   of studies on antlions focused on pit-building species. We report here
   on a transplant experiment aiming to test for morphological and life
   history differences between two desert populations of a sit-and-pursue
   antlion species, Lopezus fedtschenkoi (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae),
   originating from habitats, which mainly differ in plant cover and
   productivity. We raised the antlion larvae in environmental chambers
   simulating either hyper-arid or Mediterranean climate. We found
   significant differences in the morphology and life history of L.
   fedtschenkoi larvae between the two populations. For example, the larvae
   originating from the more productive habitat pupated faster and had a
   higher growth rate. In agreement with the temperature-size rule,
   antlions reached higher final mass in the colder Mediterranean climate
   and exhibited a higher growth rate, but there was no difference in their
   developmental time. Observed differences in morphology between
   populations as well as those triggered by climate growing conditions
   could be explained by differences in size allometry. We also provide a
   quantitative description of the allometric growth axis, based on 12
   morphological traits. Comparing the responses of L. fedtschenkoi with
   those observed in a co-occurring pit-building antlion indicated that
   there were neither shape differences that are independent of size nor
   was there a difference in the plasticity level between the two species.

AB Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more
   frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat
   production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop
   productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress
   experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat,
   DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4years of
   environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat
   cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat
   stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and
   individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly
   decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat
   stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain
   yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on
   cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat
   degree days (HDD, degree days over 30 degrees C), grain filling duration
   was reduced by 0.30-0.60%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by
   0.37-0.43%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0-1.6%, but GPC was
   increased by 0.50% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80% for cv Xumai30. The tested
   crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions
   in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain
   yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat stress. Most
   of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during
   grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require
   improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but
   all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain
   set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the
   response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar
   parameters in future simulation studies.

AB The role of land plants in establishing our present day atmosphere is
   analysed. Before the evolution of land plants, photosynthesis by marine
   and fresh water organisms was not intensive enough to deplete CO2 from
   the atmosphere, the concentration of which was more than the order of
   magnitude higher than present. With the appearance of land plants, the
   exudation of organic acids by roots, following respiratory and
   photorespiratory metabolism, led to phosphate weathering from rocks thus
   increasing aquatic productivity. Weathering also replaced silicates by
   carbonates, thus decreasing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. As a
   result of both intensive photosynthesis and weathering, CO2 was depleted
   from the atmosphere down to low values approaching the compensation
   point of land plants. During the same time period, the atmospheric O-2
   concentration increased to maximum levels about 300 million years ago
   (Permo-Carboniferous boundary), establishing an O-2/CO2 ratio above
   1000. At this point, land plant productivity and weathering strongly
   decreased, exerting negative feedback on aquatic productivity. Increased
   CO2 concentrations were triggered by asteroid impacts and volcanic
   activity and in the Mesozoic era could be related to the gymnosperm
   flora with lower metabolic and weathering rates. A high O-2/CO2 ratio is
   metabolically linked to the formation of citrate and oxalate, the main
   factors causing weathering, and to the production of reactive oxygen
   species, which triggered mutations and stimulated the evolution of land
   plants. The development of angiosperms resulted in a decrease in CO2
   concentration during the Cenozoic era, which finally led to the
   glacial-interglacial oscillations in the Pleistocene epoch.
   Photorespiration, the rate of which is directly related to the O-2/CO2
   ratio, due to the dual function of Rubisco, may be an important
   mechanism in maintaining the limits of O-2 and CO2 concentrations by
   restricting land plant productivity and weathering.

   variables. Optimum timing for estimating sugarcane yield was between
   601-750 GDD. In-season estimated yield values improved the yield
   potential (YP) model compared to using NDVI. Generally, INSEY value
   showed a positive exponential relationship with yield (r(2) values 0.48
   and 0.42 for cane tonnage and sugar yield, respectively). When models
   were separated based on canopy structure there was an increase the
   strength of the relationship for the erectophile varieties (r(2) 0.53
   and 0.47 for cane tonnage and sugar yield, respectively); however, the
   model for planophile varieties weakened slightly. Results of this study
   indicate using an INSEY value for predicting sugarcane yield shows
   potential of being a valuable management tool for sugarcane producers in
   Louisiana.

AB Intraspecific variation in genotypically determined traits can influence
   ecosystem processes. Therefore, the impact of climate change on
   ecosystems may depend, in part, on the distribution of plant genotypes.
   Here we experimentally assess effects of climate warming and excess
   nitrogen supply on litter decomposition using 12 genotypes of a
   cosmopolitan foundation species collected across a 2100 km latitudinal
   gradient and grown in a common garden. Genotypically determined
   litter-chemistry traits varied substantially within and among geographic
   regions, which strongly affected decomposition and the magnitude of
   warming effects, as warming accelerated litter mass loss of
   high-nutrient, but not low-nutrient, genotypes. Although increased
   nitrogen supply alone had no effect on decomposition, it strongly
   accelerated litter mass loss of all genotypes when combined with
   warming. Rates of microbial respiration associated with the leaf litter
   showed nearly identical responses as litter mass loss. These results
   highlight the importance of interactive effects of environmental factors
   and suggest that loss or gain of genetic variation associated with key
   phenotypic traits can buffer, or exacerbate, the impact of global change
   on ecosystem process rates in the future.

AB Host shifts cause drastic consequences on fitness in cactophilic species
   of Drosophila. It has been argued that changes in the nutritional values
   accompanying host shifts may elicit these fitness responses, but they
   may also reflect the presence of potentially toxic secondary compounds
   that affect resource quality. Recent studies reported that alkaloids
   extracted from the columnar cactus Trichocereus terscheckii are toxic
   for the developing larvae of Drosophila buzzatii. In this study, we
   tested the effect of artificial diets including increasing doses of host
   alkaloids on developmental stability and wing morphology in D.buzzatii.
   We found that alkaloids disrupt normal wing venation patterning and
   affect viability, wing size and fluctuating asymmetry, suggesting the
   involvement of stress-response mechanisms. Theoretical implications are
   discussed in the context of developmental stability, stress, fitness and
   their relationship with robustness, canalization and phenotypic
   plasticity.

   (20.5%), beta-eudesmol (13.6%), beta-caryophyllene (10.6%), valencene
   (9.3%), tau-cadinol (9.3%), alpha-pinene (6.9%) and gamma-cadinene
   (5.8%). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was evaluated
   using disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. A great potential
   antimicrobial activity was observed against Staphylococcus epidermidis
   and Candida albicans, followed by Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus
   aureus and Listeria monocytogenes, with their respective zones of
   inhibition of 13.33 +/- 1.52 to 40.5 +/- 2.12 mm and minimal inhibition
   concentration (MIC) values of 0.062-1mg/mL. The plant essential oil was
   also subjected to screenings for the evaluation of their antioxidant
   activities using 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
   beta-carotene-linoleic acid tests, and weak activities were found for
   this essential oil.

AB The extent of energy depletion was assessed in Atlantic cod (Gadus
   morhua) in spring and early summer (1993-1995) to assess relationships
   between poor condition and natural mortality. Several indices of
   condition were compared in wild fish in the northern Gulf of St.
   Lawrence and in fish exposed to a prolonged period of starvation in
   laboratory experiments. Discriminant analyses classified only a small
   fraction of the wild fish as similar to cod that did not survive and a
   much larger fraction as similar to cod that survived starvation. This
   percentage increased from April to May and peaked in June 1993 and 1994.
   Condition factor and muscle somatic index allowed a clear distinction
   between live and dead fish. Muscle lactate dehydrogenase activity
   suggested that cod had experienced a period of negative growth early in
   1993, 1994, and 1995. Fish classified as similar to starved individuals
   were characterized by a higher gonad to liver mass ratio than others.
   Reproduction may have a negative impact on survival not only in spring
   but also later into summer, as some individuals were found not to have
   recovered by late summer. This study shows that natural mortality from
   poor condition contributed to lower production in the early 1990s.

AB As field phenotyping of plant response to water constraints constitutes
   a bottleneck for breeding programmes, airborne thermal imagery can
   contribute to assessing the water status of a wide range of individuals
   simultaneously. However, the presence of mixed soil-plant pixels in
   heterogeneous plant cover complicates the interpretation of canopy
   temperature. Moran's Water Deficit Index (WDI = 1-ETact/ETmax), which
   was designed to overcome this difficulty, was compared with surface
   minus air temperature (T-s-T-a) as a water stress indicator. As
   parameterization of the theoretical equations for WDI computation is
   difficult, particularly when applied to genotypes with large
   architectural variability, a simplified procedure based on quantile
   regression was proposed to delineate the Vegetation Index-Temperature
   (VIT) scatterplot. The sensitivity of WDI to variations in wet and dry
   references was assessed by applying more or less stringent quantile
   levels. The different stress indicators tested on a series of airborne
   multispectral images (RGB, near-infrared, and thermal infrared) of a
   population of 122 apple hybrids, under two irrigation regimes,
   significantly discriminated the tree water statuses. For each
   acquisition date, the statistical method efficiently delineated the VIT
   scatterplot, while the limits obtained using the theoretical approach
   overlapped it, leading to inconsistent WDI values. Once water constraint
   was established, the different stress indicators were linearly
   correlated to the stem water potential among a tree subset. T-s-T-a
   showed a strong sensitivity to evaporative demand, which limited its
   relevancy for temporal comparisons. Finally, the statistical approach of
   WDI appeared the most suitable for high-throughput phenotyping.

AB The circadian clock regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and

   clock components, primarily in Arabidopsis, has led to recent rapid
   progress in our understanding of the clock mechanism in higher plants.
   Using mathematical modeling and experimental approaches, workers in the
   field have developed a model of the clock that incorporates both
   transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of clock genes. This
   cell-autonomous clock, or oscillator, generates rhythmic outputs that
   can be monitored at the cellular and whole-organism level. The clock not
   only confers daily rhythms in growth and metabolism, but also interacts
   with signaling pathways involved in plant responses to the environment.
   Future work will lead to a better understanding of how the clock and
   other signaling networks are integrated to provide plants with an

AB Sedimentary diatom assemblages from three lakes in the Southeastern
   Swiss Alps were analysed at high temporal resolution since AD 1800.
   Altered land-use patterns, increasing population and exploitation
   through tourism are clearly reflected in annually laminated sediments of
   Lej da San Murezzan (Lake St Moritz) and Lej da Silvaplauna (Lake
   Silvaplana). Diatom assemblages originally dominated by Cyclotella taxa
   are replaced by taxa indicating higher total phosphorus (TP)
   concentrations, such as Asterionella formosa, Frogilaria crotonensis and
   Stephanodiscus parvus. In Lej da la Tscheppa, located well above the
   treeline in a catchment that was hardly exposed 10 human impact,
   Cyclotella comensis prevails throughout the entire sediment sequence.
   Quantitative estimates of past TP concentrations were inferred using a
   newly developed regional diatom-TP inference model based on 119 modern
   samples. In Lej da la Tscheppa diatoms imply stable, low TP
   concentrations (similar to 10 mu g/1), which can be considered as
   natural background concentration. Elevated TP levels are interred for
   Lej da San Murezzan (max. 60 mu g/1) since AD 1910 and for Lej da
   Silvaplauna (max. 40 mu g/1) Since AD 1950, corroborated by changes in
   sedimentary biogenic silica concentration and organic carbon content.
   Since similar to AD 1970 improved waste water management led to a
   considerable reduction in TP loading in Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da
   San Murezzan.

AB This paper describes variability in trends of annual tree growth at
   several locations in the high latitudes of Eurasia, providing a wide
   regional comparison over a 2000-year period. The study focuses on the
   nature of local and widespread tree-growth responses to recent warming
   seen in instrumental observations, available in northern regions for
   periods ranging from decades to a century. Instrumental temperature data
   demonstrate differences in seasonal scale of Eurasian warming and the
   complexity and spatial diversity of tree-growing-season trends in recent
   decades. A set of long tree-ring chronologies provides empirical
   evidence of association between inter-annual tree growth and local,
   primarily summer, temperature variability at each location. These data
   show no evidence of a recent breakdown in this association as has been
   found at other high-latitude Northern Hemisphere locations. Using
   Kendall's concordance, we quantify the time-dependent relationship
   between growth trends of the long chronologies as a group. This provides
   strong evidence that the extent of recent widespread warming across
   northwest Eurasia, with respect to 100- to 200-year trends, is
   unprecedented in the last 2000 years. An equivalent analysis of
   simulated temperatures using the HadCM3 model fails to show a similar
   increase in concordance expected as a consequence of anthropogenic
   forcing.

   thermal energy that relates directly to an ectotherm's cumulative
   metabolism but is rarely used to describe growth and development in
   fish. We applied GDD to length and maturity data from 416 populations of
   walleye (Sander vitreus) from Ontario and Quebec, Canada (mean annual
   GDD = 1200 to 2300 degrees C.days). On average, males matured after they
   had experienced 6900 degrees C.days and reached 350 mm total length (L)
   (n = 77 populations), and females matured after 10 000 degrees C.days
   and at 450 mm L (n = 70). Across 143 populations, GDD accounted for up
   to 96% of the variation in the length of immature walleye but also
   revealed a twofold difference in growth rate that was indicative of
   variation in food availability. When applied to data from eight
   populations in which walleye abundances have changed dramatically over
   time, GDD revealed a 1.3-fold increase in immature growth rate when
   abundance was low compared with when it was high. Our results both
   demonstrate the explanatory power of GDD with respect to fish growth and
   maturity and inform the development of regional management strategies
   for walleye.

AB Two fundamental issues in ecology are understanding what influences the
   distribution and abundance of organisms through space and time. While it
   is well established that broad-scale patterns of abiotic and biotic
   conditions affect organisms' distributions and population fluctuations,
   discrete events may be important drivers of space use, survival, and
   persistence. These discrete extreme climatic events can constrain
   populations and space use at fine scales beyond that which is typically
   measured in ecological studies. Recently, a growing body of literature
   has identified thermal stress as a potential mechanism in determining
   space use and survival. We sought to determine how ambient temperature
   at fine temporal scales affected survival and space use for a
   ground-nesting quail species (Colinus virginianus; northern bobwhite).
   We modeled space use across an ambient temperature gradient (ranging
   from similar to 20 to 38 degrees C) through a MAXENT algorithm. We also
   used Andersen-Gill proportional hazard models to assess the influence of
   ambient temperature-related variables on survival through time.
   Estimated available useable space ranged from 18.6% to 57.1% of the
   landscape depending on ambient temperature. The lowest and highest
   ambient temperature categories (< -15 degrees C and > 35 degrees C,
   respectively) were associated with the least amount of estimated useable
   space (18.6% and 24.6%, respectively). Range overlap analysis indicated
   dissimilarity in areas where Colinus virginianus were restricted during
   times of thermal extremes (range overlap = 0.38). This suggests that
   habitat under a given condition is not necessarily a habitat under
   alternative conditions. Further, we found survival was most influenced
   by weekly minimum ambient temperatures. Our results demonstrate that
   ecological constraints can occur along a thermal gradient and that
   understanding the effects of these discrete events and how they change
   over time may be more important to conservation of organisms than are
   average and broad-scale conditions as typically measured in ecological
   studies.

AB Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane
   and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in temperature. In
   developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities
   of the microsomal omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and
   FAD3. Although temperature regulation of desaturation has been studied
   at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this
   trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed lipids to variation in ambient
   temperature and found that heat inhibits both omega-6 and omega-3
   desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in
   triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of
   the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed
   that significant natural variation exists in the temperature
   responsiveness of omega-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative
   trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
   using the MAGIC population suggests that omega-6 desaturation is largely
   controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the FAD2 59 untranslated
   region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However,
   the temperature responsiveness of omega-6 desaturation is controlled by
   a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown,
   but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal
   sequence variants within; 40 genes in an; 450-kb region of the QTL.

   a significant physiological challenge to organisms seeking to colonize
   deeper waters or migrate ontogenetically. Pressure may be a key factor
   contributing to bottlenecks in the radiation of taxa and potentially
   drive speciation. Here, we assess shifts in the tolerance of hydrostatic
   pressure through early ontogeny of the northern stone crab Lithodes
   maja, which occupies a depth range of 4-790 m in the North Atlantic. The
   zoea I, megalopa and crab I stages were exposed to hydrostatic pressures
   up to 30.0 MPa (equivalent of 3000 m depth), and the relative fold
   change of genes putatively coding for the N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor-regulated protein 1 (narg gene), two heat-shock protein 70 kDa
   (HSP70) isoforms and mitochondrial Citrate Synthase (CS gene) were
   measured. This study finds a significant increase in the relative
   expression of the CS and hsp70a genes with increased hydrostatic
   pressure in the zoea I stage, and an increase in the relative expression
   of all genes with increased hydrostatic pressure in the megalopa and
   crab I stages. Transcriptional responses are corroborated by patterns in
   respiratory rates in response to hydrostatic pressure in all stages.
   These results suggest a decrease in the acute high-pressure tolerance
   limit as ontogeny advances, as reflected by a shift in the hydrostatic
   pressure at which significant differences are observed.

AB Body melanisation in insects is polygenic, resulting from genetic
   polymorphism or phenotypic plasticity, with diverse implications ranging
   from thermal budgeting to reproductive success. In this study, we
   assessed the, mate choice, reproductive success, and offspring
   colouration of typical (T) and melanic (M) morphs of the ladybird
   Menochilus sexmaculatus paired at three temperatures 15 degrees C, 25
   degrees C and 35 degrees C. Mating success of the two morphs and the
   consequences for offspring fitness and offspring phenotype under these
   temperature regimes were evaluated. Melanic adults of both sexes
   achieved significantly higher mating success at 15 degrees C and 25
   degrees C, but at 35 degrees C no influence of adult morph on mate
   selection was observed. Melanic females were more fecund than typical
   females at all temperatures. Offspring of melanic parents developed
   faster than those of typicals at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but not
   at 35 degrees C. Evidence was also found of phenotypic plasticity in
   colour form at 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C. At 25 degrees C the
   parents of pure (T) and (M) morphs produced offspring of the same morph.
   However, low temperature induced partial melanisation among the
   offspring of typical parents (T). Whereas at 35 degrees C the offspring
   of (T) parents became paler in colour with very fine zigzag lines on
   elytra, i.e. they decrease the degree of melanisation. Pure melanics (M)
   compensated for elevated temperature stress by producing offspring that
   were either pure melanic but small or large with reduced melanisation.
   Our results on offspring phenotype variation indicate that the degree of
   melanism in morphs is a result of environmentally regulated expression
   of the parental genotype. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low
   temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular
   or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for
   their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence
   indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to
   maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function
   and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study
   describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis
   and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at -4 degrees
   C) in the chill-susceptible locust Locusta migratoria. This relationship
   was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening
   treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0 degrees C) to investigate the physiological
   underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K+] and this
   disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion
   homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which
   correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals
   regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The
   present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are
   associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as
   attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K+ (E-K)
   following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement
   once K+ homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (E-K approximate
   to-41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to
   ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of
   haemolymph [K+].

AB Studies of the relationship of performance and behavioral traits with
   environmental factors have tended to neglect interindividual variation
   even though quantification of this variation is fundamental to
   understanding how phenotypic traits can evolve. In ectotherms,
   functional integration of locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and
   energy metabolism is of special interest because of the potential for
   coadaptation among these traits. For this reason, we analyzed
   interindividual variation, covariation, and repeatability of the thermal
   sensitivity of maximal sprint speed, preferred body temperature, thermal
   precision, and resting metabolic rate measured in ca. 200 common lizards
   (Zootoca vivipara) that varied by sex, age, and body size. We found
   significant interindividual variation in selected body temperatures and
   in the thermal performance curve of maximal sprint speed for both the
   intercept (expected trait value at the average temperature) and the
   slope (measure of thermal sensitivity). Interindividual differences in
   maximal sprint speed across temperatures, preferred body temperature,
   and thermal precision were significantly repeatable. A positive
   relationship existed between preferred body temperature and thermal
   precision, implying that individuals selecting higher temperatures were
   more precise. The resting metabolic rate was highly variable but was not
   related to thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed or thermal
   behavior. Thus, locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy
   metabolism were not directly functionally linked in the common lizard.

AB The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the predominant interannual
   pattern of climate variability in the world and may become extreme
   approximately once every 20 years. Climate-forced interannual
   variability in fecundity rates of long-lived species are well-studied,
   but the effect of extreme events is less clear. Here, we analyzed the
   effect of the extreme 2015-16 El Nino event on three long-lived sea
   turtle species in a region highly influenced by ENSO. The effect of this
   extreme event varied considerably among species. While reproductive
   success dramatically declined in leatherback turtles (Dermochelys
   coriacea), the reduction was only marginal in green turtles (Chelonia
   mydas). Nevertheless, the number of nesting green turtles decreased
   following the extreme El Nino event, likely due to decreased ocean
   productivity. We used global climate models to project an increase in
   the decadal occurrence of extreme events from similar to 0.7 events
   (beginning of twentieth century) to similar to 2.9 events per decade
   (end of twenty-first century). This resulted in a projected decline in
   the reproductive success of leatherback turtles (similar to 19%), a
   milder decline in olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (similar
   to 7%), and no decline in green turtles (similar to 1%). Extreme El Nino
   events can have a strong detrimental effect on East Pacific leatherback
   turtles, a population that is already critically endangered due to other
   anthropogenic impacts. Our results highlight the importance of
   conducting species-specific and site-specific analyses of climatic
   impacts on sea turtles.

AB A new design of flowmeter is described and used in a comprehensive study
   of the respiratory and cardiovascular adjustments that occur during a
   standardised exercise test in Thoroughbred horses. The flowmeter system
   and associated lightweight, fibreglass mask (total mass, 0.7 kg) have a
   maximum dead space of 500 ml and negligible resistance to airflow. They
   have no systematic effect on blood gases and, together with a rapidly
   responding mass spectrometer, enable an accurate computation of gas
   exchange to be performed together with breath-by-breath determination of
   other respiratory variables.
   At the highest level of exercise (12 m s-1 on a 3-degrees incline), the
   rate of oxygen uptake (V(02)) and carbon dioxide production (V(CO2))
   increased to 29.4 times and 36.8 times their resting values,
   respectively. Respiratory minute volume (VE) increased to 27.0 times its
   resting value, with respiratory frequency (fR) making the major
   contribution at the walk and trot. However, with increasing cantering
   speeds, fR changed little as it was locked in a 1:1 fashion to stride
   frequency, and tidal volume (VT) then made the major contribution to the
   increase in VE. The ratio of ventilatory dead space (VD) to VT in
   resting horses was lower than that previously reported in the literature
   and this could be the result of the different respiratory recording
   systems that were used. There was a close relationship between VT and
   stride length at increasing cantering speeds.
   Despite the fact that alveolar ventilation (VA) was well matched to
   V(O2), there was a significant reduction in arterial P(O2) (Pa(O2)) when
   the horses cantered at 8 m s-1 and this eventually fell to 34 % below
   the resting value. The present data tend to support the idea that VA/Vb
   (where Vb is cardiac output) inequalities are important in causing this
   hypoxaemia. However, the reduction in Pa(O2) was more than compensated
   for by an increase in haemoglobin concentration, [Hb], so the
   concentration of oxygen in the arterial blood (Ca(O2)) was significantly
   above the resting value at all levels of exercise. Both lactate
   concentration and Pa(CO2) increased during exercise, causing substantial
   reductions in pH of both arterial and mixed venous blood. This would
   have inevitably shifted the oxygen equilibrium curve of the Hb to the
   right, desaturating the arterial blood and thus exacerbating the effect
   of the hypoxaemia, as would the almost 4-degrees-C rise in blood
   temperature. The tight respiratory/locomotor linkage might prevent the
   acidosis and hyperthermia having the stimulatory effects on VE that they
   have in humans at high work loads.
   Cardiac output and heart rate (Vb) were 5 and 6 times their-resting
   values, respectively, at the highest level of exercise, while cardiac
   stroke volume did not change significantly. There was both systemic and
   pulmonary hypertension. with mean pulmonary blood pressure reaching 2.6
   times its resting value at the highest level of exercise. It is
   concluded that the pulmonary hypertension does not result from the
   hypoxaemia and that it could cause pulmonary oedema, which could
   contribute to the postulated diffusion limitation of the lungs during
   exercise.
   Although this report confirms some results obtained by other workers,
   some discrepancies have been found. It is probable that the flowmeter
   and mask used here have a significantly reduced effect on the measured
   variables compared with methods used in many of the previous studies.

AB The hypothesis of oxygen limitation of thermal tolerance proposes that
   critical temperatures are set by a transition to anaerobic metabolism,
   and that upper and lower tolerances are therefore coupled. Moreover,
   this hypothesis has been dubbed a unifying general principle and
   extended from marine to terrestrial ectotherms. By contrast, in insects
   the upper and lower limits are decoupled, suggesting that the oxygen
   limitation hypothesis might not be as general as proposed. However, no
   direct tests of this hypothesis or its predictions have been undertaken
   in terrestrial species. We use a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium
   vulgare) and a tenebrionid beetle (Gonocephalum simplex) to test the
   prediction that thermal tolerance should vary with oxygen partial
   pressure. Whilst in the isopod critical thermal maximum declined with
   declining oxygen concentration, this was not the case in the beetle.
   Efficient oxygen delivery via a tracheal system makes oxygen limitation
   of thermal tolerance, at a whole organism level, unlikely in insects. By
   contrast, oxygen limitation of thermal tolerances is expected to apply
   to species, like the isopod, in which the circulatory system contributes
   significantly to oxygen delivery. Because insects dominate terrestrial
   systems, oxygen limitation of thermal tolerance cannot be considered
   pervasive in this habitat, although it is a characteristic of marine
   species.

AB Several environmental indicators show that climate changed dramatically
   at the turn of the 19th century, with global warming throughout the 20th
   century. Among the most used proxies to evaluate long-term changes in
   climate are trees located at their northern range limit. Several studies
   have shown enhanced tree regeneration at treeline caused by recent
   warming, but no data are available on height growth performance of
   forest trees at treeline before and during the 20th century warmth. In
   this study, we examined the long-term growth performance of black spruce
   (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) trees located in a lichen-spruce
   woodland, near the arctic treeline in eastern Canada. The study woodland
   is an old-growth stand that has escaped fire approximately during the
   past two millennia. We performed stem analysis on normally developed
   trees which grew in the woodland over the last centuries. The sampled
   trees are ramets from long-lived, self-regenerating black spruce clones
   that are forming small tree islands within the woodland. The
   co-occurrence of living and dead tree stems inside clones gives the
   opportunity to evaluate the growth performance of the same genets
   through time. Height and radial growth of 60 tree stems from 15
   old-growth clones were evaluated for a period spanning the last 400 yr.
   Sampling included the two tallest living stems and the two tallest dead
   stems of randomly selected clones. No differences in height and radial
   growth were found among the 30 living stems nor among the 30 dead stems
   within clones. Living stems were 2 m taller and radial growth was 1.6
   times greater than dead stems. Vertical development of stems was divided
   into two parts according to position of snow cover. Growth of dead and
   living stems was similar below the snowpack line. However, significant
   differences were found for growth above snowpack for the two types of
   stems. Growth above snow cover for all dead stems occurred between the
   17th and 19th centuries. In contrast, growth of living stems above snow
   cover started during the late 19th century. Our data indicate that stems
   of the same genotype responded directly to climate change, in
   conjunction with climatic conditions prevailing at the time when they
   were protruding above the snowpack. Compared to extant trees,
   significantly smaller trees grew in the woodland during the Little Ice
   Age. Potential causal factors of differential growth performance through
   time are discussed.

AB Quantitative tools for deciphering the environment of microbialite
   formation are relatively limited. For example, the oxygen isotope
   carbonate-water geothermometer requires assumptions about the isotopic
   composition of the water of formation. We explored the utility of using
   'clumped' isotope thermometry as a tool to study the temperatures of
   microbialite formation. We studied microbialites recovered from water
   depths of 10-55 m in Pavilion Lake, and 10-25 m in Kelly Lake, spanning
   the thermocline in both lakes. We determined the temperature of
   carbonate growth and the O-18/O-16 ratio of the waters that
   microbialites grew in. Results were then compared to current
   limnological data from the lakes to reconstruct the history of
   microbialite formation. Modern microbialites collected at shallow depths
   (11.7 m) in both lakes yield clumped isotope-based temperatures of
   formation that are within error of summer water temperatures, suggesting
   that clumped isotope analyses may be used to reconstruct past climates
   and to probe the environments in which microbialites formed. The deepest
   microbialites (21.7-55 m) were recovered from below the present-day
   thermoclines in both lakes and yield radioisotope ages indicating they
   primarily formed earlier in the Holocene. During this time, pollen data
   and our reconstructed water O-18/O-16 ratios indicate a period of
   aridity, with lower lake levels. At present, there is a close
   association between both photosynthetic and heterotrophic communities,
   and carbonate precipitation/microbialite formation, with biosignatures
   of photosynthetic influences on carbonate detected in microbialites from
   the photic zone and above the thermocline (i.e., depths of generally <20
   m). Given the deeper microbialites are receiving <1% of
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it is likely these
   microbialites primarily formed when lower lake levels resulted in
   microbialites being located higher in the photic zone, in warm surface
   waters.

AB BackgroundThe climate variables that directly influence vector-borne
   diseases' ecosystems are mainly temperature and rainfall. This is not
   only because the vectors bionomics are strongly dependent upon these
   variables, but also because most of the elements of the systems are
   impacted, such as the host behavior and development and the pathogen
   amplification. The impact of the climate changes on the transmission
   patterns of these diseases is not easily understood, since many
   confounding factors are acting together. Consequently, knowledge of
   these impacts is often based on hypothesis derived from mathematical
   models. Nevertheless, some direct evidences can be found for several
   vector-borne diseases.Main bodyEvidences of the impact of climate change
   are available for malaria, arbovirus diseases such as dengue, and many
   other parasitic and viral diseases such as Rift Valley Fever, Japanese
   encephalitis, human African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. The
   effect of temperature and rainfall change as well as extreme events,
   were found to be the main cause for outbreaks and are alarming the
   global community. Among the main driving factors, climate strongly
   influences the geographical distribution of insect vectors, which is
   rapidly changing due to climate change. Further, in both models and
   direct evidences, climate change is seen to be affecting vector-borne
   diseases more strikingly in fringe of different climatic areas often in
   the border of transmission zones, which were once free of these diseases
   with human populations less immune and more receptive. The impact of
   climate change is also more devastating because of the unpreparedness of
   Public Health systems to provide adequate response to the events, even
   when climatic warning is available. Although evidences are strong at the
   regional and local levels, the studies on impact of climate change on
   vector-borne diseases and health are producing contradictory results at
   the global level.ConclusionsIn this paper we discuss the current state
   of the results and draw on evidences from malaria, dengue and other
   vector-borne diseases to illustrate the state of current thinking and
   outline the need for further research to inform our predictions and
   response.

AB Founding isofemale lines from wild collected females is a basic tool for
   investigating the genetic architecture of Drosophila natural
   populations. The method permits the analysis of quantitative traits
   under laboratory conditions, with a much broader scope than the mere
   evidence of a significant genetic heterogeneity among lines. Genetic
   variability is generally demonstrated by a significant coefficient of
   intraclass correlation, but several experimental precautions are needed
   and explained here. The relationship between classical ( additive)
   heritability and intraclass correlation is not straightforward,
   presumably because the genetic bottlenecks due to the initiation of the
   lines unravel a significant, nonadditive genetic variance due to
   dominance and epistatic effects. It is thus suggested to consider
   intraclass correlation as a specific genetic parameter that enables
   comparisons between different traits, different populations or different
   environments. The use of isofemale lines is, however, not restricted to
   the calculation of an intraclass correlation. It can be used to estimate
   genetic correlations among traits or environments. The method is also
   convenient for the analysis of phenotypic plasticity in relation to an
   environmental gradient. A precise description of the response curves (
   the reaction norms) is possible, distinguishing trait parameters and
   plasticity parameters. A fairly general conclusion is that, for a given
   trait, mean value and plasticity are genetically independent. It is also
   possible to analyze traits, which, like sexual dimorphism, must be
   measured on different individuals, and even to demonstrate their genetic
   variability. In many cases, further empirical and theoretical analyses
   are possible and needed. It is argued that, in the future, isofemale
   lines will have an increasing significance among the various techniques

AB Understanding niche evolution, dynamics, and the response of species to
   climate change requires knowledge of the determinants of the
   environmental niche and species range limits. Mean values of climatic
   variables are often used in such analyses. In contrast, the increasing
   frequency of climate extremes suggests the importance of understanding
   their additional influence on range limits. Here, we assess how measures
   representing climate extremes (i.e., interannual variability in climate
   parameters) explain and predict spatial patterns of 11 tree species in
   Switzerland. We find clear, although comparably small, improvement (+20%
   in adjusted D-2, +8% and +3% in cross-validated True Skill Statistic and
   area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values) in
   models that use measures of extremes in addition to means. The primary
   effect of including information on climate extremes is a correction of
   local overprediction and underprediction. Our results demonstrate that
   measures of climate extremes are important for understanding the
   climatic limits of tree species and assessing species niche
   characteristics. The inclusion of climate variability likely will
   improve models of species range limits under future conditions, where
   changes in mean climate and increased variability are expected.

AB A wide variety of cell biological and biomimetic systems use actin
   polymerization to drive motility. It has been suggested that an object
   such as a bacterium can propel itself by self-assembling a high
   concentration of actin behind it, if it is repelled by actin. However,
   it is also known that it is essential for the moving object to bind
   actin. Therefore, a key question is how the actin tail can propel an
   object when it both binds and repels the object. We present a physically
   consistent Brownian dynamics model for actin-based motility that
   includes the minimal components of the dendritic nucleation model and
   allows for both attractive and repulsive interactions between actin and
   a moveable disc. We find that the concentration gradient of filamentous
   actin generated by polymerization is sufficient to propel the object,
   even with moderately strong binding interactions. Additionally, actin
   binding can act as a biophysical cap, and may directly control motility
   through modulation of network growth. Overall, this mechanism is robust
   in that it can drive motility against a load up to a stall pressure that
   depends on the Young's modulus of the actin network and can explain
   several aspects of actin-based motility.

AB Our current knowledge on climate-mediated effects on human population
   dynamics is based on preindustrial agrarian societies where
   climate-induced crop failures had a major impact on fertility and
   mortality rates. However, because most of the human evolutionary history
   has been shaped by hunter-gatherer lifestyle relying on diverse plant
   and animal food sources, it is also important to understand how climate
   affected the population dynamics of hunter-gatherers. We thus studied
   whether climate, measured as a reconstructed annual mean temperature,
   had concurrent or delayed effects on the key components of population
   dynamics, annual births and deaths, in three historical (1722-1850) Sami
   populations of Northern Finland that depended mainly on fishing,
   hunting, and reindeer herding for their livelihood. We found only weak
   concurrent effects of mean temperature on annual births and deaths,
   although in general warm years correlated with increased birth and
   reduced mortality rates. Likewise, temperature-mediated delayed effects
   were mainly absent: in one population only, a warm previous year tended
   to reduce the number of births. By contrast, annual numbers of births
   and deaths were more closely associated, as indicated by negative
   correlations between births and deaths up to three previous years. To
   summarize, in contrast to historical agrarian societies, the population
   dynamics of historical Sami seemed to be only weakly associated with
   annual mean temperature, which may indicate that these populations,
   probably due to their dietary breadth, were rather unaffected by
   climatic variation.

AB Hygienic behavior, i.e. the removal of diseased or damaged brood by
   worker honey bees (Apis mellifera), is seen as one of the principal
   behavioral elements of this species' social immunity. Identification of
   the stimuli that trigger it would be helpful in searching for
   biochemical and molecular markers of this important breeding trait.
   While many studies at the genomic, transcriptomic, and behavioral level
   have pointed to the implication of chemical cues, we here hypothesized
   that thermal cues are alternatively/additionally involved. To test this
   hypothesis, we first measured whether infestation by the mite Varroa
   destructor (a condition known to induce hygienic behavior) leads to a
   thermal gradient between affected and unaffected brood. We found that
   infested brood cells were between 0.03 and 0.19 degrees C warmer than
   uninfested controls. Next, we tested whether artificially heating an
   area of a brood comb would increase the removal of infested or
   uninfested brood as compared to an unheated control area, and found that
   this was not the case. Finally, we investigated whether the heating of
   individual brood cells, as opposed to comb areas, would influence brood
   removal from cells adjacent to the heated one. This was the case for
   uninfested, though not for infested cells. We conclude that infestation
   by V. destructor leads to a heating of brood cells that should be
   perceivable by bees, and that small-scale temperature gradients can
   influence brood removal. This makes it appear possible that thermal cues
   play a role in triggering hygienic behavior of honey bees directed at
   varroa-infested larvae/pupae, although our results are insufficient to
   prove such an involvement.

AB The Holocene lake history, vegetation history and climate history of
   Brurskardstjorni, an alpine lake in the Jotunheimen Mountains of
   south-central Norway, are reconstructed. The reconstructions are based
   on fossil pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, chironomids and sediment
   characteristics. Subsequent to deglaciation, the lake was formed at
   about 11,000 cal years BP. A diverse chironomid assemblage quickly
   colonised the lake, whereas the first diatoms were found about 400 years
   later. At that time, the lake water was turbid with a high pH. The
   surrounding soils were immature and unstable and dominated by open
   pioneer vegetation. Compared to the present, summer temperatures were
   warmer and there was less winter precipitation. From about 10,000 cal
   years BP, local organic production increased rapidly and from about
   9,500 cal years BP a few macrofossils and a high pollen influx of birch
   suggest that the tree-line was close to the lake. Pine most likely
   reached its highest tree-line altitude around 9,000 cal years BP and has
   receded since that time. From about 5,000 cal years BP, the total amount
   of trees and shrubs decreased and the landscape became more open,
   probably due to decreasing temperatures and increasing effective
   moisture lowering the birch tree-line. Coinciding with a cooling during
   the last 3,000 years, lake-water pH decreased. There is large
   incongruence between the Holocene July temperatures inferred from pollen
   and chironomids. The biological proxies responded to a combined effect
   of environmental change and biotic interactions. This response is
   interpreted with reference to taxon-environment relationships in the
   modern calibration data sets and with reference to the latent structure
   and ecological demands of the fossil assemblages.

AB Thermal properties of nests have been investigated using a variety of
   techniques. Infrared (IR) thermography has the advantage of being a
   non-invasive technique allowing the integrity of the nest wall to be
   retained during measurement. This study investigated the insulative
   properties of nests of the Eurasian Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), the
   Common Blackbird (Turdus merula) and the Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos)
   using IR thermography. Nests were inverted over a heat source and the
   temperature of the external nest surface was recorded. Bullfinch nests
   were less insulated than thrush nests. Including foil inside the nest
   cup decreased the amount of convection through the open walls of
   Bullfinch nests. Removal of the outer nest and cup lining of thrush
   nests only slightly decreased the degree of insulation offered by the
   nest indicating an important insulative role for the substantial 'mud
   cup' in these nests. The results suggested that the nest wall is not
   sealed and convection currents may a play a significant role in nest
   insulation. In conjunction with a steady-state heat source IR
   thermography is useful in assessing the insulative properties of bird
   nests.

AB Intense El Nino events severely impact seabird populations, often months
   in advance of peak temperature anomalies. The trophic mechanisms
   responsible for these impacts are unknown but are assumed to operate at
   seasonal scales and to be linked to ocean productivity changes.
   Precursors to El Nino events include changes in both sea-surface
   temperature and the depth of the 20 degrees C thermocline. Foraging
   piscivorous seabirds are known to be sensitive to both thermocline depth
   and sea-surface temperature change, but the potential influence of these
   phenomena on breeding dynamics is unknown. Using 18 years of data on
   three seabirds of the western tropical Pacific, we show that pelagic
   seabird breeding participation is directly and independently related to
   changes in both surface chlorophyll concentration and thermocline depth
   that occur well in advance of El Nino generated sea-surface temperature
   anomalies. In contrast, breeding in an inshore foraging species is not
   correlated with any environmental/biological parameters investigated.
   These findings demonstrate that El Nino related phenomena do not affect
   seabird prey dynamics solely via productivity shifts at seasonal scales,
   nor in similar ways across different seabird foraging guilds. Our
   results also suggest that population declines observed in the western
   tropical Pacific may be directly related to the frequency and intensity
   of El Nino anomalies over the study period.

AB Question: How can we derive baseline/reference situations to evaluate
   the impact of global change on terrestrial ecosystem functioning?
   Location: Main biomes (steppes to rain forests) of Argentina.
   Methods: We used AVHRR/NOAA satellite data to characterize vegetation
   functioning. We used the seasonal dynamics of the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), a linear estimator of the fraction of the
   photosynthetic active radiation intercepted by vegetation (f(PAR)), and
   the surface temperature (Ts), for the period 1981-1993. We extracted the
   following indices: NDVI integral (NDVI-I), NDVI relative range (R-rel),
   NDVI maximum value (V-max), date of maximum NDVI (D-max) and actual
   evapotranspiration.
   Results: f(PAR) varied from 2 to 80%, in relation to changes in wnet
   primary production (NPP) from 83 to 1700 g.m(-2).yr(-1). NDVI-I, Vmax
   and f(PAR) had positive, curvilinear relationships to mean annual
   precipitation (MAP), NPP was linearly related to MAP. Tropical and
   subtropical biomes had a significantly lower seasonality (R-rel) than
   temperate ones. D-max was not correlated with the defined environmental
   gradients. Evapo-transpiration ranged from 100 to 1100 mm.yr(-1).
   Interannual variability of NDVI attributes varied across the temperature
   and precipitation gradients.
   Conclusions: Our results may be used to represent baseline conditions in
   evaluating the impact of land use changes across environmental
   gradients. The relationships between functional, attributes and
   environmental variables provide a way to extrapolate ecological patterns
   from protected areas across modified habitats and to generate maps of
   ecosystem functioning.

AB Plant shoot tips do not survive exposure to liquid nitrogen temperatures

   as plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2), dehydrate cells and decrease
   lethal ice formation, but the extent of dehydration and the effect on
   water freezing properties are not known. We examined the effect of a
   PVS2 cryoprotection protocol on the water content and phase behavior of
   mint and garlic shoot tips using differential scanning calorimetry. The
   temperature and enthalpy of water melting transitions in unprotected and
   recovering shoot tips were comparable to dilute aqueous solutions.
   Exposure to PVS2 changed the behavior of water in shoot tips: enthalpy
   of melting transitions decreased to about 40 J g H2O-1 (compared to 333
   J g H2O-1 for pure H2O), amount of unfrozen water increased to similar
   to 0.7 g H2O g dry mass(-1) (compared to similar to 0.4 g H2O g dry
   mass(-1) for unprotected shoot tips), and a glass transition (T-g) at -
   115 degrees C was apparent. Evaporative drying at room temperature was
   slower in PVS2-treated shoot tips compared to shoot tips receiving no
   cryoprotection treatments. We quantified the extent that ethylene glycol
   and dimethyl sulfoxide components permeate into shoot tips and replace
   some of the water. Since T-g in PVS2-treated shoot tips occurs at - 115
   degrees C, mechanisms other than glass formation prevent freezing at
   temperatures between 0 and - 115 degrees C. Protection is likely a
   result of controlled dehydration or altered thermal properties of
   intracellular water. A comparison of thermodynamic measurements for
   cryoprotection solutions in diverse plant systems will identify efficacy
   among cryopreservation protocols. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   middle-term (including the swim-up larval and pelagic juvenile stages),
   and late-term (over the benthic juvenile stage) on recruitment by yellow
   perch (Perca flavescens) in the western basin of Lake Erie between 1999
   and 2013. Variation of recruitment was mainly driven by middle-term
   effects. Then, abiotic factors, such as warming rate and wind speed,
   more strongly affected recruitment than did biotic factors. Among
   middle-term biotic factors, the top-down effect of yearling walleye
   (Sander vitreus) abundance was stronger than the bottom-up effect of
   zooplankton abundance. Similar to marine species, physical processes
   appear to strongly affect recruitment dynamics of Lake Erie yellow perch
   over its pelagic larval and juvenile stages, demonstrating the
   importance of physical and biological processes in understanding fish

AB Metabolic cold adaptation (MCA), the hypothesis that species from cold
   climates have relatively higher metabolic rates than those from warm
   climates, was first proposed nearly 100 years ago and remains one of the
   most controversial hypotheses in physiological ecology. In the present
   study, we test the MCA hypothesis in fishes at the level of whole
   animal, mitochondria and enzyme. In support of the MCA hypothesis, we
   find that when normalized to a common temperature, species with ranges
   that extend to high latitude (cooler climates) have high aerobic enzyme
   (citrate synthase) activity, high rates of mitochondrial respiration and
   high standard metabolic rates. Metabolic compensation for the global
   temperature gradient is not complete however, so when measured at their
   habitat temperature species from high latitude have lower absolute rates
   of metabolism than species from low latitudes. Evolutionary adaptation
   and thermal plasticity are therefore insufficient to completely overcome
   the acute thermodynamic effects of temperature, at least in fishes.

AB Objectives: Small-bodied folivores are rare because processing leaves
   often requires extensive gut adaptations and lengthy retention times for
   fiber fermentation. However, the <1 kg nocturnal white-footed sportive
   lemurs (Lepilemur leucopus) persist on a leaf-based diet. We
   investigated how extrinsic (i.e., seasonality in temperature and food
   availability) and intrinsic factors (i.e., reproductive state) influence
   nutrient intake and explored how nutrient and energy needs are met in
   this species.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted full night focal follows across all
   seasons and analyzed nutrients in all items eaten by adults of both
   sexes to investigate nutrient intake and nutritional priorities in L.
   leucopus. We estimated digestible protein content, as this is a
   biologically more meaningful measure than crude protein.
   Results: Protein intake was constant across seasons, while non-protein
   energy and dry matter intake increased from the hot wet to the cold dry
   season. Males and females did not differ in their nutrient or apparent
   energy intake irrespective of female reproductive state.
   Discussion: We conclude that these animals prioritize protein over
   non-protein energy intake as dietary protein is in limited supply, and
   that thermoregulation poses higher energetic costs than reproduction in
   this species. While protein intake did not differ across female
   reproductive states, the relative protein content of the diet was
   highest during the lactation period, indicating that the balance of
   non-protein to protein intake may be more important than absolute
   intake. Dry matter intake was high compared to other folivorous
   primates, indicating that L. leucopus follows an intake rather than an
   efficiency strategy to meet its energy requirements. (C) 2016 Wiley

AB Although temperature is an important driver of seasonal changes in
   photosynthetic physiology, photoperiod also regulates leaf activity.
   Climate change will extend growing seasons if temperature cues
   predominate, but photoperiod-controlled species will show limited
   responsiveness to warming. We show that photoperiod explains more
   seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23 tree species
   than temperature. Although leaves remain green, photosynthetic capacity
   peaks just after summer solstice and declines with decreasing
   photoperiod, before air temperatures peak. In support of these findings,
   saplings grown at constant temperature but exposed to an extended
   photoperiod maintained high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic
   activity declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening
   photoperiod; leaves remained equally green in both treatments.
   Incorporating a photoperiodic correction of photosynthetic physiology
   into a global-scale terrestrial carbon-cycle model significantly
   improves predictions of seasonal atmospheric CO2 cycling, demonstrating
   the benefit of such a function in coupled climate system models.
   Accounting for photo-period-induced seasonality in photosynthetic
   parameters reduces modeled global gross primary production 2.5% (similar
   to 4 PgC y(-1)), resulting in a >3% (similar to 2 PgC y(-1)) decrease of
   net primary production. Such a correction is also needed in models
   estimating current carbon uptake based on remotely sensed greenness.
   Photoperiod-associated declines in photosynthetic capacity could limit
   autumn carbon gain in forests, even if warming delays leaf senescence.

AB Plants that constitutively express otherwise inducible disease
   resistance traits often suffer a depressed seed yield in the absence of
   a challenge by pathogens. This has led to the view that inducible
   disease resistance is indispensable, ensuring that minimal resources are
   diverted from growth, reproduction and abiotic stress tolerance. The
   Arabidopsis genotype C24 has enhanced basal resistance, which was shown
   to be caused by permanent expression of normally inducible salicylic
   acid (SA)-regulated defences. However, the seed yield of C24 was greatly
   enhanced in comparison to disease-resistant mutants that display
   identical expression of SA defences. Under both water-replete and
   -limited conditions, C24 showed no difference and increased seed yield,
   respectively, in comparison with pathogen-susceptible genotypes. C24 was
   the most drought-tolerant genotype and showed elevated water
   productivity, defined as seed yield per plant per millilitre water
   consumed, and achieved this by displaying adjustments to both its
   development and transpiration efficiency (TE). Therefore, constitutive
   high levels of disease resistance in C24 do not affect drought
   tolerance, seed yield and seed viability. This study demonstrates that
   it will be possible to combine traits that elevate basal disease
   resistance and improve water productivity in crop species, and such
   traits need not be mutually exclusive.

AB Functional trait variation within and across populations can strongly
   influence population, community, and ecosystem processes, but the
   relative contributions of genetic vs. environmental factors to this
   variation are often not clear, potentially complicating conservation and
   restoration efforts. For example, local adaptation, a particular type of
   genetic by environmental (G*E) interaction in which the fitness of a
   population in its own habitat is greater than in other habitats, is
   often invoked in management practices, even in the absence of supporting
   evidence. Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E
   interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and
   environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial
   consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few
   studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation
   from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a
   reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster
   (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three
   field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both
   the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this
   economically valuable and ecologically important species. We documented
   significant G*E variation in survival and growth, yet there was no
   evidence for local adaptation. Condition varied across oyster cohorts:
   Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring
   from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern
   Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet
   offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth
   than those from farther away. In the absence of population-specific
   performance information, oyster restoration and aquaculture may benefit
   from incorporating multiple populations into their practices.

AB The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the fastest rates of
   regional climate change on Earth, resulting in the collapse of ice
   shelves, the retreat of glaciers and the exposure of new terrestrial
   habitat. In the nearby oceanic system, winter sea ice in the
   Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas has decreased in extent by 10% per
   decade, and shortened in seasonal duration. Surface waters have warmed
   by more than 1 K since the 1950s, and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)
   of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also warmed. Of the changes
   observed in the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula
   (WAP) region to date, alterations in winter sea ice dynamics are the
   most likely to have had a direct impact on the marine fauna, principally
   through shifts in the extent and timing of habitat for ice-associated
   biota. Warming of seawater at depths below ca 100 m has yet to reach the
   levels that are biologically significant. Continued warming, or a change
   in the frequency of the flooding of CDW onto the WAP continental shelf
   may, however, induce sublethal effects that influence ecological
   interactions and hence food-web operation. The best evidence for recent
   changes in the ecosystem may come from organisms which record aspects of
   their population dynamics in their skeleton (such as molluscs or
   brachiopods) or where ecological interactions are preserved (such as in
   encrusting biota of hard substrata). In addition, a southwards shift of
   marine isotherms may induce a parallel migration of some taxa similar to
   that observed on land. The complexity of the Southern Ocean food web and
   the nonlinear nature of many interactions mean that predictions based on
   short-term studies of a small number of species are likely to be
   misleading.

AB The rice local population was clearly differentiated into six groups
   over the 100-year history of rice breeding programs in the northern
   limit of rice cultivation over the world.
   Genetic improvements in plant breeding programs in local regions have
   led to the development of new cultivars with specific agronomic traits
   under environmental conditions and generated the unique genetic
   structures of local populations. Understanding historical changes in
   genome structures and phenotypic characteristics within local
   populations may be useful for identifying profitable genes and/or
   genetic resources and the creation of new gene combinations in plant
   breeding programs. In the present study, historical changes were
   elucidated in genome structures and phenotypic characteristics during
   100-year rice breeding programs in Hokkaido, the northern limit of rice
   cultivation in the world. We selected 63 rice cultivars to represent the
   historical diversity of this local population from landraces to the
   current breeding lines. The results of the phylogenetic analysis
   demonstrated that these cultivars clearly differentiated into six groups
   over the history of rice breeding programs. Significant differences
   among these groups were detected in five of the seven traits, indicating
   that the differentiation of the Hokkaido rice population into these
   groups was correlated with these phenotypic changes. These results
   demonstrated that breeding practices in Hokkaido have created new
   genetic structures for adaptability to specific environmental conditions
   and breeding objectives. They also provide a new strategy for rice
   breeding programs in which such unique genes in local populations in the
   world can explore the genetic potentials of the local populations.

   approximately 22,000 unique sequences was used to profile transcriptome
   changes in the first day after transfer of seeds from constant to
   alternating temperature conditions. Functional classification based on
   MIPS and gene ontology revealed active metabolism including
   up-regulation of energy, protein synthesis, and signal transduction
   processes. Down-regulated processes included translation elongation,
   translation, and some biosynthetic processes. Subnetwork analysis
   identified genes involved in abscisic acid, sugar, and circadian clock
   signaling as key regulators of physiological activity in seeds soon
   after the transfer to alternating conditions.

AB In the early 1960s, the population of White Sea marine three-spined
   stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a key forage fish, declined
   drastically, and the species almost completely disappeared from catches.
   The population started to recover in the late 1990s, and its abundance
   has increased exponentially since then. Using contemporary and
   historical data, we contrast the age structure of spawning stock and
   fish growth before and after the population decline. Most stickleback
   spawners in 2009-2011 were 2 and 3 years old, with the 3-year-old fish
   being more abundant. The proportion of 2-year-old fish in recent catches
   is higher than that 50 years ago, indicating some rejuvenation of the
   population after the prolonged decline. Moreover, White Sea sticklebacks
   in the present population grow faster than those in the 1950s. The
   observed shifts are concurrent with the long-term changes in the
   temperature regime in the coastal areas of the White Sea, which
   determine zooplankton abundance and the duration of the feeding season
   of fish. The variation in life-history traits among both anadromous and
   marine stickleback populations within a distribution range was examined.
   The stickleback showed a considerable interpopulation variation in
   growth, longevity and age/size at maturity, which appeared generally
   related to thermal conditions at the marine feeding areas.

   environmental interactions with ECQ, using 237 recombinant inbred lines
   (RILs) derived from a cross between indica cultivars Huahui 3 and
   Zhongguoxiangdao. Sixty-six QTLs were found across 2 years, of which 17
   loci were detected in both years. No QTL was detected at the Wx locus,
   possibly because of allelism between the parents. A QTL cluster in the
   interval ALK6-RM549 on chromosome 6 had the largest effect on alkali
   spreading value, pasting time, time needed from initial viscosity
   increase to peak viscosity, pasting temperature, temperature needed from
   initial viscosity increase to peak viscosity, and pasting viscosity, and
   a minor effect on six traits (parameters): gel consistency, amylose
   content, peak viscosity, cool paste viscosity, breakdown viscosity and
   setback viscosity. Moreover, the Alk gene was responsible for two traits
   studied for the first time, namely peak temperature and pasting
   viscosity, controlled by QTLs qBAtime6 and qVA6, respectively. QTL
   clusters on other chromosomes showed similar characteristics to the Alk
   locus, although the variations explained were relatively minor. The
   OsBEIIb gene locus is linked to the interval RM301-RM424, which defined
   an important QTL cluster on chromosome 2. Moreover, a study using the
   same RIL population showed that a QTL for protein content and Rapid
   Visco Analyzer parameters was tightly linked to the same gene and
   directly affected ECQ. These findings not only demonstrate the
   complexity of ECQ, but also have important implications for map-based
   cloning of the underlying genetic factors and for breeding for rice
   quality.

AB In plants from temperate climates such as Arabidopsis thaliana, low,
   non-freezing temperatures lead to increased freezing tolerance in a
   process termed cold acclimation. During cold acclimation, massive
   changes in gene expression and in the content of primary metabolites and
   lipids have been observed. Here, we have analysed the influence of cold
   acclimation on flavonol and anthocyanin content and on the expression of
   genes related to flavonoid metabolism in 54 Arabidopsis accessions
   covering a wide range of freezing tolerance. Most flavonols and
   anthocyanins accumulated upon cold exposure, but the extent of
   accumulation varied strongly among the accessions. This was also true
   for most of the investigated transcripts. Correlation analyses revealed
   a high degree of coordination among metabolites and among transcripts,
   but only little correlation between metabolites and transcripts,
   indicating an important role of post-transcriptional regulation in
   flavonoid metabolism. Similarly, levels of many flavonoid biosynthesis
   genes were correlated with freezing tolerance after cold acclimation,
   but only the pool sizes of a few flavonols and anthocyanins.
   Collectively, our data provide evidence for an important role of
   flavonoid metabolism in Arabidopsis freezing tolerance and point to the
   importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of
   flavonoid metabolism in response to cold.
   It is well known that acclimation of plants to low temperatures elicits
   massive changes in gene expression and in the content of primary
   metabolites and lipids, but changes in secondary metabolites have not
   been characterized previously. We have analyzed the effect of cold on
   flavonol and anthocyanin content and on the expression of genes related
   to flavonoid metabolism in 54 Arabidopsis accessions covering a wide
   range of freezing tolerance. Most flavonols, anthocyanins and the
   related transcripts accumulated in the cold and for some, a correlation
   of pool sizes with freezing tolerance was found. There was little
   correlation between metabolite and transcript levels, indicating an
   important role of post-transcriptional regulation in flavonoid
   metabolism.

AB Environmental anomalies that trigger adverse physiological responses and
   mortality are occurring with increasing frequency due to climate change.
   At species' range peripheries, environmental anomalies are particularly
   concerning because species often exist at their environmental tolerance
   limits and may not be able to migrate to escape unfavourable conditions.
   Here, we investigated the bleaching response and mortality of 14 coral
   genera across high-latitude eastern Australia during a global heat
   stress event in 2016. We evaluated whether the severity of
   assemblage-scale and genus-level bleaching responses was associated with
   cumulative heat stress and/or local environmental history, including
   long-term mean temperatures during the hottest month of each year
   (SSTLTMAX), and annual fluctuations in water temperature (SSTVAR) and
   solar irradiance (PARZ(VAR)). The most severely-bleached genera included
   species that were either endemic to the region (Pocillopora aliciae) or
   rare in the tropics (e.g. Porites heronensis). Pocillopora spp., in
   particular, showed high rates of immediate mortality. Bleaching severity
   of Pocillopora was high where SSTLTMAX was low or PARZ(VAR) was high,
   whereas bleaching severity of Porites was directly associated with
   cumulative heat stress. While many tropical Acropora species are
   extremely vulnerable to bleaching, the Acropora species common at high
   latitudes, such as A. glauca and A. solitaryensis, showed little
   incidence of bleaching and immediate mortality. Two other
   regionally-abundant genera, Goniastrea and Turbinaria, were also largely
   unaffected by the thermal anomaly. The severity of assemblage-scale
   bleaching responses was poorly explained by the environmental parameters
   we examined. Instead, the severity of assemblage-scale bleaching was
   associated with local differences in species abundance and
   taxon-specific bleaching responses. The marked taxonomic disparity in
   bleaching severity, coupled with high mortality of high-latitude
   endemics, point to climate-driven simplification of assemblage
   structures and progressive homogenisation of reef functions at these
   high-latitude locations.

AB Coral reefs are the most diverse marine ecosystem and embrace possibly
   millions of plant, animal and protist species. Mutualistic symbioses are
   a fundamental feature of coral reefs that have been used to explain
   their structure, biodiversity and existence. Complex inter-relationships
   between hosts, habitats and symbionts belie closely coupled nutrient and
   community dynamics that create the circumstances for "something from
   nothing" (or the "oasis in a nutrient desert"). The flip side of these
   dynamics is a close dependency between species, which results in a
   series of non-linear relationships as conditions change. These responses
   are being highlighted as anthropogenic influences increase across the
   world's tropical and subtropical coastlines. Caribbean as well as
   Indo-Pacific coral populations are now in a serious decline in many
   parts of the world. This has resulted in a significant reorganization of
   how coral reef ecosystems function. Among the spectra of changes brought
   about by humans is rapid climate change. Mass coral bleaching - the loss
   of the dinoflagellate symbionts from reef-building corals - and
   mortality has affected the world's coral reefs with increasing frequency
   and intensity since the late 1970s. Mass bleaching events, which often
   cover thousands of square kilometres of coral reefs, are triggered by
   small increases (+1-3degreesC) in water temperature. These increases in
   sea temperature are often seen during warm phase weather conditions
   (e.g. ENSO) and are increasing in size and magnitude. The loss of living
   coral cover (e.g. 16% globally in 1998, an exceptionally warm year) is
   resulting in an as yet unspecified reduction in the abundance of a
   myriad of other species. Projections from general circulation models
   (GCM) used to project changes in global temperature indicate that
   conditions even under the mildest greenhouse gas emission scenarios may
   exceed the thermal tolerances of most reef-building coral communities.
   Research must now explore key issues such as the extent to which the
   thermal tolerances of corals and their symbionts are dynamic if
   bleaching and disease are linked; how the loss of high densities of
   reef-building coral will affect other dependent species; and, how the
   loss of coral populations will affect the millions of people globally
   who depend on coral reefs for their daily survival.

AB Knowledge about the consequences of Arctic warming for marine
   biogeography remains limited. Mytilus mussels play a key ecological role
   in the littoral zone, and they are expected to be sensitive to climate
   change. Here we used a space-for-time approach as a first attempt to
   infer the coupling between climate warming and population structure and
   abundance of intertidal mussels along a latitudinal climate gradient in
   west Greenland. We analysed trends in air temperatures, collected
   seasonal temperature data from intertidal microhabitats, and quantified
   abundance, growth and age structure at 73 sites in 5 fjords. We also
   compared tolerance to sub-zero temperatures between seasons and
   latitudes. Since 1958, atmospheric temperatures have increased
   significantly in all fjords. Consequently, the number of days with
   temperatures below the lower lethal temperature, LT50 (-13 degrees C),
   has decreased by up to 57%, suggesting that constraint by low
   temperature is weakening. Abundance declined >95% with increasing
   latitude from an average of 23.67 to 0.71 ind. 0.0625 m(-2) in
   mid-intertidal habitats. However, no latitudinal differences in growth,
   average size (6.3-9 cm), age (1.5-2.5 yr) and mortality (55.9-62.5
   yr(-1)) were found. The abundance of 1 yr old recruits declined with
   latitude, indicating that geographical patterns are controlled at the
   earliest life stages. Air temperatures and exposure time were important
   drivers for latitudinal patterns in abundance, with adults being
   increasingly limited to favourable microhabitats in the lower intertidal
   to the North. Combined, the data suggest that increased warming will
   facilitate an increase in intertidal mussel abundance in Greenland, and
   potentially, across the Arctic.

AB Geographically widely spread species can cope with environmental
   differences among habitats by genetic differentiation and/or phenotypic
   flexibility. In marine crustaceans, intraspecific variations in
   life-history traits are pervasive along latitudinal clines. Replicated
   latitudinal clines are of evolutionary interest because they provide
   evidence of the occurrence of natural selection. If the means of traits
   along the latitudinal gradient are expected to be the result of natural
   selection, there is no reason why variances and covariances will not
   also be subject to selection, since selection is essentially a
   multivariate phenomenon. We studied life-history changes in means,
   variances, and covariances (i.e. P matrix) in 6 populations of the
   endemic crab Cyclograpsus cinereus (Decapoda: Grapsidae) along a
   latitudinal gradient over 19 degrees on the Chilean coast. Trait means
   differed among localities for all traits analyzed (i.e. female size,
   number and size of eggs, and reproductive output), and the variation
   displayed a clinal pattern. In general, the main result that emerged
   from planned comparisons of P matrices is that, when detected,
   differences between localities mainly reflect differences in the
   magnitude of phenotypic variation (i.e. eigenvalues), rather than in the
   relationships between traits (i.e. eigenvectors). Sea-surface
   temperature was only correlated with the covariance between egg numbers
   and reproductive output. Matrices comparisons for Flury and jackknife
   methods were highly linked, with limits of biogeographic provinces
   described for the coast of Chile. Our study strongly highlights the
   importance of estimating the P matrix, not only mean values, in order to
   understand the evolution of life-history traits along a latitudinal
   gradient. Furthermore, the study of the variation in the P matrix might
   provide important insights into those evolutionary forces acting on it.

AB As global warming accelerates, there is increasing concern about how
   ecosystems may change as a result of species loss and replacement. Here,
   we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus
   maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel
   thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we
   assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and
   acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly
   tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures
   than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both
   heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term
   acclimation (18-31 days at either 5 or 25 degrees C). Comparing patterns
   within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in
   the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North
   America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely
   evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the
   latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be
   due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences
   between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall,
   the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate
   invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and
   acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among
   populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these
   capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species,
   and may provide a model for success in a changing world.

AB The molecular biology of circadian rhythms has been extensively studied
   in mice, and the widespread expression of canonical circadian clock
   genes in peripheral organs is well established in this species. In
   contrast, much less information about the peripheral expression of
   haPer1, haPer2, and haBmal1 is available in Syrian hamsters despite the
   fact that this species is widely used for studies of circadian
   organization and photoperiodic responses. Furthermore, examination of
   oscillating expression of these genes in mouse testis has generated
   discrepant results, and little is known about gonadal expression of
   haPer1 and haBmal1 or their environmental control. To address these
   questions, the authors examined the pattern of haPer1 and haBmal1 in
   heart, kidney, liver, muscle, spleen, and testis of hamsters exposed to
   DD. In most organs, Northern blots suggested the existence of single
   transcripts of each of these messenger RNAs (mRNAs). haPer1 peaked in
   late subjective day and haBmal1 during the late subjective night. Closer
   inspection of SCN and muscle haPer1, however, revealed the existence of
   two major transcripts of similar size, as well as minor transcripts that
   varied in the 3'-untranslated region. In hamster testis, two haPer1
   transcripts were found, both of which are truncated relative to the
   corresponding mouse transcript and both of which contain a sequence
   homologous to intron 18 of mPer1. Neither testis transcript contains a
   nuclear localization signal, and haPer1 transcripts lacked the putative
   C-terminal CRY1-binding domain. Furthermore, the testis deviated from
   the general pattern in that haPer1 and haBmal1 both peaked in the
   subjective night. In situ hybridization revealed that haPer1, but not
   haBmal1, showed a heterogeneous distribution among seminiferous tubules.
   Hamster testis also expresses 2 haPer2 transcripts, but no circadian
   variation is evident. In a second experiment, long-term exposure to DD
   sufficient to induce gonadal regression was found to eliminate circadian
   oscillations of both testicular haPer1 transcripts. In contrast, gonadal
   regression was accompanied by a more robust rhythm of haBmal1.

   cyanobacterial biomass from March to August 2012 was well fitted to the
   logistic growth model. The growth rate of cyanobacteria was the highest
   in June, and the biomass of cyanobacteria reached a maximum in August.
   From February to March 2012, the main form of M. aeruginosa was the
   single-cell form; M. aeruginosa colonies began to appear from April, and
   blooms appeared on the water surface in May. The maximum diameter of the
   colonies was recorded in July, and then gradually decreased from August.
   The diameter range of M. aeruginosa colonies was 18.37-237.77 mu m, and
   most of the colonies were distributed in the range 20-200 mu m,
   comprising 95.5% of the total number of samples. Temperature and
   photosynthetically active radiation may be the most important factors
   that influenced the annual variation in M. aeruginosa biomass and forms.
   The suitable temperature for cyanobacterial growth was in the range of
   15-30A degrees C. In natural water bodies, photosynthetically active
   radiation had a significant positive influence on the colonial diameter
   of M. aeruginosa (P < 0.01).

AB Lower temperatures, extreme seasonality and shorter growing seasons at
   higher latitudes are expected to cause a decline in metabolic rates and
   annual growth rates of ectotherms. If a reduction in the rates of these
   biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may
   evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by
   high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal
   compensation in ectotherms, we used a common-garden experiment to
   investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured
   as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy
   allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three
   populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a
   latitudinal gradient of 1300 km in Chile. Our results did not support
   the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates
   (metabolic cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient
   variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal
   population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from
   lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a
   lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a
   differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue,
   revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest
   latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy
   allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act
   as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails
   from the highest latitudinal population.

AB This paper documents the main features of the climate and climate
   variability over South America, on the basis of instrumental
   observations gathered during the 20th Century. It should provide a modem
   reference framework for paleoclimate research in South America,
   targeting high-resolution proxies over the past few centuries. Several
   datasets suitable for present-day climate research are first described,
   highlighting their advantages as well as their limitations. We then
   provide a basic physical understanding of the mean annual cycle of the
   precipitation and atmospheric circulation over the continent and the
   adjacent oceans. In particular, the diversity of precipitation,
   temperature and wind patterns is interpreted in terms of the long
   meridional extent of the continent and the disruption of the large-scale
   circulation caused by the Andes cordillera, the contrasting oceanic
   boundary conditions and the landmass distribution. Similarly, the
   intensity and timing of the interannual and interdecadal climatic
   fluctuations exhibit considerable geographical dependence, as some
   regions are more influenced by large-scale phenomena rooted in the
   tropical oceans while others are more influenced by high-latitude
   phenomena. The impact of these large-scale phenomena over South America
   is documented by a regression analysis between selected atmospheric
   indices and the precipitation and temperature fields. We have included a
   discussion on the seasonality and long-term stability of such impacts,
   and complemented our general description by an updated review of the
   literature on climate variability over specific regions. (C) 2008

AB Knowledge of Antarctic biotas and environments has increased
   dramatically in recent years. there has also been a rapid increase in
   the use of novel technologies. Despite this, some fundamental aspects of
   environmental control that structure physiological, ecological and
   fife-history traits in Antarctic organisms have received little
   attention. Possibly the most important of these is the timing and
   availability of resources, and the way In which this dictates the tempo
   or pace of life. The clearest view of this effect conics From
   comparisons of species living in different habitats. Here, We (i) show
   that the timing and extent of resource availability, from nutrients to
   colonisable space, differ across Antarctic marine, intertidal and
   terrestrial habitats, and (ii) illustrate that these differences affect
   the rate at which organisms function. Consequently, there are many
   dramatic biological differences between organisms that live as little as
   10 m apart, but have gaping voids between them ecologically.
   Identifying the effects of environmental timing and predictability
   requires detailed analysis in a wide context, where Antarctic
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems are at one extreme of the continuum of
   available environments For many characteristics including temperature,
   ice cover and seasonality. Anthropocentrically, Antarctica is harsh and
   as might be expected terrestrial animal and plant diversity and biomass
   are restricted. By contrast, Antarctic marine biotas are rich and
   diverse and several phyla are represented at levels greater than global
   averages. There has been much debate on the relative importance of
   various physical Factors that structure the characteristics of Antarctic
   biotas. This is especially so for temperature and seasonality, and their
   effects on physiology, life history and biodiversity. More recently,
   habitat age and persistence through previous ice maxima have been
   identified as key factors dictating biodiversity and endemism. Modern
   molecular methods have also recently been incorporated into many
   traditional areas of polar biology. Environmental predictability
   dictates many of the biological characters seen in all or these areas of
   Antarctic research.

AB Understanding and monitoring life history traits is often important in
   endangered species conservation. Populations of the endangered mussel
   Cumberlandian combshell Epioblasma brevidens have continued to decline
   in the Powell River, USA. Understanding and modeling mussel growth is
   critical for effective reintroduction of this endangered species. In
   this study, 2 yr old E. brevidens that were produced in our laboratory
   were released to the Powell River in 2009 to augment this declining
   population. A mark-recapture monitoring approach using passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) tags was used to assess the survival and
   growth of the released mussels. Hierarchical Bayesian growth models
   incorporating individual growth variations, periodic growth and growth
   cessations, along with multiple release occasions were developed and
   compared to the classic von Bertalanffy growth model. Our results showed
   that the hierarchical model that incorporated individual growth
   variation gave the best estimates of model parameters, yielding the
   lowest deviance information criterion value. Mussels exhibited different
   growth rates (K), including 0.015, 0.026, 0.110 and 0.050 (mo(-1)),
   corresponding to the duration of laboratory culture (ages 2, 3 and 4 yr
   old) and a growth cessation (GC) for 5.98 mo, respectively. The other
   parameters of asymptotic length (L-infinity) and age at zero length
   (t(0)) were 51.36 mm and -0.648 mo. The flexible structure of Bayesian
   hierarchical models allowed us to examine growth characteristics of E.
   brevidens in a changing environment to better understand the details of
   its growth and lifespan, thus providing useful data for conservation
   management.

AB The permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska is densely populated by
   shallow lakes that result from thermokarst erosion. These lakes release
   methane (CH4) derived from a combination of ancient thermogenic pools
   and contemporary biogenic production. Despite the potential importance
   of CH4 as a greenhouse gas, the contribution of biogenic CH4 production
   in arctic thermokarst lakes in Alaska is not currently well understood.
   To further advance our knowledge of CH4 dynamics in these lakes, we
   focused our study on (i) the potential for microbial CH4 production in
   lake sediments, (ii) the role of sediment geochemistry in controlling
   biogenic CH4 production, and (iii) the temperature dependence of this
   process. Sediment cores were collected from one site in Siqlukaq Lake
   and two sites in Sukok Lake in late October to early November. Analyses
   of pore water geochemistry, sedimentary organic matter and lipid
   biomarkers, stable carbon isotopes, results from CH4 production
   experiments, and copy number of a methanogenic pathway-specific gene
   (mcrA) indicated the existence of different sources of CH4 in each of
   the lakes chosen for the study. Analysis of this integrated data set
   revealed that there is biological CH4 production in Siqlukaq at moderate
   levels, while the very low levels of CH4 detected in Sukok had a mixed
   origin, with little to no biological CH4 production. Furthermore,
   methanogenic archaea exhibited temperature-dependent use of in situ
   substrates for methanogenesis, and the amount of CH4 produced was
   directly related to the amount of labile organic matter in the
   sediments. This study constitutes an important first step in better
   understanding the actual contribution of biogenic CH4 from thermokarst
   lakes on the coastal plain of Alaska to the current CH4 budgets.

   introduction of the virus. The model included 2 host species (horses and
   donkeys) and 1 vector species (Culicoides imicola Kieffer). Latin
   hypercube sampling was used for sensitivity analysis of the model, to
   include uncertainty in parameter estimates. In general, if an epidemic
   occurred most hosts were infected. The peak prevalence in midges was
   low, and never exceeded 3%. Midge population size, the recovery rate in
   horses, and tile time of year when the virus was introduced were the
   most significant factors in determining whether or not an epidemic
   occurred. The uncertainty in interbloodmeal interval, removal rate
   (mortality and recovery) of infectious horses, midge population size,
   and transmission rates were significant factors in the size of the
   epidemic. These factors should be priorities for empirical research, and
   should be considered in the design of control strategies in areas at
   risk of virus introduction.

AB Understanding general rules governing macroecological body size
   variations is one of the oldest pursuits in ecology. However, this
   science has been dominated by studies of terrestrial vertebrates,
   spurring debate over the validity of such rules in other taxonomic
   groups. Here, relationships between maximum body size and latitude,
   temperature, and elevation were evaluated for 29 North American
   freshwater fish species. Bergmann''s rule (i.e., that body size
   correlates positively with latitude and negatively with temperature) was
   observed in 38% of species, converse Bergmann''s rule (that body size
   correlates negatively with latitude and positively with temperature) was
   observed in 34% of species, and 28% of species showed no macroecological
   body size relationships. Most notably, every species that expressed
   Bergmann''s rule was a cool- or cold-water species while every species
   that expressed converse Bergmann''s rule was a warm-water species,
   highlighting how these patterns are likely connected to species thermal
   niches. This study contradicts previous research suggesting Bergmann''s
   rule does not apply to freshwater fishes, and is congruent with an
   emerging paradigm of variable macroecological body size patterns in
   poikilotherms.

AB Objective Although many studies have examined the effects of ambient
   temperatures on mortality, little evidence is on health impacts of
   atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. This study aimed to assess
   the impacts of atmospheric pressure and relative humidity on mortality
   in Guangzhou, China.
   Methods This study included 213,737 registered deaths during 2003-2011
   in Guangzhou, China. A quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag
   non-linear model was used to assess the effects of atmospheric
   pressure/relative humidity.
   Results We found significant effect of low atmospheric pressure/relative
   humidity on mortality. There was a 1.79% (95% confidence interval:
   0.38%-3.22%) increase in non-accidental mortality and a 2.27%
   (0.07%-4.51%) increase in cardiovascular mortality comparing the 5th and
   25th percentile of atmospheric pressure. A 3.97% (0.67%-7.39%) increase
   in cardiovascular mortality was also observed comparing the 5th and 25th
   percentile of relative humidity. Women were more vulnerable to decrease
   in atmospheric pressure and relative humidity than men. Age and
   education attainment were also potential effect modifiers. Furthermore,
   low atmospheric pressure and relative humidity increased
   temperature-related mortality.
   Conclusion Both low atmospheric pressure and relative humidity are
   important risk factors of mortality. Our findings would be helpful to
   develop health risk assessment and climate policy interventions that
   would better protect vulnerable subgroups of the population.

AB The mathematical models used in predictive microbiology contain
   parameters that must be estimated based on experimental data. Due to
   experimental uncertainty and variability, they cannot be known exactly
   and must be reported with a measure of uncertainty (usually a standard
   deviation). In order to increase precision (i.e. reduce the standard
   deviation), it is usual to add extra sampling points. However, recent
   studies have shown that precision can also be increased without adding
   extra sampling points by using Optimal Experiment Design, which applies
   optimization and information theory to identify the most informative
   experiment under a set of constraints. Nevertheless, to date, there has
   been scarce contributions to know a priori whether an experimental
   design is likely to provide the desired precision in the parameter
   estimates. In this article, two complementary methodologies to predict
   the parameter precision for a given experimental design are proposed.
   Both approaches are based on in silico simulations, so they can be
   performed before any experimental work. The first one applies Monte
   Carlo simulations to estimate the standard deviation of the model
   parameters, whereas the second one applies the properties of the Fisher
   Information Matrix to estimate the volume of the confidence ellipsoids.
   The application of these methods to a case study of dynamic microbial
   inactivation, showing how they can be used to compare experimental
   designs and assess their precision, is illustrated. The results show
   that, as expected, the optimal experimental design is more accurate than
   the uniform design with the same number of data points. Furthermore, it
   is demonstrated that, for some heating profiles, the uniform design does
   not ensure that a higher number of sampling points increases precision.
   Therefore, optimal experimental designs are highly recommended in
   predictive microbiology.

AB Temporal coherence (ie the degree of synchronicity of a given variable
   among ecological units within a predefined space) has been shown for
   several limnological features among temperate lakes, allowing
   predictions about the structure and function of ecosystems However,
   there is little evidence of temporal coherence among tropical aquatic
   systems, where the climatic variability among seasons is less pronounced
   Here, we used data from long-term monitoring of physical chemical and
   biological variables to test the degree of temporal coherence among 18
   tropical coastal lagoons The water temperature and chlorophyll-a
   concentration had the highest and lowest temporal coherence among the
   lagoons respectively whereas the salinity and water colour had
   intermediate temporal coherence The regional climactic factors were the
   main factors responsible for the coherence patterns in the water
   temperature and water colour, whereas the landscape position and
   morphometric characteristics explained much of the variation of the
   salinity and water colour among the lagoons These results indicate that
   both local (lagoon morphometry) and regional (precipitation) air
   temperature) factors regulate the physical and chemical conditions of
   coastal lagoons by adjusting the terrestrial and marine subsidies at a
   landscape-scale On the other hand the chlorophyll a concentration
   appears to be primarily regulated by specific local conditions resulting
   in a weak temporal coherence among the ecosystems We concluded that
   temporal coherence in tropical ecosystems is possible, at least for some
   environmental features and should be evaluated for other tropical
   ecosystems Our results also reinforce that aquatic ecosystems should be
   studied more broadly to accomplish a full understanding of their

AB Most organisms are exposed to bouts of warm temperatures during
   development, yet we know little about how variation in the timing and
   continuity of heat exposure influences biological processes. If heat
   waves increase in frequency and duration as predicted, it is necessary
   to understand how these bouts could affect thermally sensitive species,
   including reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD).
   In a multi-year study using fluctuating temperatures, we
   exposedTrachemys scriptaembryos to cooler, male-producing temperatures
   interspersed with warmer, female-producing temperatures (heat waves)
   that varied in either timing during development or continuity and then
   analysed resulting sex ratios. We also quantified the expression of
   genes involved in testis differentiation (Dmrt1) and ovary
   differentiation (Cyp19A1) to determine how heat wave continuity affects
   the expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation. Heat waves
   applied during the middle of development produced significantly more
   females compared to heat waves that occurred just 7 days before or after
   this window, and even short gaps in the continuity of a heat wave
   decreased the production of females. Continuous heat exposure resulted
   in increasedCyp19A1expression while discontinuous heat exposure failed
   to increase expression in either gene over a similar time course. We
   report that even small differences in the timing and continuity of heat
   waves can result in drastically different phenotypic outcomes. This
   strong effect of temperature occurred despite the fact that embryos were
   exposed to the same number of warm days during a short period of time,
   which highlights the need to study temperature effects under more
   ecologically relevant conditions where temperatures may be elevated for
   only a few days at a time. In the face of a changing climate, the
   finding that subtle shifts in temperature exposure result in substantial
   effects on embryonic development becomes even more critical.

AB Aims: The incidence of toxigenicity among Australian isolates of
   Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus carbonarius was assessed. Aspergillus
   rot and concomitant production of ochratoxin A (OA) in bunches
   inoculated with A. carbonarius were also investigated.
   Methods and Results: Aspergillus niger and A. carbonarius were isolated
   from vineyard soils. Aspergillus niger was more widespread than A.
   carbonarius, and two restriction fragment length polymorphism types of
   A. niger, N and T, were present. Three of 113 A. niger isolates and all
   33 A. carbonarius isolates produced OA. Aspergillus carbonarius was
   inoculated onto Semillon bunches with and without damage in the month
   before harvest. Damaged berries at greater than 12 3 degrees Bx were
   particularly susceptible to Aspergillus rot and production of OA, which
   was concentrated in severely mouldy berries.
   Conclusions: OA in Australian grapes results mainly from infection of
   berries by A. carbonarius. It is concentrated in discoloured, shrivelled
   berries. The potential for Aspergillus rot and OA production appears to
   commence after veraison and increase with berry damage and ripeness.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Minimizing damage to grapes
   between veraison and harvest significantly reduces Aspergillus rot and
   OA formation. Monitoring the extent of Aspergillus rot in bunches
   infected with toxigenic Aspergillus spp. may give some indication of OA
   contamination.

AB Since the late 1980s, elevated levels of mercury have been reported in
   the tissues of the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) from the
   Florida Everglades. The extent, degree, and length of time of mercury
   contamination in the Florida panther are unknown. The objective of this
   study was to determine the historical and other patterns of monomethyl
   and inorganic mercury in the Florida panther by analysis of mercury in
   panther hair from museum collections. In addition, this study evaluated
   the effects of preservation of skins on mercury concentrations in hair
   and the representativeness of museum collections for evaluating
   historical trends of contamination in the Florida panther. Hair from 42
   Florida panther specimens collected from 1896 to 1995 was analyzed for
   both monomethyl and inorganic mercury. Monomethyl mercury (MMHg) and
   inorganic mercury (IHg) were found in all specimens. Monomethyl mercury
   in hair from untanned skins was significantly higher than MMHg in hair
   from tanned skins. For untanned specimens, the mean MMHg concentration
   in hair was 1.62 +/- 1.87 mug/g (range 0.11 to 6.68 mug/g, n = 16).
   Monomethyl mercury accounted for 88% of the total mercury in untanned
   Florida panther hair. No sexual or geographical differences were found.
   Although MMHg is generally stable in hair, the tanning process appears
   to reduce the amount of MMHg in hair. In addition, exogenous IHg
   contamination of the panther hair was found in museum specimens,
   especially in older specimens. The implication of these and other
   factors in interpreting results of museum studies is discussed. The
   presence of MMHg in panther hair since the 1890s indicates long-term and
   widespread exposure of the Florida panther to mercury. Levels of MMHg
   are significantly greater in the 1990s than the 1890s. When combined
   with field studies of mercury in the Florida panther, considerable
   individual variability is observed, reflecting short-term changes in
   exposure of individual panthers to mercury. Although museum specimens
   showed a significant increase in MMHg over the last 100 years, they did
   not show the magnitude of increase that field populations of Florida
   panthers did. A number of Florida panthers appeared to be at risk from
   mercury over their lifetimes, especially individuals from the early
   1990s.

AB Accurate assessment of local recombination rate variation is crucial for
   understanding the recombina tion process and for determining the impact
   of natural selection on linked sites. In Drosophila, local recombination
   intensity has been estimated primarily by statistical approaches, by
   estimating the local slope of the relationship between the physical and
   genetic maps. However, these estimates are limited in resolution and, as
   a result, the physical scale at which recombination intensity varies in
   Drosophila is largely unknown. Although there is some evidence
   suggesting as much as a 40-fold variation in crossover rate at a local
   scale in D. pseudoobscura, little is known about the fine-scale
   structure of recombination rate variation in D. melanogaster. Here we
   experimentally examine the fine-scale distribution of crossover events
   in a 1.2-Mb region on the D. melanogaster X chromosome using a classic
   genetic mapping approach. Our results show that crossover frequency is
   significantly heterogeneous within this region, varying approximately
   3.5-fold. Simulations suggest that this degree of heterogeneity is
   sufficient to affect levels of standing nucleotide diversity, although
   the magnitude of this effect is small. We recover no statistical
   association between empirical estimates of nucleotide diversity and
   recombination intensity, which is likely due to the limited number of
   loci sampled in our population genetic data set. However, codon bias is
   significantly negatively correlated with fine-scale recombination
   intensity estimates, as expected. Our results shed light on the relevant
   physical scale to consider in evolutionary analyses relating to
   recombination rate and highlight the motivations to increase the
   resolution of the recombination map in Drosophila.

AB Dinophysis acuta is a frequent seasonal lipophilic toxin producer in
   European Atlantic coastal waters associated with thermal stratification.
   In the Galician Rias, populations of D. acuta with their epicentre
   located off Aveiro (northern Portugal), typically co-occur with and
   follow those of Dinophysis acuminata during the upwelling transition
   (early autumn) as a result of longshore transport. During hotter than
   average summers, D. acuta blooms also occur in August in the Rias, when
   they replace D. acuminata. Here we examined a 30-year (1985-2014) time
   series of D. acuta from samples collected by the same method in the
   Galician Rias. Our main objective was to identify patterns of
   distribution and their relation with climate variability, and to explain
   the exceptional summer blooms of D. acuta in 1989-1990. A dome shaped
   relationship was found between summer upwelling intensity and D. acuta
   blooms; cell maxima were associated with conditions where the balance
   between upwelling intensity and heating, leading to deepened
   thermoclines, combined with tidal phase (3 days after neap tides)
   created windows of opportunity for this species. The application of a
   generalized additive model based on biological (D. acuta inoculum) and
   environmental predictors (Cumulative June-August upwelling CUIJJA,
   average June August SSTJJA and tidal range) explained more than 70% of
   the deviance for the exceptional summer blooms of D. acuta, through a
   combination of moderate (35,000-50,000 m(3) s(-1) km(-1)) summer
   upwelling (CUIJJA), thermal stratification (SSTJJA > 17 degrees C) and
   moderate tidal range (similar to 2.5 m), provided D. acuta cells
   (inoculum) were present in July. There was no evidence of increasing
   trends in D. acuta bloom frequency/intensity nor a clear relationship
   with NAO or other long-term climatic cycles. Instead, the exceptional
   summer blooms of 1989-1990 appeared linked to extreme hydroclimatic
   anomalies (high positive anomalies in SST and NAO index), which affected
   most of the European Atlantic coast. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

AB The mosquito species is one of most important insect vectors of several
   diseases, namely, malaria, filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue,
   and so on. In particular, in recent years, as the number of people who
   enjoy outdoor activities in urban areas continues to increase,
   information about mosquito activity is in demand. Furthermore, mosquito
   activity prediction is crucial for managing the safety and the health of
   humans. However, the estimation of mosquito abundances frequently
   involves uncertainty because of high spatial and temporal variations,
   which hinders the accuracy of general mechanistic models of mosquito
   abundances. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a simpler and
   lighter mosquito abundance prediction model. In this study, we tested
   the efficacy of the artificial neural network (ANN), which is a popular
   empirical model, for mosquito abundance prediction. For comparison, we
   also developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Both the ANN
   and the MLR models were applied to estimate mosquito abundances in
   2-year observations in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, conducted using the
   Digital Mosquito Monitoring System (DMS). As input variables, we used
   meteorological data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and
   precipitation. The results showed that performances of the ANN model and
   the MLR model are almost same in terms of R and root mean square error
   (RMSE). The ANN model was able to predict the high variability as
   compared to MLR. A sensitivity analysis of the ANN model showed that the
   relationships between input variables and mosquito abundances were well
   explained. In conclusion, ANNs have the potential to predict
   fluctuations in mosquito numbers (especially the extreme values), and
   can do so better than traditional statistical techniques. But, much more
   work needs to be conducted to assess meaningful time delays in
   environmental variables and mosquito numbers. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Morphological and physiological plasticity is often thought to represent
   an adaptive response to variable environments. However, determining
   whether a given pattern of plasticity is in fact adaptive is
   analytically challenging, as is evaluating the degree of and limits to
   adaptive plasticity. Here we describe a general methodological framework
   for studying the evolution of plastic responses. This framework
   synthesizes recent analytical advances from both evolutionary ecology
   and functional biology, and it does so by integrating field experiments,
   functional and physiological analyses, environmental data, and genetic
   studies of plasticity. We argue that studies of plasticity in response
   to the thermal environment may be particularly valuable in understanding
   the role of environmental variation in the evolution of plasticity: not
   only can thermally-relevant traits often be mechanistically and
   physiologically linked to the thermal environment, but also the
   variability and predictability of the thermal environment itself can be
   quantified on ecologically relevant time scales. We illustrate this
   approach by reviewing a case study of seasonal plasticity in the extent
   of wing melanization in Western White Butterflies (Pontia occidentalis).
   This review demonstrates that 1) wing melanin plasticity is heritable,
   2) plasticity does increase fitness in nature, but the effect varies
   between seasons and between Sears, 3) selection on existing variation in
   the magnitude of plasticity favors increased plasticity in one melanin
   trait that affects thermoregulation, but 4) the marked unpredictability
   of short-term (within-season) weather patterns substantially limits the
   capacity of plasticity to match optimal wing phenotypes to the weather
   conditions actually experienced. We complement the above case study with
   a casual review of selected aspects of thermal acclimation responses.
   The magnitude of thermal acclimation ("flexibility") is demonstrably
   modest rather than fully compensatory. The magnitude of genetic
   variation (crucial to evolutionary responses to selection) in thermal
   acclimation responses has been investigated in only a few species to
   date. In conclusion, we suggest that an understanding of selection and
   evolution of thermal acclimation will be enhanced by experimental
   examinations of mechanistic links between traits and environments, of
   the physiological bases and functional consequences of acclimation, of
   patterns of environmental variability and predictability, of the fitness
   consequences of acclimation in nature, and of potential genetic
   constraints.

AB Fish behavioural effects under Ocean Acidification (OA) rely on changes
   expected to occur in brain function, which can be reversed by gabazine,
   a GABA-A antagonist. Here, using standard two-channel choice flume, we
   assessed OA effects on the predator recognition ability of both
   gabazine-treated and-untreated Symphodus ocellatus post-settlers living
   off CO2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea. To estimate the post-settlers
   background predation risk we evaluated the density of their predator in
   the wild and through otolith aging techniques we assessed their
   post-settlement growth. Results showed that: 1) post-settlers predator
   recognition was unaffected under OA; 2) post-settlers living in elevated
   CO2 were on average 15% bigger in size than those from ambient
   conditions. Our results support fish behavioural tolerance to OA,
   potentially mediated by pre-exposure to high risk predation levels, and
   speculate that by increasing body size, juvenile fish might more
   efficiently avoid their predators.

AB Climate change and intense land use practices are the main threats to
   ecosystem structure and services of Mediterranean lakes. Therefore, it
   is essential to predict the future changes and develop mitigation
   measures to combat such pressures. In this study, Lake Beysehir, the
   largest freshwater lake in the Mediterranean basin, was selected to
   study the impacts of climate change and various land use scenarios on
   the ecosystem dynamics of Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems and the
   services that they provide. For this purpose, we linked catchment model
   outputs to the two different processed-based lake models: PCLake and
   GLM-AED, and tested the scenarios of five General Circulation Models,
   two Representation Concentration Pathways and three different land use
   scenarios, which enable us to consider the various sources of
   uncertainty. Climate change and land use scenarios generally predicted
   strong future decreases in hydraulic and nutrient loads from the
   catchment to the lake. These changes in loads translated into
   alterations in water level as well as minor changes in chlorophyll a
   (Chl-a) concentrations. We also observed an increased abundance of
   cyanobacteria in both lake models. Total phosphorus, temperature and
   hydraulic loading were found to be the most important variables
   determining cyanobacteria biomass. As the future scenarios revealed only
   minor changes in Chl-a due to the significant decrease in nutrient
   loads, our results highlight that reduced nutrient loading in a warming
   world may play a crucial role in offsetting the effects of temperature
   on phytoplankton growth. However, our results also showed increased
   abundance of cyanobacteria in the future may threaten ecosystem
   integrity and may limit drinking water ecosystem services. In addition,
   extended periods of decreased hydraulic loads from the catchment and
   increased evaporation may lead to water level reductions and may
   diminish the ecosystem services of the lake as a water supply for
   irrigation and drinking water. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB North American Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations experienced
   substantial declines in the early 1990s, and many populations have
   persisted at low abundances in recent years. Abundance and productivity
   declined in a coherent manner across major regions of North America, and
   this coherence points toward a potential shift in marine survivorship,
   rather than local, river-specific factors. The major declines in
   Atlantic salmon populations occurred against a backdrop of physical and
   biological shifts in Northwest Atlantic ecosystems. Analyses of changes
   in climate, physical, and lower trophic level biological factors provide
   substantial evidence that climate conditions directly and indirectly
   influence the abundance and productivity of North American Atlantic
   salmon populations. A major decline in salmon abundance after 1990 was
   preceded by a series of changes across multiple levels of the ecosystem,
   and a subsequent population change in 1997, primarily related to salmon
   productivity, followed an unusually low NAO event. Pairwise correlations
   further demonstrate that climate and physical conditions are associated
   with changes in plankton communities and prey availability, which are
   ultimately linked to Atlantic salmon populations. Results suggest that
   poor trophic conditions, likely due to climate-driven environmental
   factors, and warmer ocean temperatures throughout their marine habitat
   area are constraining the productivity and recovery of North American
   Atlantic salmon populations.

AB A variety of inimical factors, i.e. sea surface temperature, nutrient
   input, nature of substrates, were invoked previously to explain the
   retardation in reef settlement in New Caledonia during the Holocene. In
   order to clarify the respective role played by temperature and nutrient
   level in the growth of fringing reefs along the southwest coast of the
   island, trace element ratios, i.e. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca, were used,
   respectively, as a paleothermometer and as a tracer of nutrient load
   from modem and mid-Holocene (about 6000 calendar years old) massive
   Porites coral colonies. The results obtained from the modem coral record
   indicate that, near the outer barrier reef, upwelling activity is
   controlled by southeast winds blowing in summer. By contrast, along the
   southwest coastline, the fringing reefs are subjected to barium input
   mainly derived from weathering of barite-rich rocks cropping out in the
   adjacent mainland.
   Comparison between the fossil and modem coral Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca records
   shed light on three different aspects of the mid-Holocene climate and
   coral reef evolution in New Caledonia: (1) the variability of paleo-sea
   surface temperature (SST) seems to have been similar to the modem one,
   although the island probably experienced SST about 1 degrees C higher
   than at present; (2) upwelling activity appears to have been greater
   than at present. Barium being supplied from the open sea to coastal
   zones by strong-wind generated upwelling currents, in relation to
   cooling events; (3) the onset of reef development in the southwest areas
   of New Caledonia was delayed due to the stronger upwelling of
   nutrient-enriched waters during the early-middle Holocene. The flowing
   of upwelled waters over the southwest coastal areas began at 8200
   calendar years BP, and ceased at the time when the outer barrier reef
   crest reached present-day sea level, about 5500 to 5000 calendar years
   ago. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   2016 to determine thrips species composition and abundance in Alabama
   soybean agroecosystems. Thrips were monitored weekly by collecting them
   on yellow sticky traps and soybean plant parts including foliage and
   reproductive structures. All three reported vectors of SVNV were
   identified in Alabama, with N. variabilis and F. tritici as the
   predominant species, while F. fusca was not consistently collected from
   soybean plants. Four additional thrips species were collected, of which
   Echinothrips americanus (Morgan) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) was commonly
   found on soybean at all three locations. Results presented in this study
   provide new information about seasonal thrips species abundance in
   soybean agroecosystems in Alabama, and is an important first step to
   understanding thrips vector species of epidemiological importance in the
   Southern United States.

AB Invasive species cope with novel environments through both phenotypic
   plasticity and evolutionary change. However, the environmental factors
   that cause evolutionary divergence in invasive species are poorly
   understood. We developed predictions for how different life-history
   traits, and plasticity in those traits, may respond to environmental
   gradients in seasonal temperatures, season length and natural enemies.
   We then tested these predictions in four geographic populations of the
   invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America. We
   examined the influence of two rearing temperatures (20 and 26.7 degrees
   C) on pupal mass, pupal development time, immune function and fecundity.
   As predicted, development time was shorter and immune function was
   greater in populations adapted to longer season length. Also, phenotypic
   plasticity in development time was greater in regions with shorter
   growing seasons. Populations differed significantly in mean and
   plasticity of body mass and fecundity, but these differences were not
   associated with seasonal temperatures or season length. Our study shows
   that some life-history traits, such as development time and immune
   function, can evolve rapidly in response to latitudinal variation in
   season length and natural enemies, whereas others traits did not. Our
   results also indicate that phenotypic plasticity in development time can
   also diverge rapidly in response to environmental conditions for some
   traits.

AB Root activities in terms of respiration and non-structural carbohydrates
   (NSC) storage and mobilization have been suggested as major
   physiological roles in fine root lifespan. As more frequent heat waves
   and drought periods within the next decades are expected, to what extent
   does thermal acclimation in fine roots represent a mechanism to cope
   with such upcoming climatic conditions? In this study, the possible
   changes in very fine (diameter<0.5mm) and fine (0.5-1mm) root morphology
   and physiology in terms of respiration rate and NSC [soluble sugars (SS)
   and starch] concentrations, were investigated on 2-year-old Fagus
   sylvatica saplings subjected to a simulated long-lasting heat wave event
   and to co-occurring soil drying. For both very fine and fine roots, soil
   temperature (ST) resulted inversely correlated with specific root
   length, respiration rates and SSs concentration, but directly correlated
   with root mass, root tissue density and starch concentration. In
   particular, starch concentration increased under 28 degrees C for
   successively decreasing under 21 degrees C ST. These findings showed
   that thermal acclimation in very fine and fine roots due to 24days
   exposure to high ST (approximate to 28 degrees C), induced starch
   accumulation. Such carbon-savings strategy' should bear the maintenance
   costs associated to the recovery process in case of restored favorable
   environmental conditions, such as those occurring at the end of a heat
   wave event. Drought condition seems to affect the fine root vitality
   much more under moderate than high temperature condition, making the
   temporary exposure to high ST less threatening to root vitality than
   expected.

AB In evolutionary physiology, studies of inter-individual variation (i.e.
   repeatability) in functional capacities are valuable as they indicate -
   within populations - what attributes could respond to natural selection.
   Although repeatability and quantitative genetics of physiological traits
   in energy metabolism of eutherian mammals have been well characterized,
   few or no studies have been performed on marsupials. We studied the
   repeatability (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient, tau) of
   bioenergetics for Monito del Monte (Dromiciops gliroides), the sole
   living representative of an otherwise extinct marsupial order
   (Microbiotheria). We measured resting metabolic rate as CO2 production
   ((V)over dot(CO2) and O-2 consumption ((V)over dot(O2)) simultaneously,
   together with minimum thermal conductance (C), evaporative water loss
   (EWL) and respiratory quotient (RQ), in a sample of ca. 20 individuals.
   Our results suggest that D. gliroides exhibits poor control of body
   temperature (T-b), with a thermal amplitude of ca. 10 C in normothermia.
   As a consequence, repeatability of Tb and metabolic rate (either as
   (V)over dot(CO2) or (V)over dot(O2)) were relatively low (tau(Tb) = 0.25
   +/- 0.04, tau(V)over dot(CO2) = 0.14 +/- 0.03, tau(V)over dot(O2) = 0.24
   +/- 0.02, jackknife estimations of standard errors). Thermal conductance
   exhibited near-zero or negative repeatability and was lower than
   expected for marsupials. However, we found significant repeatability for
   RQ and EWL (tau = 0.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.49 +/- 0.09, respectively). In
   general, these results suggest that Monito del Monte exhibits some.
   'reptilian' physiological characteristics. The relatively low
   repeatability of physiological variables, which otherwise exhibit large
   inter-individual and genetic variance in eutherian mammals, suggests
   that these capacities do not exhibit evolutionary potential in the
   ancient order Microbiotheria.

AB The cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii provides an excellent model for the
   study of reaction norms across discrete environments because it breeds
   on rotting tissues (rots) of very different cactus species. Here we test
   the possible effects of second chromosome inversions on body size and
   shape (wing loading) across suitable natural breeding substrates. Using
   homokaryotypic stocks derived from several lines homozygous for four
   naturally occurring chromosomal inversions, we show that arrangements
   significantly affect size-related traits and wing loading. In addition,
   karyotypes show differing effects, across natural breeding resources,
   for wing loading. The 2st and 2jz(3) arrangements decrease and the 2j
   arrangement increases wing loading. For thorax length and wing loading,
   karyotypic correlations across host plants are slightly lower in females
   than in males. These results support the hypothesis that these traits
   have a genetic basis associated with the inversion polymorphism.

AB Freezing injury is a major factor limiting the geographical distribution
   of plant species and the growth and yield of crop plants. Plants from
   temperate climates are able to increase their freezing tolerance during
   exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures in a process termed cold
   acclimation. Damage to cellular membranes is the major cause of freezing
   injury in plants, and membrane lipid composition is strongly modified
   during cold acclimation. Forward and reverse genetic approaches have
   been used to probe the role of specific lipid-modifying enzymes in the
   freezing tolerance of plants. In the present paper we describe an
   alternative ecological genomics approach that relies on the natural
   genetic variation within a species. Arabidopsis thaliana has a wide
   geographical range throughout the Northern Hemisphere with significant
   natural variation in freezing tolerance that was used for a comparative
   analysis of the lipidomes of 15 Arabidopsis accessions using
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Fourier-transformmass
   spectrometry, allowing the detection of 180 lipid species. After 14 days
   of cold acclimation at 4 degrees C the plants from most accessions had
   accumulated massive amounts of storage lipids, with most of the changes
   in long-chain unsaturated triacylglycerides, while the total amount of
   membrane lipids was only slightly changed. Nevertheless, major changes
   in the relative amounts of different membrane lipids were also evident.
   The relative abundance of several lipid species was highly correlated
   with the freezing tolerance of the accessions, allowing the
   identification of possible marker lipids for plant freezing tolerance.

AB Local genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two mechanisms
   that can have marked effects on the morphology, performance, and
   behaviour of animals, producing geographic variation among populations.
   However, few studies have examined how these mechanisms interact during
   ontogeny to shape organismal phenotypes. We incubated eggs of the
   western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, from four populations
   (representing two latitudes and altitudes) in either a warm or cool
   environment in the laboratory. We then raised the hatchlings under
   common laboratory conditions, measured morphological and performance
   traits until 5 weeks of age, and compared juvenile morphology with that
   of field-caught adults from each population. The results obtained
   indicate that some phenotypic traits that contribute to performance
   (body size, hindlimb length, head shape) were relatively canalized in
   juveniles and differed among populations in a way that was consistent
   with adults from their population of origin. However, other traits
   (forelimb length, inter-limb length, mass, tail length), showed
   significant effects of incubation temperature, and this environmentally
   induced variation persisted throughout the experiment. Although
   selection pressure may be stronger for traits that are integral to
   survival, developmental effects might still have a lasting impact on
   traits less important to organismal fitness. We discuss the results
   obtained in the present study the context of the life history of these
   animals. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of

AB Underpinning the success of coral reefs in nutrient poor marine
   environments is mutualism established between corals and members of the
   phylum Symbiodiniaceae. In recent decades, reef-building corals have
   been affected by multiple stressors including bleaching, which results
   largely from elevated sea surface temperature and exposure to excessive
   solar radiation, ultimately caused by global warming. Accumulating
   evidence demonstrates differential resistance to bleaching among
   coral-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships; encouraging studies on the diversity
   and phylogenetics of Symbiodiniaceae. Examination of the existing
   knowledge reveals insights into both longitudinal and latitudinal
   partitioning of members of Symbiodiniaceae at genus level, throughout
   the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Contrary to expectations, due to
   decreasing sea surface temperature with latitude, this review has
   revealed an increase of polymorphic symbioses involving bleaching
   susceptible coral genera with latitude. This could partly explain the
   low impacts of bleaching episodes in the South Western Indian Ocean. In
   order to substantiate this, we suggest long term monitoring of
   coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbioses in the WIO region. Such monitoring
   should take advantage of genetic approaches that can decipher the fine
   scale diversity of Symbiodiniaceae in coral tissues within a changing
   climate.

AB In the absence of instrumental records, shell growth increments of
   bivalves are used to build continuous multi-decadal time series of
   growth and to estimate environmental variability. While there is
   interest in such chronologies in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a
   lack of multi-decadal datasets of growth for marine species from the
   Southern Hemisphere. We assessed the potential of the clam Glycymeris
   longior as an environmental proxy archive for the mid-latitudes of the
   South Atlantic Ocean, by applying sclerochronological techniques on the
   shells of individuals from a coastal area in Northern Patagonia,
   Argentina. Growth of G. longior showed a synchronous pattern, and shells
   were cross dated. We demonstrated that G. longior shells can be used to
   generate a robust multi-decadal chronology. The chronology spanned for a
   period of 22 years, from 1990 to 2011. This chronology has the potential
   to be extended, given that the maximum longevity of the analysed shells
   was 69 years. Significant positive correlations were found between the
   chronology and sea surface temperature and the Southern Annular Mode
   index. The sclerochronological approach performed in this study is a
   first step toward a long-term understanding of the links between climate
   and growth patterns of bivalves in temperate regions of SW Atlantic
   Ocean, under a long-term perspective.

AB The canonical drivers of population genetic structure, or spatial
   genetic variation, are isolation by distance and isolation by
   environment. Isolation by distance predicts that neighboring populations
   will be genetically similar and geographically distant populations will
   be genetically distinct [1]. Numerous examples also exist of isolation
   by environment, a phenomenon in which populations that inhabit similar
   environments (e.g., same elevation, temperature, or vegetation) are
   genetically similar even if they are distant, whereas populations that
   inhabit different environments are genetically distinct even when
   geographically close [2-4]. These dual models provide a widely accepted
   conceptual framework for understanding population structure [5-8]. Here,
   we present evidence for an additional, novel process that we call
   isolation by navigation, in which the navigational mechanism used by a
   long-distance migrant influences population structure independently of
   isolation by either distance or environment. Specifically, we
   investigated the population structure of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta
   caretta) [9], which return to nest on their natal beaches by seeking out
   unique magnetic signatures along the coast-a behavior known as
   geomagnetic imprinting [10-12]. Results reveal that spatial variation in
   Earth's magnetic field strongly predicts genetic differentiation between
   nesting beaches, even when environmental similarities and geographic
   proximity are taken into account. The findings provide genetic
   corroboration of geomagnetic imprinting [10, 13]. Moreover, they provide
   strong evidence that geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation help
   shape the population structure of sea turtles and perhaps numerous other
   long-distance migrants that return to their natal areas to reproduce
   [13-17].

AB Using half-sib analysis, we analysed the consequences of extreme rearing
   temperatures on genetic and phenotypic variations in the morphological
   and life-history traits of Drosophila ananassae. Paternal half-sib
   covariance contains a relatively small proportion of the epistatic
   variance and lacks the dominance variance and variance due to maternal
   effect, which provides more reliable estimates of additive genetic
   variance. Experiments were performed on a mass culture population of D.
   ananassae collected from Kanniyakumari (India). Two extremely stressful
   temperatures (18A degrees C and 32A degrees C) and one standard
   temperature (25A degrees C) were used to examine the effect of stressful
   and non-stressful environments on the morphological and life-history
   traits in males and females. Mean values of various morphological traits
   differed significantly among different temperature regimens in both
   males and females. Rearing at 18A degrees C and 32A degrees C resulted
   in decreased thorax length, wing-to-thorax (w/t) ratio, sternopleural
   bristle number, ovariole number, sex comb-tooth number and testis
   length. Phenotypic variances increased under stressful temperatures in
   comparison with non-stressful temperatures. Heritability and
   evolvability based on among-sires (males), among-dams (females), and the
   sum of the two components (sire + dam) showed higher values at both the
   stressful temperatures than at the non-stressful temperature. These
   differences reflect changes in additive genetic variance. Viability was
   greater at the high than the low extreme temperature. As viability is an
   indicator of stress, we can assume that stress was greater at 18A
   degrees C than at 32A degrees C in D. ananassae. The genetic variations
   for all the quantitative and life-history traits were higher at low
   temperature. Variation in sexual traits was more pronounced as compared
   with other morphometric traits, which shows that sexual traits are more
   prone to thermal stress. Our results agree with the hypothesis that
   genetic variation is increased in stressful environments.

AB Asexual lineages can grow at a faster rate than sexual lineages. Why
   then is sexual reproduction so widespread? Much empirical evidence
   supports the Red Queen hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, coevolving
   parasites favour sexual reproduction by adapting to infect common
   asexual clones and driving them down in frequency. One limitation,
   however, seems to challenge the generality of the Red Queen: in
   theoretical models, parasites must be very virulent to maintain sex.
   Moreover, experiments show virulence to be unstable, readily shifting in
   response to environmental conditions. Does variation in virulence
   further limit the ability of coevolving parasites to maintain sex? To
   address this question, we simulated temporal variation in virulence and
   evaluated the outcome of competition between sexual and asexual females.
   We found that variation in virulence did not limit the ability of
   coevolving parasites to maintain sex. In fact, relatively high variation
   in virulence promoted parasite-mediated maintenance of sex. With
   sufficient variation, sexual females persisted even when mean virulence
   fell well below the threshold virulence required to maintain sex under
   constant conditions. We conclude that natural variation in virulence
   does not limit the relevance of the Red Queen hypothesis for natural
   populations; on the contrary, it could expand the range of conditions
   over which coevolving parasites can maintain sex.

AB There is considerable variation among studies that evaluate how
   amphibian populations respond to global climate change. We used 23 years
   of annual survey data to test whether changes in climate have caused
   predictable shifts in the phenology and population characteristics of
   adult spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) during spring breeding
   migrations. Although we observed year-to-year correlation between
   seasonal climate variables and salamander population characteristics,
   there have not been long-term, directional shifts in phenological or
   population characteristics. Warm winters consistently resulted in early
   migration dates, but across the 23-year study, there was no overall
   shift towards warmer winters and thus no advanced migration timing. Warm
   summers and low variability in summer temperatures were correlated with
   large salamander body sizes, yet an overall shift towards increasing
   body sizes was not observed despite rising summer temperatures during
   the study. This was likely due to the absence of long-term changes of
   within-year variation in summer temperatures, which was a stronger
   determinant of body size than summer temperature alone. Climate-induced
   shifts in population characteristics were thus not observed for this
   species as long-term changes in important seasonal climate variables
   were not observed during the 23-years of the study. Different amphibian
   populations will likely be more resilient to climate change impacts than
   others, and the probability of amphibians exhibiting long-term
   population changes will depend on how seasonal climate change interacts
   with a species' life history, phenology, and geographic location.
   Linking a wide range of seasonal climatic conditions to species or
   population characteristics should thus improve our ability for
   explaining idiosyncratic responses of species to climate change.

AB Elevated in-stream temperature has led to a surge in the occurrence of
   parasitic intrusion proliferative kidney disease and has resulted in
   fish kills throughout Switzerland's waterways. Data from distributed
   temperature sensing (DTS) in-stream measurements for three cloud-free
   days in August 2007 over a 1260 m stretch of the Boiron de Morges River
   in southwest Switzerland were used to calibrate and validate a
   physically based one-dimensional stream temperature model. Stream
   temperature response to three distinct riparian conditions were then
   modeled: open, in-stream reeds, and forest cover. Simulation predicted a
   mean peak stream temperature increase of 0.7 degrees C if current
   vegetation was removed, an increase of 0.1 degrees C if dense reeds
   covered the entire stream reach, and a decrease of 1.2 degrees C if a
   mature riparian forest covered the entire reach. Understanding that full
   vegetation canopy cover is the optimal riparian management option for
   limiting stream temperature, in-stream reeds, which require no riparian
   set-aside and grow very quickly, appear to provide substantial thermal
   control, potentially useful for land-use management.

AB Studies focusing on physiological variation among individuals, and its
   possible evolutionary consequences, are scarce. A trait can only be a
   target of natural selection if it is consistent over time, that is, a
   trait must be repeatable. In ectotherms it has been suggested that
   standard metabolic rate (MR) is related to Darwinian fitness, since it
   reflects energy usage and expenditure. The metabolic rate of the cricket
   Hophlosphyrum griseus was determined at three ambient temperatures.
   Repeatability of MR was estimated by product-moment correlation on
   residuals of body mass, as well as the thermal sensitivity of MR on an
   individual basis (individual Q(10)). The MR of H. griseus was
   significantly repeatable (r=0.53) and highly dependent on ambient
   temperature, and its sensitivity (Q(10)) was dependent on the
   temperature range. Our estimation of MR repeatability was high in
   comparison to published studies in vertebrates. Ours is the second
   report of repeatability (i.e. consistency over time of an individual's
   performance ranking within a population) of any aspect of energy
   metabolism in an insect, and also the first study to report significant
   repeatability of MR. Individual Q(10) values revealed important
   interindividual variation, which reflects the existence of
   intrapopulational variability in the thermal sensitivity of MR. In
   addition, individual Q(10) values were negatively correlated between
   temperature ranges. This means that crickets having low Q(10) at low
   temperatures, presented high Q(10) at high temperatures, and vice versa.
   Our results suggest that MR could be of selective value in insects,
   showing consistency over time and intrapopulational variability in its
   thermal dependence. Nevertheless, its heritability remains to be
   determined.

AB Widespread species often show geographic variation in
   thermally-sensitive traits, providing insight into how species respond
   to shifts in temperature through time. Such patterns may arise from
   phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaptation, or their interaction. In some
   cases, the effects of genotype and temperature may act together to
   reduce, or to exacerbate, phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits
   across varying thermal environments. We find evidence for such
   interactions in life-history traits of Heteronympha merope, a butterfly
   distributed across a broad latitudinal gradient in south-eastern
   Australia. We show that body size in this butterfly is negatively
   related to developmental temperature in the laboratory, in accordance
   with the temperature-size rule, but not in the field, despite very
   strong temperature gradients. A common garden experiment on larval
   thermal responses, spanning the environmental extremes of H. merope's
   distribution, revealed that butterflies from low latitude (warmer
   climate) populations have relatively fast intrinsic growth and
   development rates compared to those from cooler climates. These
   synergistic effects of genotype and temperature across the landscape
   (co-gradient variation) are likely to accentuate phenotypic variation in
   these traits, and this interaction must be accounted for when predicting
   how H. merope will respond to temperature change through time. These
   results highlight the importance of understanding how variation in
   life-history traits may arise in response to environmental change.
   Without this knowledge, we may fail to detect whether organisms are
   tracking environmental change, and if they are, whether it is by
   plasticity, adaptation or both.

AB The timing of flowering is determined by endogenous genetic components
   as well as various environmental factors, such as day length,
   temperature, and stress. The genetic elements and molecular mechanisms
   that rule this process have been examined in the long-day-flowering
   plant Arabidopsis thaliana and short-day-flowering rice (Oryza sativa).
   However, reviews of research on the role of those factors are limited.
   Here, we focused on how flowering time is influenced by nutrients,
   ambient temperature, drought, salinity, exogenously applied hormones and
   chemicals, and pathogenic microbes. In response to such stresses or
   stimuli, plants either begin flowering to produce seeds for the next
   generation or else delay flowering by slowing their metabolism. These
   responses vary depending upon the dose of the stimulus, the plant
   developmental stage, or even the cultivar that is used. Our review
   provides insight into how crops might be managed to increase
   productivity under various environmental challenges.

AB Fruit initiation in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana) is generally
   repressed until fertilization occurs. However, mutations in AUXIN
   RESPONSE FACTOR8 (ARF8) uncouple fruit initiation from fertilization,
   resulting in the formation of seedless, parthenocarpic fruit. Here we
   induced parthenocarpy in wild-type Arabidopsis by introducing either the
   mutant genomic ( g) Atarf8-4 sequence or gAtARF8:beta-glucuronidase
   translational fusion constructs by plant transformation. Silencing of
   endogenous AtARF8 transcription was not observed, indicating that the
   introduced, aberrant ARF8 transcripts were compromising the function of
   endogenous ARF8 and/or associated factors involved in suppressing fruit
   initiation. To analyze the role of ARF8 in tomato ( Solanum
   lycopersicum) we initially emasculated 23 tomato cultivars to test for
   background parthenocarpy. Surprisingly, all had a predisposition to
   initiate fertilization-independent fruit growth. Expression of gAtarf8-4
   in transgenic tomato ('Monalbo') resulted in a significant increase in
   the number and size of parthenocarpic fruit. Isolation of tomato ARF8
   cDNA indicated significant sequence conservation with AtARF8. SlARF8 may
   therefore control tomato fruit initiation in a similar manner as AtARF8
   does in Arabidopsis. Two SlARF8 cDNAs differing in size by 5 bp were
   found, both arising from the same gene. The smaller cDNA is a splice
   variant and is also present in Arabidopsis. We propose that low
   endogenous levels of the splice variant products might interfere with
   efficient formation/function of a complex repressing fruit initiation,
   thereby providing an explanation for the observed ovary expansion in
   tomato and also Arabidopsis after emasculation. Increasing the levels of
   aberrant Atarf8-4 transcripts may further destabilize formation/function
   of the complex in a dosage-dependent manner enhancing tomato
   parthenocarpic fruit initiation frequency and size and mimicking the
   parthenocarpic dehiscent silique phenotype found in homozygous Atarf8-4
   mutants. Collectively these data suggest that similar mechanisms
   involving auxin signaling exist to inhibit parthenocarpic fruit set in
   tomato and Arabidopsis.

AB Calling behaviour is strongly temperature-dependent and critical for
   sexual selection and reproduction in a variety of ectothermic taxa,
   including anuran amphibians, which are the most globally threatened
   vertebrates. However, few studies have explored how species respond to
   distinct thermal environments at time of displaying calling behaviour,
   and thus it is still unknown whether ongoing climate change might
   compromise the performance of calling activity in ectotherms. Here, we
   used new audio-trapping techniques (automated sound recording and
   detection systems) between 2006 and 2009 to examine annual calling
   temperatures of five temperate anurans and their patterns of
   geographical and seasonal variation at the thermal extremes of species
   ranges, providing insights into the thermal breadths of calling activity
   of species, and the mechanisms that enable ectotherms to adjust to
   changing thermal environments. All species showed wide thermal breadths
   during calling behaviour (above 15 degrees C) and increases in calling
   temperatures in extremely warm populations and seasons. Thereby, calling
   temperatures differed both geographically and seasonally, both in
   terrestrial and aquatic species, and were 8-22 degrees C below the
   specific upper critical thermal limits (CTmax) and strongly associated
   with the potential temperatures of each thermal environment (operative
   temperatures during the potential period of breeding). This suggests
   that calling behaviour in ectotherms may take place at
   population-specific thermal ranges, diverging when species are subjected
   to distinct thermal environments, and might imply plasticity of thermal
   adjustment mechanisms (seasonal and developmental acclimation) that
   supply species with means of coping with climate change. Furthermore,
   the thermal thresholds of calling at the onset of the breeding season
   were dissimilar between conspecific populations, suggesting that other
   factors besides temperature are needed to trigger the onset of
   reproduction. Our findings imply that global warming would not directly
   inhibit calling behaviour in the study species, although might affect
   other temperature-dependent features of their acoustic communication
   system.

AB The phenotypic variance is assumed to be greater in a more heterogeneous

   (Chelydra serpentina) to a split-family design to evaluate the
   variability in incubation time and four size traits of neonates from

   measurements were similar between the laboratory and the field, but
   incubation time was systematically longer in the field. We found no
   tendency among clutches for hatchlings resulting from eggs incubated in
   laboratory or field environments to demonstrate greater variability.
   Also contrary to expectation, clutches that experienced greater thermal
   variation in the field did not exhibit greater variation in phenotypic
   traits. Consequently, extrapolating results from the laboratory to the
   field may not always be problematic for microevolutionary analyses.

AB The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America provide valuable ecosystem
   services, including fisheries, to the surrounding population. Given the
   prevalence of other anthropogenic stressors that have historically
   affected the fisheries of the Great Lakes (e.g., eutrophication,
   invasive species, overfishing), climate change is often viewed as a
   long-term stressor and, subsequently, may not always be prioritized by
   managers and researchers. However, climate change has the potential to
   negatively affect fish and fisheries in the Great Lakes through its
   influence on habitat. In this paper, we (1) summarize projected changes
   in climate and fish habitat in the Great Lakes; (2) summarize fish
   responses to climate change in the Great Lakes; (3) describe key
   interactions between climate change and other stressors relevant to
   Great Lakes fish, and (4) summarize how climate change can be
   incorporated into fisheries management. In general, fish habitat is
   projected to be characterized by warmer temperatures throughout the
   water column, less ice cover, longer periods of stratification, and more
   frequent and widespread periods of bottom hypoxia in productive areas of
   the Great Lakes. Based solely on thermal habitat, fish populations
   theoretically could experience prolonged optimal growth environment
   within a changing climate, however, models that assess physical habitat
   influences at specific life stages convey a more complex picture.
   Looking at specific interactions with other stressors, climate change
   may exacerbate the negative impacts of both eutrophication and invasive
   species for fish habitat in the Great Lakes. Although expanding
   monitoring and research to consider climate change interactions with
   currently studied stressors, may offer managers the best opportunity to
   keep the valuable Great Lakes fisheries sustainable, this expansion is
   globally applicable for large lake ecosystem dealing with multiple
   stressors in the face of continued human-driven changes.

AB Marine ecosystems are already responding to climate change, with
   examples found in virtually all of the world's oceans. Although there is
   not a singular response of marine amniotes to climate change, individual
   observations indicate three kinds of interrelated responses of marine
   amniotes: distribution shifts (geographic ranges), phenological changes
   (timing of seasonal activities) and inter-specific interactions
   including competition between species and the predator-prey system
   dynamics. If global sea temperature increases in the future, the
   expected patterns are that tropical marine amniotes species will extend
   their ranges and temperate ones will move to higher latitudes;
   reproductive events will occur earlier and migratory timing will show
   delays; and the trophic breath of some organisms will progressively
   change, particularly in low trophic species. It is expected that strict
   polar and endemic species will be the most affected by climate change.
   However, confidence levels in that such patterns will be fulfilled are
   low, as they are not a univocal response to climate change. In this
   group, it is more likely that the detected effects on individual species
   be related to processes dependent upon climate variations, such as
   changes in habitat structure (sea ice) and food availability, either of
   natural or human origin.

AB Background: The association between temperature and mortality has been
   examined mainly in North America and Europe. However, less evidence is
   available in developing countries, especially in Thailand. In this
   study, we examined the relationship between temperature and mortality in
   Chiang Mai city, Thailand, during 1999-2008.
   Method: A time series model was used to examine the effects of
   temperature on cause-specific mortality (non-external, cardiopulmonary,
   cardiovascular, and respiratory) and age-specific non-external mortality
   (<=64, 65-74, 75-84, and >=85 years), while controlling for relative
   humidity, air pollution, day of the week, season and long-term trend. We
   used a distributed lag non-linear model to examine the delayed effects
   of temperature on mortality up to 21 days.
   Results: We found non-linear effects of temperature on all mortality
   types and age groups. Both hot and cold temperatures resulted in
   immediate increase in all mortality types and age groups. Generally, the
   hot effects on all mortality types and age groups were short-term, while
   the cold effects lasted longer. The relative risk of non-external
   mortality associated with cold temperature (19.35 degrees C, 1st
   percentile of temperature) relative to 24.7 degrees C (25th percentile
   of temperature) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 1.44) for
   lags 0-21. The relative risk of non-external mortality associated with
   high temperature (31.7 degrees C, 99th percentile of temperature)
   relative to 28 degrees C (75th percentile of temperature) was 1.11 (95%
   CI: 1.00, 1.24) for lags 0-21.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that exposure to both hot and cold
   temperatures were related to increased mortality. Both cold and hot
   effects occurred immediately but cold effects lasted longer than hot
   effects. This study provides useful data for policy makers to better
   prepare local responses to manage the impact of hot and cold
   temperatures on population health.

AB Elucidating the combined effects of increasing temperature and ocean
   acidification on performance of fishes is central to our understanding
   of how species will respond to global climate change. Measuring the
   metabolic costs associated with intense and short activities, such as
   those required to escape predators, is key to quantifying changes in
   performance and estimating the potential effects of environmental
   stressors on survival. In this study, juvenile little skate Leucoraja
   erinacea from two neighboring locations (Gulf of Maine, or northern
   location, and Georges Bank, or southern location) were developmentally
   acclimatized and reared at current and projected temperatures (15, 18 or
   20 degrees C) and acidification conditions (pH 8.1 or 7.7), and their
   escape performance was tested by employing a chasing protocol. The
   results from this study suggest countergradient variation in growth
   between skates from the two locations, while the optimum for escape
   performance was at a lower temperature in individuals from the northern
   latitudes, which could be related to adaptation to the local thermal
   environment. Aerobic performance and scope declined in skates from the
   northern latitudes under simulated ocean warming and acidification
   conditions. Overall, the southern skates showed lower sensitivity to
   these climatic stressors. This study demonstrates that even mobile
   organisms from neighboring locations can exhibit substantial differences
   in energetic costs of exercise and that skates from the northern part of
   the geographic range may be more sensitive to the directional increase
   in temperature and acidification expected by the end of the century.

AB Intertidal organisms have evolved physiological mechanisms that enable
   them to maintain performance and survive during periods of severe
   environmental stress with temperatures close to their tolerance limits.
   The level of these adaptive responses in thermal physiology can vary
   among populations of broadly distributed species depending on their
   particular environmental context and genetic backgrounds. Here we
   examined thermal performances and reaction norms for metabolic rate (MR)
   and heart rate (HR) of seven populations of the porcelanid crab
   Petrolisthes violaceus from markedly different thermal environments
   across the latitudinal gradient of similar to 3000 km. Physiological
   responses of this intertidal crab under common-garden conditions suggest
   the absence of local thermal adaptation along the geographic gradient
   (i.e., lack of latitudinal compensation). Moreover, thermal
   physiological sensitivities and performances in response to increased
   temperatures evidenced the existence of some level of: i) metabolic rate
   control or depression during warm temperature exposures; and ii)
   homeostasis/canalization (i.e., absence or low levels of plasticity) in
   physiological traits that may reflect some sort of buffering mechanism
   in most of the populations. Nevertheless, our results indicate that
   elevated temperatures can reduce cardiac function but not metabolic rate
   in high latitude crabs. The lack of congruence between HR and MR
   supports the idea that energy metabolism in marine invertebrates cannot
   be inferred from HR and different conclusions regarding geographic
   differentiation in energy metabolism can be obtained from both
   physiological traits. Integrating thermal physiology and species range
   extent can contribute to a better understanding of the likely effects of
   climate change on natural populations of marine ectotherms.

AB American lobster (Homarus americanus) supports one of the most valuable
   regional fisheries in the United States, with its abundance and
   distribution profoundly influenced by environmental conditions. To
   explain how lobster distribution has changed over time and assess the
   role of environmental variables on these changes, we used random forest
   classification and regression tree models to estimate occupancy and
   biomass in two seasonal periods. The occupancy models were fit to static
   and dynamic variables, which yielded model fits with AUC scores of 0.80
   and 0.78 for spring and fall, respectively. Biomass models were fit with
   the same data and resulted in models explaining 61% and 63% of the
   spring and fall biomass variance, respectively. Significant variables
   scored in the formation of the regression trees were secondary
   productivity (i.e., zooplankton), bathymetry characteristics, and
   temperature. American lobster suitable habitat has changed regionally;
   habitat has increased in the Gulf of Maine and declined in Southern New
   England. There is also evidence of declining habitat along the inshore
   margin of the Gulf of Maine, which has been accompanied by a shift in
   occupancy probability offshore. Habitat suitability results from the
   random forest models provide insights on the structure and function of
   lobster habitat and context to understand recent population trends.

AB One of the most important events in vertebrate evolution was the
   acquisition of endothermy, the ability to use metabolic heat production
   to elevate body temperature above environmental temperature. Several
   verbal models have been proposed to explain the selective factors
   leading to the evolution of endothermy. Of these, the aerobic capacity
   model has received the most attention in recent years. The aerobic
   capacity model postulates that selection acted mainly to increase
   maximal aerobic capacity (or associated behavioral abilities) and that
   elevated resting metabolic rate evolved as a correlated response. Here
   we evaluate the implicit evolutionary and genetic assumptions of the
   aerobic capacity model. In light of this evaluation, we assess the
   utility of phenotypic and genetic correlations for testing the aerobic
   capacity model. Collectively, the available intraspecific data for
   terrestrial vertebrates support the notion of a positive phenotypic
   correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption
   within species. Interspecific analyses provide mixed support for this
   phenotypic correlation. We argue, however, that assessments of
   phenotypic or genetic correlations within species and evolutionary
   correlations among species (from comparative data) are of limited
   utility, because they may not be able to distinguish between the aerobic
   capacity model and plausible alternatives, such as selection acting
   directly on aspects of thermoregulatory abilities. We suggest six
   sources of information that may help shed light on the selective factors
   important during the evolution of high aerobic metabolic rates and,
   ultimately, the attainment of endothermy. Of particular interest will be
   attempts to determine, using a combination of mechanistic physiological
   and quantitative-genetic approaches, whether a positive genetic
   correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption is
   an ineluctable feature of vertebrate physiology.

AB Pulmonate land snails are often polymorphic in their shell coloration
   pattern. To quantify the contribution of environmental parameters to the
   nondirectional change in phenotypic variation, we used a historic
   dataset on Theba pisana morph frequencies and climate data for
   statistical modelling. We found significant correlations of the degree
   of phenotypic diversity between juveniles and corresponding adult
   individuals within the same and the subsequent generation. Among climate
   parameters, the phenotypic diversity of adults correlated significantly
   and positively with the mean and maximum ambient temperatures in the
   winter and spring only. There was no correlation between high or low
   temperatures and the frequency of distinct morphs. Akaike's information
   criterion-based model selection revealed the particular importance of
   only parental phenotypic diversity for next generation juvenile
   phenotypic diversity. By contrast, phenotypic diversity of the juveniles
   of the preceding year and the mean temperatures in winter and spring
   were important for the phenotypic diversity of adult snails.
   Approximately two-thirds of the explicable variation in phenotypic
   diversity of adults was explained by inheritance and approximately
   one-third was expained by ambient temperature. The present study shows
   that genetics and temperature interact to generate nondirectional
   changes in phenotypic variation within populations, which also can be
   reflected by changes in the phenotype of individuals.(c) 2013 The

AB A typical explanation for ecologically stable strategies that apply to
   only a proportion of a population, is bet hedging, where increased
   reproductive success offsets reduced reproductive rate. One such is
   partial migration, where only a proportion of a population moves
   seasonally to avoid inclement climatic conditions. Bet hedging may
   overlook unseen costs to maintain broad physiological resilience,
   implied by encountering a breadth of environmental conditions. We
   investigated the physiological correlates of partial migration by
   measuring standard metabolic rates, and rates of evaporative water loss,
   and then estimating upper and lower thermal tolerance in males and
   females of two hoverfiy species, Episyrphus balteatus and Eristalis
   tenax. In central Europe, females of these species may either migrate or
   overwinter, whereas males may migrate south to the Mediterranean, but
   have not been found overwintering. Both species were sexually dimorphic;
   female Ep. balteatus were lighter than males, but female Er. tenax were
   heavier than males. While allometrically- corrected metabolic rate in
   both species increased with temperature, the most parsimonious models
   included no sex-specific differences in metabolic rate for either
   species. Evaporative water loss of both species also increased with
   temperature, but was higher for females of both species than males.
   Assuming that resting metabolism is congruent with the activity
   requirements of migration, highly consistent thermal tolerance and
   metabolic rate suggests that any given fly could migrate, although water
   loss patterns suggest that females may be less well-adapted to
   Mediterranean climates. We infer that partial migration probably results
   from the imperatives of their reproductive strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Freshwater crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, caught in the winter
   when water temperature was 5 degrees C, were acclimated in the
   laboratory to 5 degrees C for 1 week and to 1 and 12 degrees C for 1
   month before haemolymph and tissue samples were taken for acid-base
   analysis. In vivo, haemolymph (extracellular) pH increased by 0.14 units
   between 5 and 1 degrees C but remained unchanged between 5 and 12
   degrees C, giving an overall Delta pHe/Delta t value of -0.009 pH units
   degrees C-1 and an [H+] value of +3.3 nmoll(-1). Haemolymph withdrawn
   from crayfish acclimated to 1 degrees C and warmed anaerobically in
   vitro to 12 degrees C had a Delta pHe/Delta t value of -0.010 pH units
   degrees C-1. This was depressed compared with the values of -0.015 and
   -0.016 pH units degrees C-1 obtained from haemolymph withdrawn from
   crayfish held at 5 and 12 degrees C, respectively, but changes in H+
   concentration were similar in all three groups. There was little change
   in intracellular pH with rise in temperature in either claw muscle
   (Delta pHi/Delta t = -0.003 pH units degrees C-1) or hepatopancreas
   (Delta pHi/Delta t = -0.006 pH units degrees C-1). In the heart, Delta
   pHi/Delta t paralleled that in the haemolymph (-0.010 pH units degrees
   C-1), but the largest change was found in the abdominal muscle (-0.025
   pH units degrees C-1). In all tissues apart from claw muscle, there was
   a metabolic acidosis, with an increase in metabolic acid load as
   temperature rose from 1 to 12 degrees C. The depressed in vivo Delta
   pHe/Delta t value and the differences in Delta pHi/Delta t between the
   tissues were attributed to active regulation of pHi, possibly to control
   enzyme function in the intracellular compartments. Tissues that are
   functionally important in the winter months, such as abdominal muscle,
   followed alphastat regulation, whereas tissues that are less active in
   the winter, such as claw muscle and hepatopancreas, maintained pHi
   irrespective of temperature, resulting in a relatively acidotic pHi,
   which may serve to depress the activity of metabolic enzymes.

AB Incubating birds must trade-off leaving the nest to forage with staying
   on the nest to maintain optimal temperatures for developing embryos.
   This trade-off is expressed through incubation behavior, which can be
   heavily influenced by climate, food availability, attentiveness of their
   mates, and nest predation risk. Comparative studies across species have
   shown that incubation behavior varies across latitude, but few studies
   have explored how incubation behavior varies across sites within
   species. We might expect incubation behavior to be flexible and respond
   to local environmental challenges; alternatively, behavior may be
   relatively fixed and vary little across a species' range. We explored
   four incubation behaviors (male feeding rate, female off-bout duration,
   female off-bout frequency, and the proportion of time incubating females
   spent on the nest) in a widespread songbird, the yellow warbler
   (Setophaga petechia), breeding at a temperate and subarctic site. As
   temperatures warmed at both sites, males fed females less often, and as
   male feeding rates decreased, off-bout durations and frequencies
   increased causing the proportion of time on the nest to decrease. While
   incubation behaviors changed in similar ways between sites, off-bout
   durations shortened with increasing male feeding rates most strongly at
   the temperate site. Overall, these results show flexibility in
   incubation behaviors in response to different environmental cues, which
   likely minimize costs associated with provisioning incubating parents
   and maintaining warm nest temperatures, and suggests that male feeding
   may be especially important for breeding in cold regions.

   dependence of citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate
   kinase activity was relatively low (Q(10) = 1.20-1.68) over the range of
   temperatures experienced by turtles during summer and winter, and there

   juvenile green turtles experience only moderate changes in metabolism
   within the temperature range and environmental conditions experienced
   seasonally at this subtropical site.

AB One of the most widely recognized generalizations in biology is
   Bergmann's rule, the observation that, within species of birds and
   mammals, body size tends to be inversely related to ambient temperature.
   Recent studies indicate that turtles and salamanders also tend to follow
   Bergmann's rule, which hints that this species-level tendency originated
   early in tetrapod history. Furthermore, exceptions to Bergmann's rule
   are concentrated within squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes),
   suggesting that the tendency to express a Bergmann's rule cline may be
   heritable at the species level. We evaluated species-level heritability
   and early origination of Bergmann's rule by mapping size-latitude
   relationships for 352 species onto a tetrapod phylogeny. When the
   largest available dataset is used, Bergmann's rule shows significant
   phylogenetic signal, indicating species-level heritability. This
   represents one of the few demonstrations of heritability for an emergent
   species-level property and the first for an ecogeographic rule. When
   species are discretely coded as showing either Bergmann's rule or its
   converse, parsimony reconstructions suggest that: (1) the tendency to
   follow Bergmann's rule is ancestral for tetrapods, and (2) most extant
   species that express the rule have retained this tendency from that
   ancient ancestor. The first inference also generally holds when the
   discrete data or size-latitude correlation coefficients are analyzed
   using maximum likelihood, although the results are only statistically
   significant for some versions of the discrete analyses. The best
   estimates of ancestral states suggest that the traditional adaptive
   explanation for Bergmann's rule-conservation of metabolic heat-was not
   involved in the origin of the trait since that origin predates the
   evolution of endothermy. A more general thermoregulatory hypothesis
   could apply to endotherms and some ectotherms, but fails to explain why
   salamanders have retained Bergmann's rule. Thus, if thermoregulation
   underlies the origin of a Bergmann's rule tendency, this trait may have
   been continuously maintained while its cause changed. Alternatively,
   thermoregulation may not underlie Bergmann's rule in any tetrapod group.
   The results also suggest that many extinct groups not included in our
   analyses followed Bergmann's rule.

AB Temperature is a primary determinant of biogeographic patterns and
   ecosystem processes. Standard techniques to study the ocean temperature
   in situ are, however, particularly limited by their time and spatial
   coverage, problems which might be partially mitigated by using marine
   top predators as biological platforms for oceanographic sampling. We
   used small archival tags deployed on 33 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus
   magellanicus), and obtained 21,070 geo-localized profiles of water
   temperature, during late spring of 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013; in a
   region of the North Patagonian Sea with limited oceanographic records in
   situ. We compared our in situ data of sea surface temperature (SST) with
   those available from satellite remote sensing; to describe the
   three-dimensional temperature fields around the area of influence of two
   important tidal frontal systems; and to study the inter-annual variation
   in the three-dimensional temperature fields. There was a strong positive
   relationship between satellite- and animal-derived SST data although
   there was an overestimation by remote-sensing by a maximum difference of
   +2 degrees C. Little inter-annual variability in the 3-dimensional
   temperature fields was found, with the exception of 2012 (and to a
   lesser extent in 2013) where the SST was significantly higher. In 2013,
   we found weak stratification in a region which was unexpected. In
   addition, during the same year, a warm small-scale vortex is indicated
   by the animal-derived temperature data. This allowed us to describe and
   better understand the dynamics of the water masses, which, so far, have
   been mainly studied by remote sensors and numerical models. Our results
   highlight again the potential of using marine top predators as
   biological platforms to collect oceanographic data, which will enhance
   and accelerate studies on the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. In a changing
   world, threatened by climate change, it is urgent to fill information
   gaps on the coupled ocean-atmosphere system allowing to link the
   hydrothermal process to the at-sea distribution of top predators. (C)

AB Many species vary in their ecology across their geographic ranges in
   response to gradients in environmental conditions. Such variation, which
   can influence life history traits and subsequent demography of
   populations, usually occurs over large spatial scales. However,
   describing and understanding the causes of such variation is difficult
   precisely because it occurs over such large spatial scales. In this
   study, we document spatial variation in the ecology of a common reef
   fish, Stegastes beebei, in the Galapagos Islands and test a number of
   potential causal mechanisms. The pattern resembles that seen in
   latitudinal variation: individuals are larger, occur in higher
   densities, and live longer in the coldest region of the islands than
   those in the warmest region. However, in this system, demography varies
   among regional populations separated by < 150 km. Preferred nutritious
   algae are more available in the cold region and comprise a greater
   proportion of the diet of fish in this region. Per gram reproductive
   effort appears to be strongly related to temperature, despite
   differences in the gross magnitude and timing of reproduction in
   different regions. A model of reproductive output suggests that fish in
   the warmest region are allocating a greater proportion of available
   energy to reproduction, resulting in apparent regional life history
   tradeoffs. Our data suggest that regional demographic differences in S.
   beebei may be driven by a combination of variation in food availability
   and an environmentally mediated life history tradeoff.

AB Accurately assessing the impact of climate changes on tree growth or
   forest productivity is vital to better understand global carbon cycles.
   Here, we carried out dendroclimatological research on Yezo spruce (Picea
   jezoensis var. microsperma) along an elevation gradient in two sites to
   investigate the effect of rapid warming on spruce growth in northeast
   China. Results indicated that trees at two low-elevation sites had
   significantly wider ring widths and higher basal area increment (BAI)
   compared with high-elevation sites. Ring widths and BAI of Yezo spruce
   at low elevations showed a clear growth increase during the 1940s-1970s
   followed by a significant decline after 1980. However, trees at high
   elevations showed a relatively stable growth during the 1940s-1970s
   followed by a significant increase after 1980. Rapid warming after 1980
   increased the radial growth of Yezo spruce at high-elevation sites, but
   reduced tree growth at low-elevation sites. Winter precipitation and
   growing season temperature were positively correlated with radial growth
   of Yezo spruce at high elevations, but negatively correlated with tree
   growth at low elevations. A clear pattern of growth and growth-climate
   relationship changed in 1980. The temperature threshold for determining
   the impact of climate on Yezo spruce could change with latitude or site.
   Difference in drought caused by warming may be the main reason for the
   opposite response of tree growing at different altitudes in northeast
   China. The mechanism of rapid warming driving contrasting growth at
   different elevations should also be investigated in other tree species
   in NE Asia. In the context of future climate warming, our findings are
   of great significance for tree growth in assessing forest dynamics and
   carbon cycling.

AB Evidence is accumulating that species' responses to climate changes are
   best predicted by modelling the interaction of physiological limits,
   biotic processes and the effects of dispersal-limitation. Using
   commercially harvested blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip abalone
   (Haliotis laevigata) as case studies, we determine the relative
   importance of accounting for interactions among physiology,
   metapopulation dynamics and exploitation in predictions of range
   (geographical occupancy) and abundance (spatially explicit density)
   under various climate change scenarios. Traditional correlative
   ecological niche models (ENM) predict that climate change will benefit
   the commercial exploitation of abalone by promoting increased abundances
   without any reduction in range size. However, models that account
   simultaneously for demographic processes and physiological responses to
   climate-related factors result in future (and present) estimates of area
   of occupancy (AOO) and abundance that differ from those generated by
   ENMs alone. Range expansion and population growth are unlikely for
   blacklip abalone because of important interactions between
   climate-dependent mortality and metapopulation processes; in contrast,
   greenlip abalone should increase in abundance despite a contraction in
   AOO. The strongly non-linear relationship between abalone population
   size and AOO has important ramifications for the use of ENM predictions
   that rely on metrics describing change in habitat area as proxies for
   extinction risk. These results show that predicting species' responses
   to climate change often require physiological information to understand
   climatic range determinants, and a metapopulation model that can make
   full use of this data to more realistically account for processes such
   as local extirpation, demographic rescue, source-sink dynamics and
   dispersal-limitation.

AB Although the potential to adapt to warmer climate is constrained by
   genetic trade-offs, our understanding of how selection and mutation
   shape genetic (co)variances in thermal reaction norms is poor. Using 71
   isofemale lines of the fly Sepsis punctum, originating from northern,
   central, and southern European climates, we tested for divergence in
   juvenile development rate across latitude at five experimental
   temperatures. To investigate effects of evolutionary history in
   different climates on standing genetic variation in reaction norms, we
   further compared genetic (co) variances between regions. Flies were
   reared on either high or low food resources to explore the role of
   energy acquisition in determining genetic trade-offs between different
   temperatures. Although the latter had only weak effects on the strength
   and sign of genetic correlations, genetic architecture differed
   significantly between climatic regions, implying that evolution of
   reaction norms proceeds via different trajectories at high latitude
   versus low latitude in this system. Accordingly, regional genetic
   architecture was correlated to region-specific differentiation.
   Moreover, hot development temperatures were associated with low genetic
   variance and stronger genetic correlations compared to cooler
   temperatures. We discuss the evolutionary potential of thermal reaction
   norms in light of their underlying genetic architectures, evolutionary
   histories, and the materialization of trade-offs in natural
   environments.

AB In recent decades, dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever have
   become a substantial public health concern in many subtropical and
   tropical countries throughout the world. Many of these regions have
   strong seasonal patterns in rainfall and temperature which are directly
   linked to the transmission of dengue through the mosquito vector
   population. Our study focuses on the development and analysis of a
   strongly seasonally forced, multi-subclass dengue model. This model is a
   compartment-based system of first-order ordinary differential equations
   with seasonal forcing in the vector population and also includes host
   population demographics. Our analysis of this model focuses particularly
   on the existence of deterministic chaos in regions of the parameter
   space which potentially hinders application of the model to predict and
   understand future outbreaks. The numerically efficient 0-1 test for
   deterministic chaos suggested by Gottwald and Melbourne (2004) [18] is
   used to analyze the long-term behaviour of the model as an alternative
   to Lyapunov exponents. Various solutions types were found to exist
   within the studied parameter range. Most notable are the existence of
   isola n-cycle solutions before the onset of deterministic chaos.
   Analysis of the seasonal model with the 0-1 test revealed the existence
   of three disconnected regions in parameter space where deterministic
   chaos exists in the single subclass model. Knowledge of these regions
   and how they relate to the parameters of the model gives greater
   confidence in the predictive power of the seasonal model. Crown

AB Whether marine fish will grow differently in future
   highpCO(2)environments remains surprisingly uncertain. Long-term and
   whole-life cycle effects are particularly unknown, because such
   experiments are logistically challenging, space demanding, exclude
   long-lived species, and require controlled, restricted feeding
   regimes-otherwise increased consumption could mask potential growth
   effects. Here, we report on repeated, long-term, food-controlled
   experiments to rear large populations (>4,000 individuals total) of the
   experimental model and ecologically important forage fishMenidia
   menidia(Atlantic silverside) under contrasting temperature (17 degrees,
   24 degrees, and 28 degrees C) andpCO(2)conditions (450 vs. similar to
   2,200 mu atm) from fertilization to similar to a third of this annual
   species' life span. Quantile analyses of trait distributions showed
   mostly negative effects of highpCO(2)on long-term growth. At 17 degrees
   C and 28 degrees C, but not at 24 degrees C, highpCO(2)fish were
   significantly shorter [17 degrees C: -5 to -9%; 28 degrees C: -3%] and
   weighed less [17 degrees C: -6 to -18%; 28 degrees C: -8%] compared to
   ambientpCO(2)fish. Reductions in fish weight were smaller than in
   length, which is why highpCO(2)fish at 17 degrees C consistently
   exhibited a higher Fulton'sk(weight/length ratio). Notably, it took more
   than 100 days of rearing for statistically significant length
   differences to emerge between treatment populations, showing that
   cumulative, long-term CO(2)effects could exist elsewhere but are easily
   missed by short experiments. Long-term rearing had another benefit: it
   allowed sexing the surviving fish, thereby enabling rare sex-specific
   analyses of trait distributions under contrasting CO(2)environments. We
   found that female silversides grew faster than males, but there was no
   interaction between CO(2)and sex, indicating that males and females were
   similarly affected by highpCO(2). Because Atlantic silversides are known
   to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, we also analyzed sex
   ratios, revealing no evidence for CO2-dependent sex determination in
   this species.

AB Automated soil CO2 efflux chamber measurements were carried out over a
   period of eight years in a young Norway spruce forest in the northeast
   region of the Czech Republic to determine seasonal and inter-annual
   variables affecting this flux. The data obtained was summarized and
   analysed with the aims of estimating long-term carbon losses from the
   soil and comparing selected models to determine the model best
   describing soil CO2 efflux. Our results show that seasonal variation in
   soil CO2 efflux was driven mainly by soil temperature, while
   inter-annual variation showed the closest relationship with
   precipitation. The total amount of carbon released from the soil into
   the atmosphere per season varied from 6.4 to 11.2 tC ha(-1) over the
   eight-year record. One of the variables used in the CO2 efflux models,
   beside environmental variables, was day of year (DOY). Incorporating
   this variable into models improved the estimation of soil CO2 efflux
   dynamics. Therefore, we assume that models incorporating DOY could be
   used effectively to gap-fill measured soil chamber data. These models
   could also be appropriate for filling longer gaps on a scale from days
   to weeks, because DOY, as a single parameter, covers up to 80% of
   variability in the data. This study also demonstrated the different
   levels of correlation between investigated climate variables and soil
   CO2 efflux at seasonal and inter-annual time scales. This highlights the
   importance of different environmental variables in interpreting
   long-term soil CO2 efflux data and also modelling the complexity of the
   processes connected with soil CO2 efflux in Norway spruce forest.

AB The yield and quality of food crops is central to the well being of
   humans and is directly affected by climate and weather. Initial studies
   of climate change on crops focussed on effects of increased carbon
   dioxide (CO2) level and/or global mean temperature and/or rainfall and
   nutrition on crop production. However, crops can respond nonlinearly to
   changes in their growing conditions, exhibit threshold responses and are
   subject to combinations of stress factors that affect their growth,
   development and yield. Thus, climate variability and changes in the
   frequency of extreme events are important for yield, its stability and
   quality. In this context, threshold temperatures for crop processes are
   found not to differ greatly for different crops and are important to
   define for the major food crops, to assist climate modellers predict the
   occurrence of crop critical temperatures and their temporal resolution.
   This paper demonstrates the impacts of climate variability for crop
   production in a number of crops. Increasing temperature and
   precipitation variability increases the risks to yield, as shown via
   computer simulation and experimental studies. The issue of food quality
   has not been given sufficient importance when assessing the impact of
   climate change for food and this is addressed. Using simulation models
   of wheat, the concentration of grain protein is shown to respond to
   changes in the mean and variability of temperature and precipitation
   events. The paper concludes with discussion of adaptation possibilities
   for crops in response to drought and argues that characters that enable
   better exploration of the soil and slower leaf canopy expansion could
   lead to crop higher transpiration efficiency.

AB GIGANTEA (GI) is a large nuclear protein which is involved in
   circadian-clock function, red-light signaling and photoperiodic
   flowering. Accumulation of GI transcript displays a strong diurnal
   pattern, and is under circadian-clock control, as demonstrated in
   several diverse species. Clock entrainment and compensation, as well as
   flowering time, are largely responsive to changes in the environment. We
   asked if part of this response is mediated through modification of GI
   expression. We identified a strong response of GI expression to changes
   in temperature and light, in both Arabidopsis and the model legume
   Medicago truncatula. Extreme temperatures resulted in increased GI
   trough levels. Light increased GI expression near dawn and the response
   to light appeared to be gated by the circadian clock. We provide
   evidence that the GI response to blue and far-red light requires
   CRYPTOCHROME function in Arabidopsis. Unknown roles for GI in both
   blue-light deetiolation and precocious flowering under warm short days
   were revealed. Plants seem to respond to changes in the environment
   partly through environmentally induced modifications of a basal
   clock-regulated pattern of GI transcript accumulation.

   several salient features including (a) a physiological basis that
   considers increasing the fraction of cells killed with increasing
   temperatures above a minimum therapeutic temperature (T-min,T-thera),
   (b) a term to penalize for heating of normal tissues above
   T-min,T-thera, and (c) a scalar weighting factor (gamma) that has
   treatment implications. Reasonable estimates for gamma are provided and
   their influence on the objective function is demonstrated. The cell-kill
   algorithm formulated in the objective function is based empirically upon
   the behavior of published hyperthermic cell-survival data. The objective
   function is shown to be independent of normal tissue size and shape when
   subjected to a known outer-surface, thermal boundary condition.
   Therefore, fractions of cells killed in tumors of different shapes and
   sizes tan be compared to determine the relative performance of
   thermoseed arrays to heat different tumors.
   Results: In simulations with an idealized tissue model perfused by blood
   at various rates, maxima of the objective function are unique and
   identify seed spacings and Curie-point temperatures that maximize the
   fraction of tumor cells killed. In ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatment
   planning, seed spacing can be based on maximizing the minimum tumor
   temperature and minimizing the maximum normal tissue temperature. It is
   shown that this treatment plan is less effective than a plan based on
   seed spacings that maximize the objective function.
   Conclusions: It is shown that under the assumptions of the model and
   based on a desired therapeutic goal, the objective function identifies a
   combination of thermoseed temperatures and locations that maximizes the
   fraction of tumor cells killed.

AB Aim
   The northern limits of temperate broadleaved species in Fennoscanndia
   are controlled by their requirements for summer warmth for successful
   regeneration and growth as well as by the detrimental effects of winter
   cold on plant tissue. However, occurrences of meteorological conditions
   with detrimental effects on individual species are rare events rather
   than a reflection of average conditions. We explore the effect of
   changes in inter-annual temperature variability on the abundances of the
   tree species Tilia cordata, Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra near their
   distribution limits using a process-based model of ecosystem dynamics.
   Location
   A site in central Sweden and a site in southern Finland were used as
   examples for the ecotone between boreal and temperate forests in
   Fennoscandia. The Finnish site was selected because of the availability
   of varve-thickness data.
   Methods
   The dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS was run with four scenarios of
   inter-annual temperature forcing for the last 10,000 years. In one
   scenario the variability in the thickness of summer and winter varves
   from the annually laminated lake in Finland was used as a proxy for past
   inter-annual temperature variability. Two scenarios were devised to
   explore systematically the effect of stepwise changes in the variance
   and shape parameter of a probability distribution. All variability
   scenarios were run both with and without the long-term trend in Holocene
   temperature change predicted by an atmospheric general circulation
   model.
   Results
   Directional changes in inter-annual temperature variability have
   significant effects on simulated tree distribution limits through time.
   Variations in inter-annual temperature variability alone are shown to
   alter vegetation composition by magnitudes similar to the magnitude of
   changes driven by variation in mean temperatures.
   Main conclusions
   The varve data indicate that inter-annual climate variability has
   changed in the past. The model results show that past changes in species
   abundance can be explained by changes in the inter-annual variability of
   climate parameters as well as by mean climate. Because inter-annual
   climatic variability is predicted to change in the future, this
   component of climate change should be taken into account both when
   making projections of future plant distributions and when interpreting
   vegetation history.

AB Climate-growth response of trees at different age groups is less studied
   in humid regions of central China. In this study, we divided Pinus
   armandii ring-width series collected from the Baiyunshan National Nature
   Reserve of central China into young and old age groups based on the
   Hierarchical cluster analysis. Chronology statistics indicate that mean
   sensitivity (M.S.), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and expressed
   population signal (EPS) are higher in the old age group than that in the
   young age group. Meanwhile, there is are growth difference between the
   two age groups during their common period 1966-2014. Trees in the old
   age group exhibit significant decadal (similar to 10-year) cycles in the
   1960s-1980s, while the 2-3-year cycles are more pronounced for the young
   age group. Correlation analysis between tree-rings and climate factors
   shows that the old trees generally contain more climatic information and
   are more sensitive to temperature, precipitation and moisture
   variability than the young trees, consistent with the chronology
   statistics. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the
   "juvenile effect" of young trees on tree-ring based climate
   reconstructions in the area.

AB The preference-performance hypothesis predicts that female insects
   should prefer to lay eggs in locations that enhance offspring
   performance. This study examines the choices of females regarding where
   to oviposit within plants, focusing on the hawkmoth Manduca sexta L.
   (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) and its host Datura wrightii Regel
   (Solanaceae) in the southwestern USA. Smaller Datura leaves provide
   cooler microclimates for eggs (which may lead to faster embryonic
   development, shortening their exposure to egg predators) and more
   nitrogen for larvae. In contrast, large leaves reach temperatures that
   are stressfully high (which slows embryonic development) and provide
   less nitrogen for larvae. Thus, we would expect females to oviposit on
   small leaves. To examine whether leaf size influences female preference
   and offspring performance, we used laboratory and field studies to
   address the following questions. (1) On what size leaves do females
   typically oviposit? (2) Does the distribution of eggs in nature differ
   from that expected by chance? And (3) how does leaf size affect survival
   or growth of eggs and larvae? We find that oviposition choices of
   females do not lead to the highest probability of offspring survival.
   Females lay eggs on larger leaves, likely due to the greater
   accessibility of those leaves; however, eggs are more likely to hatch on
   small leaves. Larvae grow faster on large leaves, but larvae are also
   surprisingly mobile, suggesting that the consequences of oviposition
   site are minor once eggs have hatched. Larval mobility was seen only in
   the field, not in the laboratory, emphasizing the importance of field
   studies for predicting real-world performance. Although females' leaf
   choices are potentially risky for eggs, the threats of high temperature
   and predation may vary sufficiently in space and time that there is no
   consistent selection for strong preferences. Furthermore, the fitness
   consequences for eggs and larvae largely offset each other and offspring
   are sufficiently mobile to cope with the conditions where they are laid.

AB Identifying mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is
   essential in developing a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary
   dynamics in natural populations. Phenotypic plasticity allows for
   phenotypic change in response to changes in the environment, and as such
   may play a major role in adaptation to environmental heterogeneity.
   Here, the plasticity of stress response in Drosophila melanogaster
   originating from two distinct geographic regions and ecological habitats
   was examined. Adults were given a short-term, 5-day exposure to
   combinations of temperature and photoperiod to elicit a plastic response
   for three fundamental aspects of stress tolerance that vary adaptively
   with geography. This was replicated both in the laboratory and in
   outdoor enclosures in the field. In the laboratory, geographic origin
   was the primary determinant of the stress response. Temperature and the
   interaction between temperature and photoperiod also significantly
   affected stress resistance. In the outdoor enclosures, plasticity was
   distinct among traits and between geographic regions. These results
   demonstrate that short-term exposure of adults to ecologically relevant
   environmental cues results in predictable effects on multiple aspects of
   fitness. These patterns of plasticity vary among traits and are highly
   distinct between the two examined geographic regions, consistent with
   patterns of local adaptation to climate and associated environmental
   parameters.

AB Natural plant hybrid zones have been described as 'sinks' and 'centers
   of biodiversity' for herbivores and fungal pathogens. Jasmonic acid is
   known to be a critical signaling molecule for defense against these
   enemies. Does inhibition of jasmonic acid perhaps contribute to the
   susceptibility of hybrid plants to attack by herbivores? Here, we
   discuss recent evidence that plant immune system incompatibilities are
   likely to downregulate jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent responses through
   their effect on expression of the salicylic acid (SA)dependent pathway.
   Because these hybrid immune incompatibilities are a function of
   environmental temperatures, they suggest a dependency between attack
   rates in hybrid zones and environmental conditions. Hybrid zones in
   colder environments, for example at higher elevations or latitudes, are
   more likely to exhibit elevated SA, suppressed jasmonic acid-dependent
   defenses, and lower resistance to herbivores and other necrotrophic
   pathogens.
