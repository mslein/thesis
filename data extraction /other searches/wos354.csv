Yet an overwhelming number of laboratory studies incubate animals under constant thermal conditions that cannot capture natural thermal variability. Here, we systematically searched for studies that incubated eggs of ectothermic vertebrates, including both fishes and herpetofauna, under thermally variable regimes. We ultimately developed a compendium of 66 studies that used thermally variable conditions for egg incubation. In this review, we qualitatively discuss key findings from literature in the compendium, including the phenotypic effects resulting from different patterns of thermally variable incubation, as well as the ontogenetic persistence of these effects. We also describe a physiological framework for contextualizing some of these effects, based on thermal performance theory. Lastly, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of thermally variable incubation and offer suggestions for future studies.",2471-5638,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aug-20,2471-5646,32767534,J,"Hutchings, Jeffrey/ABA-1098-2020",1,WOS:000556175000001,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Thermal Variability During Ectotherm Egg Incubation: a Synthesis and Framework.,selected,NA

We studied the temperature fluctuations in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands, which account for as much as 65% of the total variance. We analyzed data from 25 moorings along the mainland and the Northern Channel Islands deployed at depths 8-18 m during 1999-2012. In the diurnal band, the temperature fluctuations vary almost simultaneously within two distinct regions, with a lag of 5 h between the regions: the mainland east of Point Conception and the west part of the Channel exposed to the large-scale winds. The two regions of in-phase temperature variability are in agreement with a previously published division of zones according to the wind characteristics. The portion of the diurnal temperature variance that is wind driven does not propagate along the coastline, but rather is directly forced by the wind. The semidiurnal temperature oscillations are more substantial in the Northern Channel Islands. These findings are consistent with a numerical study that predicted that the steep slopes of the Santa Cruz Basin, located south of the Channel Islands, are a source of semidiurnal internal tides. We conclude that the contrast between the spatial patterns of the diurnal and semidiurnal temperature oscillations on scales of tens of kilometers reflects the spatial distribution of the main forcing in each band, namely the diurnal wind and the locally generated semidiurnal internal tide.

Analysis of temperature measurements made under a variety of conditions confirms previous results concerning the decrease in the magnitude of the fluctuations with altitude near the ground: the rms magnitude of the temperature fluctuations at an elevation of 70 feet is, on average, 52% of the mean rms value at 9 feet. However, these new measurements made at point locations show a power spectrum close to the Kolmogorov-Taylor prediction at frequencies up to 1.0 Hz, for average wind speeds above 2 m/s. In addition, correlation analysis between sensors located at the same elevation but separated by a given distance shows up to 50% correlation out to separations as large as 24 meters with wind speeds of a few meters per second, and indicate that Taylor's approximation applies over spatial distances in the range of 24-85 meters, or on timescales as large as ten seconds, and perhaps as large as 14 or 15 seconds.

Shrimp were inoculated intramuscularly with a dose of 10,000 SID50 of either virulent WSSV Thai-1 or less virulent WSSV Viet or mock inoculated. Temperature was kept either continuously at 27 degrees C or switched from 27 degrees C to 33 degrees C at 12 h post inoculation (hpi) and maintained at that temperature for 6 h (6 h 33 degrees C), 12 h (12 h 33 degrees C), 18 h (18 h 33 degrees C) or 24 h (24 h 33 degrees C) per day. Temperature was then lowered and maintained at 27 degrees C for the remaining hours of the day. The experiments ran for 132 hpi with WSSV Thai-1 and 168-192 hpi with WSSV Viet. WSSV infections were demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Shrimp kept continuously at 27 degrees C, started to show clinical signs at 24 hpi and mortalities started at 36 hpi with both strains. Cumulative mortalities reached 100% at 60 hpi with WSSV Thai-1 and at 168-192 hpi with WSSV Viet in two experiments. At constant 33 degrees C (24 h 33 degrees C), mortalities were 0% with WSSV Thai-1 and 5% or 10% with WSSV Viet. With exposure to 33 degrees C for 6 or 12 h per day (6 h 33 degrees C or 12 h 33 degrees C), cumulative mortalities reached 90-100% at 72-96 hpi with WSSV Thai-1.

Caused by the unstable turbulent penetration, temperature fluctuations with large amplitude and high frequency can lead to time-varying wall thermal stress and even thermal fatigue on the inner wall. Numerous cases, however, exist where inner wall temperatures cannot be measured and only outer wall temperature measurements are feasible. Therefore, it is one of the popular research areas in nuclear science and engineering to estimate temperature fluctuations on the inner wall from measurements of outer wall temperatures without damaging the structure of the pipe. In this study, both the one-dimensional (1D) and the two-dimensional (2D) inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) were solved to estimate the temperature fluctuations on the inner wall. First, numerical models of both the 1D and the 2D direct heat conduction problem (DHCP) were structured in MATLAB, based on the finite difference method with an implicit scheme. Second, both the 1D IHCP and the 2D IHCP were solved by the steepest descent method (SDM), and the DHCP ""results of temperatures on the outer wall were used to estimate the temperature fluctuations on the inner wall. Third, we compared the temperature fluctuations on the inner wall estimated by the 1D IHCP with those estimated by the 2D IHCP in four cases: (1) when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was 3 degrees C, (2) when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was 30 degrees C, (3) when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was 160 degrees C, and (4) when the fluid temperatures inside the pipe were random from 50 degrees C to 210 degrees C.",1003-2169,NA,26,2,160-165,NA,NA,NA,1993-033X,NA,J,NA,1,WOS:000395723200010,0,1,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,MAR-APR 2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Inverse Heat Conduction Estimation of Inner Wall Temperature Fluctuations under Turbulent Penetration.,excluded,NA

Freshwater turtles have long been used to characterize the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying TSD and provide a great system to investigate how changing climatic conditions will affect vertebrates with TSD. Unfortunately, most of what we know about the mechanisms underlying TSD comes from laboratory conditions that do not accurately mimic natural conditions (i.e., constant incubation temperatures and supraphysiological steroid manipulations). In this paper, we review recent advances in our understanding of how TSD operates in nature that arose from studies using more natural fluctuating incubation temperatures and natural variation in maternal estrogens within the yolk.

New S-forms for the Renyi and Tsallis distribution functions are found which are normalised with corresponding entropies in contrast to the usual Z-forms normalised with partition functions Z. The superstatistics based on the Gibbs distribution of energy fluctuations gives rise to a distribution function of the same structure that the Renyi and Tsallis distributions have. The long-range ""tail"" of the Renyi distribution is the power-law distribution with the exponent -s expressed in terms of the free Renyi parameter q as s = 1/(1 - q).

The parameter q can be uniquely determined with the use of a further extension of MEP as the condition for maximum of the difference between the Renyi and Boltzmann entropies for the same power-law distribution dependent on q.

The data collected during these experiments are processed and discussed in order to evaluate the contribution to the thermal radiation of both long term and fluctuating parts of the temperature field. This study presents pioneering measurements about the heat transfer governing a wildfire spread in the open. Second, this work attempts to evaluate the incidence of fluctuations in thermal data. Using simple statistical assumptions we show that neglecting fluctuations of the thermal source can lead to underestimate the radiant flux density emitted ahead of the fire front and therefore, the related fire hazard.

However, problems may arise as low night temperature (LNT) is known to increase leaf starch contents and delay plant development. In this study it was investigated whether increased CO2 concentrations can decrease the negative effects of LNT, when plants of vegetative Chrysanthemum morifolium 'Coral Charm' are grown under greenhouse conditions. Plants were grown under long day conditions (LD) with a photoperiod of 17 h in four compartments. The four compartments had a day temperature set point of 22 degrees C, and four combinations of night temperatures and CO2 concentration during the day; the night temperature set points were 20 degrees C and 12 degrees C, and set points of CO2 concentrations were, ambient CO2 of 400 mu l l(-1) and high CO2 of 900 mu l l(-1). Plants were harvested after 3, 4 and 7 weeks. The leaf carbohydrate contents of the chrysanthemums differed in relation to harvest time and the photon flux density (PFD) measured outside the greenhouse. Treatments with high CO2 and low night temperature (LNT) increased leaf carbohydrate contents, but the effect was more pronounced at the 7 weeks harvest, where also the PFD was high. Generally, the treatment with high CO2 increased growth in terms of increased shoot dry matter (DM) and the formation of leaves in plants grown at LNT. LNT had the opposite effect decreasing shoot DM production, stem length and leaf number, but only at ambient CO2 concentrations. The results illustrate that when plants are grown in a combination with LNT and high CO2, the accumulation of leaf carbohydrates increases, however plant growth is less limited by the LNT in comparison to plants grown in LNT at ambient CO2 concentrations. It is suggested to include high CO2 concentrations in greenhouse production of Chrysanthemum morifolium, when grown under LNT.",1611-4426,NA,75,3,118-122,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J,"Rosenqvist, Eva/G-9407-2014; Thorup-Kristensen, Kristian/C-6417-2014; Kjaer, Katrine/I-3525-2012; Aaslyng, Jesper Mazanti/",1,WOS:000280438400004,0,1,0,1,0,0,NA,"Rosenqvist, Eva/0000-0001-9288-6248; Thorup-Kristensen, and Kristian/0000-0001-5476-985X; Aaslyng, Jesper and Mazanti/0000-0003-3656-1558",Jun-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Leaf Carbohydrate Contents and Growth of Chrysanthemum Morifolium in Response to Low Night Temperatures and High Co2.,excluded,NA

The in vitro approach consisted of delivering hyperthermia to a fixed-perfused canine kidney phantom using a SURLAS prototype. Both approaches allowed the study of temperature fluctuations for several important clinically relevant parameters: scan time, scan distance, perfusion rate and skin cooling. The simulation results showed that the largest temperature fluctuations were located at the opposite ends of the scan window where the scanning reflector comes to a sudden and complete stop and reverses direction. The smallest fluctuations were located at the centre of the scan window. For a given scan distance, the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations increased linearly with increasing scan time, and increased almost linearly as a function of blood perfusion rate.

Methods: Serum of 43 individuals was randomly assigned to a fluctuation (n=21) and a control group (n=22). Serum of the fluctuation group underwent controlled temperature fluctuations (30 fluctuations <-75 degrees C - <-65 degrees C - <-75 degrees C under real-life freezer conditions within 21 days).

Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying anisotropic compressible turbulence (turbulent Mach number 0.06-0.6) with imposed temperature fluctuations are performed to examine: (i) interactions between solenoidal and dilatational kinetic energy; (ii) partition between dilatational kinetic energy and thermodynamic potential energy; and (iii) redistribution of solenoidal and dilatational kinetic energy among the various Reynolds stress components. It is found that solenoidal kinetic energy levels and return-to-isotropy are weakly dependent on Mach number but independent of imposed temperature fluctuations in the parameter range studied. The dilatational kinetic energy generated is proportional to the square of the pressure fluctuations associated with the initial solenoidal and temperature fluctuations and thus a strong function of Mach number and heat release intensity. The energy exchange between dilatational kinetic and potential energy is driven by a strong proclivity toward equipartition.

The resulting, non-equilibrium dynamics of electrons has only begun to be explored. Experimentally the time-dependence of the electron temperature (deviating from the lattice temperature) has been investigated in small metallic islands. Motivated by these experiments, we investigate theoretically the electronic energy and temperature fluctuations in a metallic island in the Coulomb blockade regime, tunnel coupled to an electronic reservoir, i.e. a single electron box. We show that electronic quantum tunnelling between the island and the reservoir, in the absence of any net charge or energy transport, induces fluctuations of the island electron temperature. The full distribution of the energy transfer as well as the island temperature is derived within the framework of full counting statistics. In particular, the low-frequency temperature fluctuations are analysed, fully accounting for charging effects and non-zero reservoir temperature.

These radiance fluctuations often show wave-like structures with clear phase coherence among different altitudes. This paper applies a spectral analysis to MLS limb-tracking radiances and obtains a seasonal climatology of horizontal wavenumber spectra at scales of 50-800 km for 6 altitudes (38, 43, 48, 53, 61 and 80 km) and 8 latitudes (from 70 degreesS to 70 degreesN). Most of the power spectra exhibit a slope close to -2 but some can be as steep as -3 in wave active regions. The spectral power density is strongly season-and-latitude dependent in the stratosphere, which is thought largely due to the modulation of the background winds on the vertical wavenumber spectrum. The spectral amplitudes grow exponentially with height between 38 and 50 km but the growth rate becomes small or close to zero near and above 50 km. The growth rates at 38-53 km attitudes are scale-dependent showing less efficient vertical propagation for larger-scale waves. The near-zero growth in the lower mesosphere is thought mainly due to wave saturation/breaking at these altitudes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model is based on that of Webster and Thomson (Atmos Environ 36:5031-5042, 2002) in that it is a coupling of a classical plume model in a crossflow with stochastic differential equations for the vertical velocity and temperature (which are themselves coupled). The novelty lies in the addition of the latter stochastic differential equation. Parametrizations of the plume turbulence are presented that are used as inputs to the model. The root-mean-square temperature is assumed to be proportional to the difference between the centreline temperature of the plume and the ambient temperature. The constant of proportionality is tuned by comparison with equivalent statistics from large-eddy simulations (LES) of buoyant plumes in a uniform crossflow and linear stratification. We compare plume trajectories for a wide range of crossflow velocities and find that the model generally compares well with the equivalent LES results particularly when added mass is included in the model. The exception occurs when the crossflow velocity component becomes very small. Comparison of the scalar concentration, both in terms of the height of the maximum concentration and its vertical spread, shows similar behaviour.

One is L-2 from directed horizontal visibility graph and the other is L-1 from consecutive increasing and decreasing steps. The results show that there are differential TA features among daily temperature fluctuations. Firstly, there are marked differences in TA strengths among different temperature variables. It is found that dominated uniformly significant TA (larger than the threshold from corresponding surrogates) emerges in almost all observed T-mean fluctuations. However, this kind of uniformly significant TA can't be found in T-max, T-min and DTR for both observed and reanalysis data sets. Since both TA measures L-1 and L-2 quantify the temporal structures in the given series, this distinguishable TA strengths found in different temperature variables indicates that there are distinct temporal structures in the different temperature variables' variations. Secondly, the TA in each temperature variable is region dependent. The TA strength for each temperature variable is spatially non-uniform with some strong and weak TA regional patterns and these strong and weak TA regional patterns may depend on local weather or climate conditions. Moreover, comparison studies of the same temperature variable reveal that time irreversible features are distinguishable between observations and reanalysis, and this differential feature can be taken as an index to evaluate the quality of reanalysis.",0930-7575,NA,53,2-Jan,585-600,NA,NA,NA,1432-0894,NA,J,NA,4,WOS:000471722400035,0,4,0,1,0,0,NA,"Fu, Zuntao/0000-0001-9256-8514",Jul-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Differential Temporal Asymmetry among Different Temperature Variables' Daily Fluctuations.,selected,NA

Accurate volume change measurement does not depend solely on the resolution of the measurement devices used but also on other factors such as the measurement method, cell pressure, temperature fluctuations, system creep, and system compliance. This paper examines volume change measurement inferred from the volume of the confining water in a triaxial cell.

Our approach exploits the fact that the quantities (species concentrations, temperature) comprising the state of the combustion chamber gases are not independent, but often correlate sharply. Information about spatial temperature variations is obtained indirectly by observing two complementary quantities that sensitively reflect the local temperature. Spatial formaldehyde (H2CO) concentration variations in the endgas are converted to temperature fluctuations using calculated correlations between temperature and [H2CO]. Additionally, the geometrical size of inhomogeneities is deduced from LIF-images displaying the locally varying formation of temperature-sensitive intermediate species. The results indicate that temperature fluctuations exceeding 20 K are present in the nominally homogeneous endgas.

Storage regimes were selected and designed to mimic either good or poor practice likely to be experienced in the cold chain (+/- 0.1 degrees C, +/- 1 degrees C, +/- 3 degrees C or +/- 5 degrees C). Quality changes and dough weight loss were measured for both constant and fluctuating frozen storage conditions. Quality was assessed as CO2 production rate, yeast viability, bread specific volume and bread crumb firmness relative to fresh dough. Both the freezing process and subsequent frozen storage had a significant effect on all quality parameters. Dough weight loss and bread crumb firmness increased with increasing storage time. CO2 production rate reduced with increased storage period, however, constant storage conditions (-18 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and good temperature control (-18 +/- 1 degrees C) gave no significant difference in CO2 production rate for up to 112 days after freezing. Large temperature fluctuations during frozen storage (-18 +/- 5 degrees C) and storage at higher temperatures (a combination of -18 degrees C, -13 degrees C and -8 degrees C) resulted in significantly more rapid loss of dough and bread quality than storage at constant and/or colder temperatures.

Comparison of several alternatives for capturing the influence of temperature fluctuations on survey responses (some drawn from the literature, some newly constructed) shows a temporary increase in support for government assistance for adaptation after the onset of a warm spell, but a longer exposure to extreme temperatures does not necessarily lead to more support for adaptation policies.

Objectives were to determine the effects of rapid cooling on thermal response and future reproductive success in pigs. Thirty-six replacement gifts (137.8 +/- 0.9 kg BW) were estrus synchronized and then 14.1 +/- 0.4 d after estrus confirmation, pigs were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (TN; n=12; 19.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C) for 6 h, or HS (36.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for 3 h, followed by 3 h of rapid cooling (HSRC; n=12; immediate TN exposure and water dousing) or gradual cooling (HSGC; n=12; gradual decrease to TN conditions) repeated over 2 d. Vaginal (T-V) and gastrointestinal tract temperatures (T-GI) were obtained every 15 min, and blood was collected on d 1 and d 2 during the HS and recovery periods at 180 and 60 min, respectively. Pigs were bred 8.3 +/- 0.8 d after thermal treatments over 2 d. Reproductive tracts were collected and total fetus number and viability were recorded 28.0 +/- 0.8 d after insemination. HS increased T-V and T-GI (P=0.01; 0.98 degrees C) in HSRC and HSGC compared to TN pigs. During recovery, T-V was reduced from 15 to 105 min (P=0.01; 033 degrees C) in HSRC compared to HSGC pigs, but no overall differences in T-GI were detected (P<0.05; 39.67 degrees C).

Experiments were conducted on recently matured seeds at 22 degrees C mean temperature with fluctuation amplitudes of 0 degrees-16 degrees C, and at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean temperature) in light and darkness before and after a cold-wet stratification. At 22 degrees C mean temperature, seed germination increased in almost all investigated species with increasing temperature amplitudes, in both light and darkness. The average germination percentage across all species was 29.4% in light and 5.1% in darkness. The averaged amplitude required to reach 50% of maximum germination was 9.8 degrees C. Species with little sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in light showed a clear sensitivity in darkness. The germination percentage was 4.0% for species with seed weights >0.9 mg and 23% for species with seed weights <0.9 mg. By means of a principal component analysis the investigated species could be divided into three groups: (1) species with considerable germination at constant temperature, (2) species with a high germination percentage in response to strong fluctuations but no germination at the constant temperature and at low amplitudes and (3) species which did not germinate at all or showed a low degree of germination at high amplitudes in light. The germination percentage of recently matured seeds was generally lower at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean) than at 28/16 degrees C (22 degrees C mean). Cold-wet stratification enhanced germination at 22/10 degrees C in 33 species in light, and in 26 species strict dark dormancy was relieved. Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, a need for relatively high temperature fluctuations to trigger germination and reach 50% of maximum germination and prolonged lag-phases of non-stratified seeds were common features of almost all investigated sedges and might favour the built-up of persistent seed banks. The capacity to respond to fluctuating temperatures in particular provides a mechanism favouring spring germination. Sedges occurring in dry or mesic habitats showed a lower sensitivity to alternating temperatures than sedges of wet habitats. In contrast to forest species of other taxa, forest sedges were highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, thereby restricting their germination to vegetation gaps. The variation in response to fluctuating temperatures and stratification in general were relatively small in the investigated Carer species, thus suggesting that their germination behaviour was determined not only by habitat conditions.",0367-2530,NA,194,1,21-32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J,NA,23,WOS:000078418100003,0,24,0,20,0,0,NA,NA,Jan-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Germination Responses of Temperate Carex-Species to Diurnally Fluctuating Temperatures - a Comparative Study.,selected,NA

The three systems were (i) an emulsion based on anhydrous milk fat (AMF) consisting of crystals dispersed in liquid oil, (ii) butter which is a water in oil emulsion consisting of a continuous crystal network with partially disrupted fat globules interrupted by intact fat globules and water droplets, and (iii) freeze-dried cream which is an oil in water emulsion consisting of concentrated milk fat globules. The microstructure of the systems was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and linked to their material properties by large and small deformation rheology techniques. Different rheological techniques were used to characterize the material descriptors. The crystallization behavior was studied by thermal analysis and pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. The freeze-dried cream was characterized as the softest, more elastic, and less stiff when compared to butter and AMF.

Only after several temperature fluctuations, material consolidation was observed in AMF, whereas no significant changes in material properties were observed in the freeze-dried cream.

Temperature fluctuations ranged from -24 degrees C to -18 degrees C and from -18 degrees C to -6 degrees C. The number of fluctuacions ranged from 0 (that is to say, only freezing and thawing processes) to 32 at each above fluctuation range, simulating practical frozen storage conditions. Compression, shear and tension tests were carried out to measure the extent of structural damage caused to the potato tissue. Plots of log (rheological parameters and moisture content) versus number of temperature fluctuations showed two distinct regions; the first was a rectilinear plot with a steep negative slope up to four fluctuations. The second was also a rectilinear plot with a shallow negative slope beyond four fluctuations. For higher number of fluctuations, most of rheological parameters reached a value almost constant. These two-stage softening rate curves are consistent with the biphasic model and qualitatively similar to those for thermal softening of the vegetables. This study shows that two substrates S-a and S-b may be involved in providing firmness to potato tissue in freezing and frozen storage conditions.

The optimal water temperature for embryonic development of this population is 21 degrees C However, in some cases, the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.

The results showed that anammox activity initially decreased in the three reactors, but that activity levels and nitrogen loading rate (NLR) increased as the bacteria gradually adapted to the new conditions (12-30 days). Temperature and concentration shift affected anammox activity jointly. In the process, the abundance of mRNA of the key functional genes of hdh and nirS, changed with time but this change did not reflect the change of anammox activity. When the reactors reached a stable state after 40 d, the effect of temperature fluctuations was tested. The results showed that anammox adapted to low temperatures as soon as temperature decreased (i.e., decreased from 35 degrees C to 15 degrees C). When temperature increased, 2-3 days were needed for activity recovery. From this result, it may be concluded that reactors with low temperatures and low substrate (mainstream) concentrations can be started up using anammox cultivated at a higher temperature (35 degrees C) with low substrate. Then anammox in Ra was used to start up a mainstream reactor at 15 degrees C and it was operated for 60 days. The results showed that the activity in Ra decreased sharply to the level as that of Rc at the stable state. After the experiment, microbiological analysis showed that the anammox was stable and that Candidatus Kuenenia was the dominant species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The accuracy and reliability of body temperature assessment may significantly affect the proper treatment. Aim: To compare the conventional and continuous body temperature recordings in hospitalized patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at a tertiary care centre and study included 55 patients aged between 18-65 years with a history of fever admitted to a tertiary care hospital. A noninvasive continuous temperature recording was done using TherCom (R) device through tympanic temperature probe at tympanic site at one-minute intervals for 24 hours. The conventional temperatures were recorded in the axilla using mercury thermometer at specific time intervals at 12:00 noon, 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM. Peak temperature differences between continuous and conventional methods were compared by applying Independent sample t-test. Intra class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) test was performed to assess the reliability between two temperature-monitoring methods. A p<0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The average peak temperature by non-invasive continuous recording method was 39.07 degrees C +/- 0.76 degrees C while it was 37.55 degrees C +/- 0.62 degrees C by the conventional method. A significant temperature difference of 1.52 degrees C [p<0.001; 95% CI(1.26-1.78)] was observed between continuous and conventional temperature methods. Intra class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between continuous and conventional temperature readings at 12:00 noon was alpha= 0.540, which had moderate reliability.

The temperatures obtained from the solution of the direct heat conduction problem (DHCP) using the finite element method (FEM) were pseudo-experimental input data on the outer wall for the IHCP. Comparisons of the estimated fluid temperatures with experimental fluid temperatures near the inner wall showed that the IHCP could accurately capture the actual temperature in form of the frequency of the temperature fluctuations.

To find out the oscillating mechanism of the cooling temperature and improve the temperature stability of cooler, the inner temperature of the cold head has to be measured. However, it is difficult to measure the inner oscillating temperature of the cold head directly because the invasive temperature detectors may disturb the oscillating flow. Fortunately, the outer surface temperature of the cold head can be measured accurately by invasive temperature measurement techniques. In this paper, a mathematical model of inverse heat conduction problem is presented to identify the inner surface oscillating temperature of cold head according to the measured temperature of the outer surface in a GM cryocooler. Inverse heat conduction problem will be solved using control volume approach.

Because so many critical parameters scale with body mass, long-term temperature fluctuations can have dramatic impacts. We examined the response of a small mammalian herbivore, the bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea), to temperature change from 20,000 yr B.P. to present, at five sites within the Colorado Plateau. Our investigations focused on the relationship between temperature, plant composition and abundance, and woodrat size. Body size was estimated by measuring fossil fecal pellets, a technique validated in earlier work. We found significant and highly covariable patterns in body mass over the five locations, suggesting that responses to temperature fluctuations during the late Quaternary have been very similar. Although woodrat mass and the occurrence of several plant species in the fossil record were significantly correlated, in virtually all instances changes in woodrat size preceded changes in vegetational composition. These results may be due to the greater sensitivity of woodrats to temperature, or to the shorter generation times of woodrats as compared to most plants. An alternative hypothesis is that winter temperatures increased before summer ones. Woodrats are highly sensitive to warmer winters, whereas little response would be expected from forest/woodland plants growing at their lower limits. Our work suggests that woodrat size is a precise paleothermometer, yielding information about temperature variation over relatively short-term temporal and regional scales.

When eggs of ectotherms are exposed to large temperature fluctuations, egg phenotypes and post-hatching traits may be altered, but little relevant information is available on insects. Hence, we simulated a set of natural diurnal temperature fluctuations each with the same mean temperature (25 +/- 0, 25 +/- 2, 25 +/- 4, 25 +/- 6, 25 +/- 8, 25 +/- 10 degrees C), to which we exposed the eggs of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and assessed subsequent egg development, survival and post-hatching traits. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in these phenomena between the constant temperature treatment and the treatments with moderate temperature fluctuations. However, large temperature fluctuations slowed development and lowered hatching rate during the egg stage. In addition the effects of these large temperature fluctuations extended to the larval stage, but not to the pupal and adult stages. No apparent costs of compensatory responses, which occurred in the larval stage, were detected in the later stages. These findings indicate that fluctuating temperature effects are potentially important in predicting insect phenology and population dynamics. As an independent factor, the effects of temperature fluctuations on a stage in the life history must be factored into models for predicting insect development that are based on mean temperatures.

In this paper their unsteady response to temperature fluctuations is investigated. To this end, a simple one dimensional duct is considered as an analytic surrogate model of a reheat combustion chamber. A chemistry-based correlation for the autoignition delay time is used to predict the flame position. In order to analyze the flame response to temperature fluctuations, the inlet boundary condition is harmonically excited. Depending on the amplitude and frequency of excitation, nonlinear phenomena are observed, in particular the co-existence of multiple flame fronts at different axial locations. The analytic formulation of the problem allows us to predict the onset of nonlinearities and to evaluate maps separating the linear from the nonlinear behavior, as function of the system parameters. Amplitude and frequency thresholds triggering different nonlinear properties of the system are identified. Verification of the obtained results for different excitation states is made by comparison to previously conducted Large Eddy Simulations of a simplified reheat combustor geometry represented by a backward-facing step. The simplified model is able to correctly predict the appearance of nonlinear phenomena as observed in the simulations suggesting that the governing factors are well represented.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are commonly used in vaccine research where comparable and reliable results between different research institutions and laboratories are of high importance. Whereas freezing and thawing processes are well studied, controlled, and standardized, storage conditions are often disregarded. To close this gap, we investigated the influence of suboptimal storage conditions during low-temperature storage on PBMC viability, recovery, and T cell functionality. For this purpose, PBMCs were isolated and exposed with help of a robotic system in a low-temperature environment from 0 up to 350 temperature fluctuation cycles in steps of 50 cycles to simulate storage conditions in large biorepositories with sample storage, removal, and sorting functions. After the simulation, the viability, recovery, and T cell functionality were analyzed to determine the number of temperature rises, which ultimately lead to significant cell damage. All studied parameters decreased with increasing number of temperature cycles. Sometimes after as little as only 50 temperature cycles, a significant effect was observed. These results are very important for all fields in which cell cryopreservation is employed, particularly for clinical and multicenter studies wherein the comparability and reproducibility of results play a crucial role.

Information on the state of turbulence is usually derived from the frequency behaviour of temperature fluctuations. Until now. temperature fluctuations were mostly detected by thermocouples. which are protected from the chemically aggressive melt by silica quartz tubes. The major disadvantage of this technique is the damping effect on amplitudes of temperature fluctuations at frequencies higher than 0.5 Hz. This drew back significantly the information available on the state of turbulence. A method to overcome this disadvantage is an optical technique of measuring temperatures that provides sampling rates up to 100 Hz. In this contribution, we present optical temperature measurements using silica rods as waveguides in large-diameter Czochralski silicon melts. The detected temperature fluctuations give slopes of power spectra that are approximately proportional to f(-4) for higher frequencies, in the case of the smaller crucible of 14 inch diameter. This indicates a soft turbulence state where melt flow is stabilised by rotational forces. On the other hand, a hard turbulence state of melt now, indicated by an f(-5.3) behaviour of the power spectra, was found for the large crucible with 32 inch diameter. In contrast to the smaller crucible, we found no changes of the state of turbulence by increasing the crucible rotation rate. The results are discussed with respect to its consequences on the properties of silicon crystals grown by the Czochralski method from large-scale melts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

This analysis is concerned With acoustic coupling experienced in high frequency instabilities. Experiments carried out on a Multiple injector combustor (MIC) operating Willi liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are used to simulate oil a model scale the situation prevailing in a liquid rocket thrust chamber. External acoustic modulations are generated by periodically blocking an auxiliary nozzle Willi a rotating toothed wheel. By continuously changing the rotation velocity, it is possible to apply a linear frequency sweep and obtain the response of the system to all external excitation. It is found that the chamber quality factor under hot fire conditions is reduced with respect to the one measured under cold flow conditions. This is shown to be correlated With the level and spatial extension of temperature fluctuations inside the chamber. Temperature fluctuations induce variations in the speed of sound Which in turn Perturb the eigenfrequencies of the system and modify its response. This effect is modeled in a simplified way by considering a second order dynamical system featuring an eigenfrequency which fluctuates around its mean value. The dynamics is analyzed by making use of simulations and by the method of averaging. It is shown that when the eigenfrequency fluctuates, the system behaves as if it had an augmented level of dissipation and that this induces a reduction in the quality factor. It is concluded that this mechanism could have an important impact on the development of oscillations in liquid rocket engines. (C) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sanford_2002_JOOFEXMABIANEC,"Sanford, E","The feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators (Pisaster ochraceus and Nucella canaliculata) under water temperatures simulating episodic upwelling",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,10.1016/S0022-0981(02)00164-8,2002,"Although most upwelling regions are marked by strong fluctuations in water temperature, few studies have examined how episodic cold-water events affect the physiology and ecology of benthic marine invertebrates. I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 degreesC, a constant 12 degreesC, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 degreesC. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 degreesC consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 degreesC individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 degreesC tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 degreesC. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 degreesC had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 degreesC tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 degreesC, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species.

Some inferences were made about the variation of these indices of vegetation and temperature, associated with climatic changes, in periods seasonal and in years of climatic contrasts under the influence of El Ninos, La Ninas and Pacific Normal Conditions. The output data of the compilations of the Fortran routines were made available in graphs and generated by the GridS (Grid Analysis and Display System) software. The results showed a strong positive correlation between NDVI indices associated with IVC and TCI in the NEB semi-arid region. This result is due to the low percentages of precipitation that this region possesses, being thus more evident the strong relation with these indices of vegetation and temperature in the NEB semi-arid. As for other areas of the NEB region that have the highest precipitation index, the relationship between NDVI and precipitation was not as evident in this study.

A challenge when conducting such assessments is the integration of the multi-level properties and processes of ecosystems into an assessment framework. Focusing on the primary stresses of climate thermal variability (at both upper and lower extremes), this study proposes a quantitative indicator system following the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment that assesses the impact of historical climate change, during 1901-2013, on the natural terrestrial vegetation types in China. The final output of the vulnerability assessment was expressed as a composite index, composed of ecosystem exposure, sensitivity and resilience to climate thermal change, and including biological, ecological and spatial traits of vegetation types in the assessment. The exposure to temperature variability was generally higher in January than in July, and higher in non-arborous vegetation types than forests. In contrast, sensitivity was higher for forests, wetlands and alpine tundra regions, especially for small areas and areas with scattered patterns. Original forests especially those distributed in the north had lower resilience than other vegetation types. The vulnerability of natural vegetation types in China to the temperature variability of the past century was very low to moderate, with a few exceptions, including tropical mangroves and the semiarid to arid vegetation types in northwestern China, which had high vulnerability. Vulnerability was stronger in winter than in summer. Our results are generally in accord with the scenario-based projections on the geographical pattern of vegetation vulnerability to climate change, and revealed the difference caused by not considering moisture. The risks for these fragmented and narrow-range ecosystems are highlighted, and the importance of natural resilience is stressed for the assessment of vegetation vulnerability to climate change. Given the inadequate coverage of the natural reserve network in China (after the large investment in recent decades) found in the high-vulnerability vegetation types (with a few exceptions), the assessment of natural resilience of ecosystems could be critical for the optimal design of socio-economic strategies in response to the impacts of future climate change.

Woodlice (the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis) exhibit a readily observed behaviour that may reflect their acclimation capacities. When they find themselves on their back, they sometimes roll over (i.e. right themselves). Whether they do, and how fast they do it, are measures of their behaviour and performance that vary with ambient temperature. Goal: Measure experimentally the effect of acclimation to environmental thermal variability on the rollover behaviour of Porcellio laevis. Methods: Maintain woodlice in 24 degrees C laboratory environments. Each individual lived in one of three thermal treatments: constant temperature regime (delta = 0); a regime with alternating temperatures of 27 degrees C during daytime and 21 degrees C at night (delta = 3); and a regime with alternating temperatures of 32 degrees C during daytime and 16 degrees C at night (delta = 8). After 3 months, measure the rollover behaviour (percentage that rolled over) and rollover speed of the woodlice at 5, 15, 25, 32, and 38 degrees C. Rollover speed is the inverse of the time it took an individual to right itself. Results: At 5 and 38 degrees C, most woodlice seemed to be in thermal coma and had very slow rollover speed. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, rollover speed was in the range 0.12-0.18 rollovers per second. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, 52% of individuals righted themselves in similar to 4 s. At these temperatures, most individuals either rolled quickly or remained inactive for the entire 10-min test period. When we examined rollover speed in the cooler (night) and warmer (daytime) periods, individuals subjected to the three regimes of temperature variation differed: woodlice acclimated to delta = 8 roll over very fast when temperature (T) is low and very slowly when T is high; woodlice acclimated to delta = 3 roll over fairly fast when T is low and somewhat slowly when T is high; and woodlice acclimated to delta = 0 roll over quite quickly when T is low and quite slowly when T is high. However, the higher and lower speeds at different regimes neutralized each other so that average rollover speed over the course of a whole day did not depend on the size of the daily fluctuation. Conclusions: The impact of temperature variability must be taken into consideration.

Extending a hypothesis first advanced by Forsythe (1993, in: Recent Advances in Fisheries Biology (T. Okutani, R. K. O'Dor, & T. Kubdera, eds.), Tokyo, Tokai University Press), we formulate a simple individual-level model which incorporates a two-stage growth response for squid hatchlings exposed to continuous seasonal fluctuations of temperature. We show that in seasonally fluctuating temperatures such a growth 'duality' can directly affect the size distribution of squid over the year and we demonstrate how in seasonally warming waters this mechanism may lead to younger individuals surpassing the size of older individuals.

LBFs inhabit a broad range of shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species, to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration, mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site. In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A. lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A. lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra- and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.",0722-4028,NA,37,3,811-824,NA,NA,NA,1432-0975,NA,J,"Kucera, Michal/B-9277-2009; Stuhr, Marleen/T-9771-2019; Rahnenfuhrer, Jorg/; Meyer, Achim/; Rieder, Vera/",4,WOS:000441845500021,0,4,0,3,0,0,NA,"Kucera, Michal/0000-0002-7817-9018; Rahnenfuhrer, and Jorg/0000-0002-8947-440X; Meyer, Achim/0000-0002-4345-274X; Rieder, and Vera/0000-0002-8706-1492",Sep-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Variable Thermal Stress Tolerance of the Reef-Associated Symbiont-Bearing Foraminifera Amphistegina Linked to Differences in Symbiont Type.,selected,NA

Measurements were carried out for test cutting of a 3-mm mild-steel plate with several values of cutting speed and pressure of assist gas (oxygen), using an 1800-watt Ytterbium fiber laser. It is shown that fluctuations of temperature are related to local melt's surface deformations due to unequal radiation absorption; thus the noise spectrum of temperature fluctuations reflects turbulent surface deformation caused by gas jet and capillary waves. The maximum density of turbulent energy dissipation epsilon depends on cutting conditions: its value rises with increasing cutting velocity and oxygen pressure in a described range of parameters. The maximum of epsilon is localized near depth of (1.2 ... 1.5) mm along the cutting front. We can distinguish the specific radiation pulsation spectrum of laser cutting from other processes of radiation affection to the sample, including unwanted degrading of the quality of technological operations. The spectrum of capillary waves on the melt's surface is formed under the effect of assisted gas jet and has a function of omega(-3), omega is cycle frequency.

The present work represents a theoretical analysis of the heated slab that is being cooled with turbulent flow from both sides. Results of the direct numerical simulations predict penetration of the turbulent temperature fluctuations into the solid wall. For a sufficiently thick slab, temperature fluctuations from both sides of the slab do not interfere. As the slab gets thinner, fluctuations from both sides interfere and tend to a finite value as the slab thickness limits toward zero. Due to the non-coherent turbulent flows on each side of the slab, thermal fluctuations in the zero-thickness slab are actually lower than in the case of the zero-thickness wall, which is heated by the same turbulent flow from a single side and is isolated on the other side. Spectral numerical scheme was used for Direct Numerical Simulation of fully developed channel flow that is cooling the idealized slab heated with constant volumetric heat source. Implemented boundary conditions for liquid and solid energy equations correspond to the geometry that can be found in some experimental nuclear reactors with fuel in the form of parallel slabs. Periodicity of streamwise and spanwise directions was assumed for velocity and passive scalar temperature field. For temperature, periodicity of the computational domain was assumed also in the wall-normal direction.

Based on passive remote microwave monitoring, this system has been designed and constructed for brain intracranial applications. During the past years, it has been extensively tested both theoretically and experimentally and results have shown that it seems capable to measure changes of temperature and/or conductivity in phantoms and subcutaneous tissues. The objective of the present research is twofold: on one hand to theoretically study new configurations of the system by changing the ellipsoidal reflector setup and dielectric filling material; on the other, to experimentally examine the system performance using a new, volume reduced cavity that has been constructed based on previous theoretical results. More specifically, new simulations retaining only one half of the ellipsoidal conductive wall cavity filled with dielectric matching materials were carried out, with the view to potentially improve the system's focusing attributes and result in the construction of a more portable version of the existing system. In parallel, experiments with phantoms using a new, modified ellipsoidal cavity are carried out to identify its focusing properties and to verify previous theoretical studies.

The cause of this intermittency is not well understood. We studied the effects of the barotropic tide, vertical stratification, propagation of coastal-trapped waves, regional wind relaxations, and diurnal-band winds on the intermittency of the temperature fluctuations during 1992-2015. We used temperature data from 43 moorings in 10-200 m water depth and wind data from two buoys and one land station. Subtidal-frequency changes in vertical stratification explain 20-40% of the intermittency in diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations at time scales of days to weeks. Along the mainland north of Point Conception and at the Northern Channel Islands, the relaxation of upwelling-favorable winds substantially increases vertical stratification, accounting for up to 55% of the subtidal-frequency variability in stratification. As a result of the enhanced stratification, wind relaxations enhance the diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations at those sites, even though the diurnal-band wind forcing decreases during wind relaxation. A linear model where the background stratification is advected vertically explains a substantial fraction of the temperature fluctuations at most sites. The increase of vertical stratification and subsequent increase in diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations during wind relaxation is a mechanism that can supply nutrients to the euphotic zone and kelp forests in the Channel in summer when upwelling is weak.",2169-9275,NA,122,10,7958-7977,NA,NA,NA,2169-9291,NA,J,"Fewings, Melanie/F-6838-2013",6,WOS:000415893300011,0,6,0,2,0,0,NA,"Fewings, Melanie/0000-0003-2903-1620",Oct-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Effects of the Relaxation of Upwelling-Favorable Winds on the Diurnal and Semidiurnal Water Temperature Fluctuations in the Santa Barbara Channel, California.",selected,NA

To quantify this correlation, a silicon floating-zone experiment was performed on the TEXUS36 flight (February 7, 1998) in the monoellipsoid mirror furnace TEM02-ELLI. During the experiment, temperature fluctuations in the silicon melt zone and the microscopic growth rate were simultaneously measured. Temperature fluctuations of 0.5 degrees C - 0.7 degrees C with main frequencies between 0.1Hz and 0.3Hz were detectable. The microscopic growth rate fluctuated considerably around the average growth rate of 1mm/min: rates from 4mm/min to negative values (backmelting) were observed. Dopant striations are clearly visible in the Sb-doped crystal. The frequencies associated with the dopant inhomogeneities correspond quite well with those of the temperature fluctuations and microscopic growth rates. 3D numerical simulations were performed to predict the optimum position of the temperature sensor, to evaluate characteristic temperature amplitudes and frequencies, and to give insight into the instability mechanisms of Marangoni convection in this configuration. The simulations were in good agreement with the experimental values, showing temperature fluctuations with frequencies f less than or equal to 0.25Hz and amplitudes up to 1.8 degrees C at a position equivalent to that of the sensor tip in the experiment.",0379-6566,14TH ESA SYMPOSIUM ON EUROPEAN ROCKET AND BALLOON PROGRAMMES AND RELATED,437,NA,529-534-European Space Agency; German Aerosp Ctr,"MAY 31-JUN 03, 1999",NA,NA,NA,NA,S,"Croell, Arne/A-2480-2013",0,WOS:000084659100083,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Croell, Arne/0000-0002-8673-9994",1999,NA,"KaldeichSchurmann, B",92-9092-748-8,"POTSDAM, GERMANY",14th ESA Symposium on European Rocket and Balloon Programmes and Related and Research,NA,ESA SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Measurement of Temperature Fluctuations and Microscopic Growth Rates in a Silicon Floating Zone on Texus36.,excluded,NA

Temperature fluctuations with large amplitude and high frequency caused by the unstable thermal stratification can lead to time-varying thermal stress and even induce thermal fatigue of T junction pipes. Monitoring of wall temperature fluctuations of T-junction pipes at nuclear plants has received considerable interest because the thermal fatigue failure of these pipes could present severe environmental implications and large economic losses. In this study, mock-up tests and analyses were conducted to develop a monitoring program for monitoring the wall temperature fluctuations of mixing T-junction pipes. Using a test loop, we simulated the mixing flow of hot and cold fluids in a horizontal T-junction pipe at a nuclear plant. To monitor the wall temperature fluctuations of the horizontal T-junction pipe, we developed a program in MATLAB. The monitoring program could filter out unwanted noise from raw measured temperature data by the singular spectrum analysis and guarantee a grid-independent and time-step-independent solution.

As an important component of surface bioreceptivity, spatiotemporal variation in stone surface temperature plays a critical role in the spatial distribution of saxicolous lichen on historic stone structures, especially within seasonally hot environments. The ornate limestone and tufa stairwell of the Monastery of Cartuja (1516), Granada, Spain, exhibits significant aspect-related differences in lichen distribution. Lichen coverage and diurnal fluctuations in stone surface temperature on the stairwell were monitored and mapped, under anticyclonic conditions in summer and winter, using an infrared thermometer and Geographical Information Systems approach. This research suggests that it is not extreme high surface temperatures that determine the presence or absence of lichen coverage on stonework. Instead, average stone surface temperatures over the course of the year seem to play a critical role in determining whether or not surfaces are receptive to lichen colonization and subsequent biomodification. It is inferred that lichen, capable of surviving extreme surface temperatures during the Mediterranean summer in an ametabolic state, require a respite period of lower temperatures within which they can metabolize, grow and reproduce. The higher the average annual temperature a surface experiences, the shorter the respite period for any lichen potentially inhabiting that surface. A critical average temperature threshold of approximately 21 degrees C has been identified on the stairwell, with average stone surface temperatures greater than this generally inhibiting lichen colonization. A brief visual condition assessment between lichen-covered and lichen-free surfaces on the limestone sections of the stairwell suggests relative bioprotection induced by lichen coverage, with stonework quality and sharpness remaining more defined beneath lichen-covered surfaces. The methodology employed in this paper may have further applications in the monitoring and mapping of thermal stress fatigue on historic building materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Because of its importance to many cooling procedures, investigations on basic mechanisms of jet impingement boiling heat transfer are needed. Until now, most of the experimental studies, carried out under steady-state conditions, used a heat flux controlled system and were limited by the critical heat flux (CHF). The present study focuses on steady-state experiments along the entire boiling curve for hot plate temperatures of up to 700degreesC. A test section has been built up simulating a hot plate. It is divided into 8 independently heated modules of 10 mm length to enable local heat transfer measurements. By means of temperature controlled systems for each module local steady-state experiments in the whole range between single phase heat transfer and film boiling are possible. By solving the two dimensional inverse heat conduction problem, the local heat flux and the corresponding wall temperature on the surface of each module can be computed. The measurements show important differences between boiling curves measured at the stagnation line and those obtained in the parallel flow region. At the stagnation line, the transition boiling regime is characterised by very high heat fluxes, extended to large wall superheats. Inversely, boiling curves in the parallel flow region are very near to classical ones obtained for forced convection boiling.

(V) over dot o(2) was temperature-independent, with temperature quotients (Q(10)) values <= 1 in all populations, indicative of metabolic compensation. We detected no variation in (V) over dot o(2) or survival between populations. To explore the time course of metabolic compensation, we performed an acute acclimation experiment in which (V) over dot o(2) was measured at 20 degrees C, following immediate exposure to 25 degrees C, and following 2 h, 4 h and 6 h exposure to 25 degrees C. This acute acclimation experiment revealed that (V) over dot o(2) increased immediately in SD and FCN, but was no longer different than 20 degrees C levels by 2 h and 4 h at 25 degrees C, respectively. BOB showed no significant change in (V) over dot o(2), which may indicate complete temperature-independent metabolism or different mechanisms of compensation between populations. This study demonstrates a time course of rapid metabolic compensation in response to temperature that occurs in a small intertidal animal, and suggests intertidal invertebrates can thermally acclimate within a few hours of a significant temperature change.",1095-6433,COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE,230,NA,131-137,NA,NA,NA,1531-4332,30690151,J,NA,3,WOS:000459838400016,0,3,0,3,0,0,NA,NA,Apr-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rapid Metabolic Compensation in Response to Temperature Change in the Intertidal Copepod, Tigriopus Californicus.",selected,NA

The present study assesses variability in air temperature, through the analysis of the temperature data set, between 1961-2010 for 7 weather stations located outside the Carpathians: Botosani, Suceava, Iasi, Roman, Bacau, Galati, Buzau, taken from the European Climate Assistant and Datasets and ROCADA databases. The altitudinal amplitude of 254 m (Gala.i 71 m and Suceava 325 m) results in an annual mean difference of 1.5 degrees C, the latitudinal amplitude (2 degrees 20 ') results in a significant change in temperature, horizontally (nearly 2 degrees C, taking into account the fact that, for the northern hemisphere, the temperature varies with 0.86 degrees C/1 degrees latitude). The use of the Gorczynski continentality index, removes the temperature differences set by latitude, the altitude influence being insignificant in the context of the atmospheric boundary layer circulation. For extra-Carpathian Moldavia, the temperature evolution trend is rising for mean, minimum, maximum, and also related phenomena (periods of drought, hail, tropical nights, days of summer). Thermal variability, as measured by statistic indices associated with extreme values, temperature anomalies and amplitudes has values higher in the cold season than in the warm one. Spatially, warming is highlighted by significant increases in positive trend, ranging between 0.8 degrees C 1 degrees C in the case of all the 7 stations analyzed, with higher average values in the North in the cold season and South in the warm season. The results were based on analysis of the Gorczynsky index, as well as the application of those recommended by STARDEX: heat wave duration (Txhwd), cold wave duration (Tncwd) 90th percentile (txq90) for the maximum daily values and 10th percentile (tnq10) for minimum daily values.

The movement of the interface between the hot and cold fluids over time causes fluctuations of the inner wall temperature, which can lead to the stress variations and structural thermal fatigue. Therefore, accurate inner wall temperature data detailing the fluctuations is essential for analysis and predictions of thermal fatigue of the piping. In the present study, the conjugate gradient method (CGM) is applied to solve the three-dimensional inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) to estimate the unknown temperature fluctuations on the inner wall of a pipe elbow from simulated outer temperature measurements. First, the direct heat conduction problem is solved using the finite element method (FEM) to produce the outer and inner wall temperatures. Then, the inverse heat conduction problem is solved to estimate the inner wall temperatures based on the outer wall temperature data. The accuracy of the inverse algorithm is then examined by comparing the estimated inner wall temperatures with the exact temperatures from the direct solution. The numerical results show that the inner wall temperature of the elbow can be accurately estimated by using the present algorithm for the test case considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We derive a simple formula for the QW shape that reproduces a given spectrum exactly in the energy, transition, and inertial subranges. We also show that simple QW shapes can be normalized to yield an analytic expression for a temperature spectrum that is fairly close to any given spectrum. As an example, we match the Gaussian QW model to the von Karman spectrum as closely as possible, and find remarkably good agreement in all subranges including the dissipation subrange. We also derive formulae for the variance and kurtosis associated with the QW model, and show how the latter depends on the QW packing fraction and size distribution.

Experimental results show that rolling motion induces the flow fluctuate periodically, and the amplitude of fluctuation decreases sharply with increasing Reynolds number. The periodic oscillation of flow rate causes the temperature of outlet water and outer surface of the heating wall fluctuate periodically. The amplitudes of fluctuation for both outlet water temperature and outer surface temperature of heating wall increase with increasing rolling amplitude and rolling frequency in the turbulent region. The heat transfer coefficient under rolling motion was almost the same as that in steady condition in turbulence region. The reason is that the flow rate fluctuates with small amplitude at relatively high flow rate, thus the effect of rolling motion on the heat transfer is negligible in this experiment.",NA,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUCLEAR ENGINEERING,NA,NA,"ASME, Nucl Engn Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Chinese Nucl Soc","JUL 29-AUG 02, 2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,B,NA,0,WOS:000359512800106,0,0,0,0,0,0,V004T09A106,NA,2014,NA,NA,978-0-7918-5581-2,"Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA",21st International Conference on Nuclear Engineering (ICONE21),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ASME,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Characteristics of Heat Transfer in a Narrow Rectangular Channel under Rolling Motion.,excluded,NA

High-frequency temperature fluctuations caused no deviations from typical coevolutionary arms race dynamics. However, coevolution was stalled during periods of high temperature under intermediate-and low-frequency fluctuations, generating temporary coevolutionary cold spots. Temperature variation affected population density, providing evidence that eco-evolutionary feedbacks act through variable bacteria-phage encounter rates.

The comparison with RMS profiles was less satisfactory in the center of the main tube, but was of good quality in the near-wall region. In the second simulation, the main movement of the fluid is affected by the spiral paths created by the swirl velocity caused at the cold inlet, which improves the mixing of hot and cold fluids downstream of the T-junction.

A living wall has been introduced as an appropriate way to reduce the urban heat island phenomenon. To achieve the purpose, a living wall was applied to the body of a controllable chamber, and two data loggers for temperature and humidity were used. In the first experiment, three types of walls, including a wall without plants, a wall with panels and a living wall, are compared for three consecutive days. In the second experiment, a device is placed adjacent to the living wall and another is placed in the same condition in front of a part of the wall that does not have plants. These data were recorded for 24 h a day over 10 days and compared. This research was conducted in Shiraz, Iran, which has a hot, semi-arid climate. To validate the results, a computer simulation with the ENVI-met program was used. The results show that the panel living wall system can reduce the ambient air temperature by up to 8.7 degrees C. Additionally, the living wall reduces the temperature fluctuations by decreasing the maximum and increasing the minimum temperatures of the ambient air.

In test blanket modules (TBM), which are prototypes of a blanket for a demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO) and which are intended for experimental investigations at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), liquid metals are assumed to fulfil simultaneously the functions of (i) a tritium breeder, (ii) a coolant, and (iii) neutron moderator and multiplier. This approach to testing experimentally design solutions is motivated by plans to employ, in the majority of the currently developed DEMO blanket projects, liquid metals pumped through pipes and/or rectangular channels in a transvers magnetic field. At the present time, experiments that would directly simulate liquid-metal flows under conditions of ITER TBM and/or DEMO blanket operation (irradiation with thermonuclear neutrons, a cyclic temperature regime, and a magnetic-field strength of about 4 to 10 T) are not implementable for want of equipment that could reproduce simultaneously the aforementioned effects exerted by thermonuclear plasmas. This is the reason why use is made of an iterative approach to experimentally estimating the performance of design solutions for liquid-metal channels via simulating one or simultaneously two of the aforementioned factors. Therefore, the investigations reported in the present article are of considerable topical interest. The respective experiments were performed on the basis of the mercury magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) loop that is included in the structure of the MPEI-JIHT MHD experimental facility. Temperature fields were measured under conditions of two- and one-sided heating, and data on averaged-temperature fields, distributions of the wall temperature, and statistical fluctuation features were obtained. A substantial effect of counter thermo gravitational convection (TGC) on averaged and fluctuating quantities were found. The development of TGC in the presence of a magnetic field leads to the appearance of low-frequency fluctuations whose anomalously high intensity exceeds severalfold the level of turbulence fluctuations. This effect manifest itself over a broad region of regime parameters. It was confirmed that low-energy fluctuations penetrate readily through the wall; therefore, it is necessary to study this effect further-in particular, from the point of view of the fatigue strength of the walls of liquid-metal channels.",1063-7788,NA,79,7,1170-1180,NA,NA,NA,1562-692X,NA,J,NA,0,WOS:000394355000004,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,Dec-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Investigation of Heat Transfer in Liquid-Metal Flows under Fusion-Reactor Conditions.,excluded,NA

Thus, one could hypothesize that not only the microbial community would be adapted to high temperatures, but also have a large temperature range conducive for growth. We determined the temperature sensitivity of the soil bacterial community from the Chihuahuan Desert, Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA, using leucine incorporation as a proxy for bacterial growth. Soil samples were taken during early spring and mid-summer from the surface (0-5 cm) and deeper (15-20 cm) soil layers. Mean winter soil temperature preceding the spring samples was 15 degrees C and in summer 36 degrees C at both depths, but with larger amplitude in the top soil than deeper down. T-min was significantly lower in the top 0-5 cm than at 15-20 cm, -1.2 and 0.0 degrees C, respectively. T-opt also was higher in the top soil than deeper down, 42.9 and 41.4 degrees C, respectively, resulting in a larger temperature range for growth (T-opt - T-min) in the top soil reflecting the larger temperature fluctuations in this layer. There were no significant differences in cardinal temperatures for bacterial growth in soils sampled in early spring and mid-summer despite large seasonal differences in temperatures, showing that long periods of colder temperatures was less important than periods of high temperatures as selection pressure for temperature sensitivity. Comparing with earlier results from Antarctic soils (Rinnan et al., 2009), which in contrast represent an extremely low temperature environment, we suggest that the range of temperature cardinal temperatures for soil bacterial communities globally varies from around -15 to 0 degrees C for T-min and 25 to 45 degrees C for T-opt.

To address this issue international standards (viz., ASME-OM-05) require monitoring of structural integrity of reactor core in nuclear power plants. A reactor internals vibration monitoring system (IVMS) has been developed for nuclear power plant surveillance. The system detects the core barrel motion and flow-induced vibrations of reactor internals by analyzing the inherent fluctuations (reactor noise) present in the neutron flux signals from ex-core neutron detectors. Before application of the IVMS in nuclear power plants the system hardware and methodology/software has been extensively tested on the research reactor through a series of reactor noise measurements. In the noise measurements the neutron flux signals were correlated with the signals from vibration sensors mounted on reactor structure and control rods drive mechanisms. The frequency spectra of reactor power signals obtained with IVMS had shown small oscillations in the neutron flux signals at well-defined frequencies. There was a strong correlation of these fluctuations with the establishment of coolant flow through the core. With the help of elaborate experiments using the IVMS the cause of oscillations in neutron flux signals was attributed to the flow-induced vibrations of control rods, and the particular vibrating control rod was identified. The magnitude of the displacement of vibrating control rod was calculated from the measured power spectral density of neutron power signals. It has been shown that ex-core neutron noise measurements are more sensitive in determining the dynamic behavior of reactor internals than the vibration sensors mounted at remote, out-of-the core locations.",0018-9499,NA,55,3,1670-1677,"OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006",NA,NA,NA,NA,J,NA,6,WOS:000256967900015,0,6,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,Jun-08,NA,NA,NA,"San Diego, CA",15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and and Gamma-Ray Detectors,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Detection of Flow-Induced Vibration of Reactor Internals by Neutron Noise Analysis.,excluded,NA

At the moment humans special receptors EMFs have not discovered. However, even small strength ELFEMF with non-thermal energy, corresponding to the natural level, lead to significant biological effects. The brain of man and animals is particularly sensitive to the action of weak fields. In this work, the exposure to ELFEF was carried out in the form of a sequence of variables (bipolar) rectangular voltage pulses forming an electric field, with changes in the repetition frequency in the range from 80 to 30 Hz, as close as possible to the place of impact without physical contact of the field source with the body. The amplitude of the output pulses forming the electric field was 210... 220 V, the resistance at the electrode output is more than 2 MOmega. Exposure was carried out on the region of the back with an average speed of source movement for 10 minutes symmetrically relative to the spine for cervical, thoracic and lumbar. Two courses of 10 procedures were performed. Thermograms of the distribution of temperature fields along the body were obtained. Before the measurement began, the undressed body was adapted to the ambient temperature for 10 minutes. Further during the whole measurement the human was not dressed. Measurements of the temperature field occurred before the procedure, immediately after it, and then several times after the procedure. In total, the dynamics of the thermal fields and their distribution along the body were observed for 120 minutes. It was shown that the temperature of the body surface was lower than the original between 0 and 20 min after exposure, and then there an overall heating of the body with a maximum of 40...60 minutes after the procedure was observed. Decrease and subsequently increase in temperature was observed from the back and front, so we can speak of not a local reaction to the exposure, but of the general response of the body. The greatest temperature changes were observed at the horizontal level under the blades. To verify the version of the possible addictive of the organism to the exposure to ELFEF, a similar visualization of the back's thermal field in the course of repeated exposure was made. Comparison of the data of the first and repeated course of exposure revealed a similar character of the temperature curves, i.e. absence of habituation. Since there is no change in the external environment during and after the exposure to nonthermal energy ELFEF in our case, peripheral temperature receptors of skin should not be involved in observable effect. From the literature data it is known that after the action of EF, inhibition of the hypothalamus takes place. It seems possible that the decrease in the surface temperature of the body after the exposure to ELFEF occurs due to inhibition of the hypothalamus, which ultimately leads to an increase in heat transfer. The increase in body surface temperature observed after its fall can be explained by activation of the center of heat production due to a decrease in temperature in the hypothalamus caused by the previous process of heat loss by the body. . 10- 80 30 .",1560-4136,NA,NA,8,35-40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J,NA,0,RSCI:30067455,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,2017,", .. and , .. and , ..",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Study of the Effect of an Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Field on the Human Body Surface Temperature .,excluded,NA

In this study, we observed that the number of petals of R. chinensis 'Old Blush' flowers increased and decreased in response to low-and high-temperature treatments, respectively, similar to previous reports. We characterized these variations in further detail and found that the number of stamens exhibited the opposite trend. We cloned an APETALA2 homolog, RcAP2. A detailed analysis of gene structure and promoter cis-acting elements as well as RcAP2 temporospatial expression patterns and responses to temperature changes suggested that RcAP2 expression may be related to the number of petals from stamen origin. The overexpression of RcAP2 in Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants may induce the transformation of stamens to petals, thereby increasing the number of petals.

The mean dissipation rate of the temperature variance is measured on the axis of a heated turbulent round jet. Measurements are performed with a constant current anemometer (CCA) operating fine Pt-10%Rh wires at very low overheat. The CCA developed for this purpose uses a current injection method in order to estimate the time constant of the wire. In the first part of the paper, it is shown that the time constants obtained for two wire diameters (d = 1.2 and 0.58 mum) compare well with those measured at the same time using two other methods (laser excitation and pulsed wire method). Moreover, for these two wires, the estimated time constants are in good agreement with those obtained from theory. In the second part of the paper, a compensation procedure, involving post-processing filtering, is developed in order to improve the frequency response of the cold-wire probes. Measurements on the jet axis (Re-D = 16 500, Re-lambda = 167) show that the frequency response of the 1.2 mum wire is indeed significantly improved after compensation. The spectrum of the compensated signal for the 1.2 mum wire compares fairly well with that for the 0.58 mum wire. The results also indicate that the compensation should be applied when the cut-off frequency of the cold-wire f(C) is less than about 2f(K), where f(K) is the Kolmogorov frequency. When f(C) approximate to 0.6f(K), the compensation can reduce the error in the estimated mean dissipation rate by more than 20%. When f(C) = 2f(K) the reduction is about 5%.

This paper describes the apparatus design and procedures for freezing gallium mantles and realizing gallium melting and triple points. Also, investigations on the melting behavior of a gallium melting point cell and of gallium triple point cells were carried out while controlling the temperature outside the gallium point cells at 30 degrees C, 30.5 degrees C, 31 degrees C, and 31.5 degrees C. The obtained melting plateau curves show dentate temperature oscillations on the melting plateaus for the gallium point cells when thermal couplings occurred between the outer and inner liquid-solid interfaces. The maximum amplitude of the temperature fluctuations was about 1.5 mK. Therefore, the temperature oscillations can be used to indicate the ending of the equilibrium phase transitions. The duration and amplitude of such temperature oscillations depend on the temperature difference between the setting temperature and the gallium point temperature; the smaller the temperature difference, the longer the duration of both the melting plateaus and the temperature fluctuations.",0094-243X,NA,1552,NA,237-242-Measurements Int; Chino Corp; ICL Calibrat Lab; INSCO Instrumentat Serv;-Sensing Devices; Liu Res Lab; Thermoprobe; Rocky Mt Tissue Bank; Lake-Shore Cryotron; Thermoworks; Tovey Engn; Palmer Wahl Instrumentat Grp-US Natl Inst Standards & Technol; Measurement Sci Conf; Fluke Corp;,"MAR 19-23, 2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,S,NA,0,WOS:000331284900041,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,2013,NA,"Meyer, CW",978-0-7354-1178-4,"Los Angeles, CA",9th International Temperature Symposium on Temperature - Its Measurement and and Control in Science and Industry,NA,AIP Conference Proceedings,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Automated Realization of the Gallium Melting and Triple Points.,excluded,NA

In the present paper we consider a fluid subjected to a stationary temperature gradient. Two different physical mechanisms have been identified by which the temperature gradient causes long-ranged fluctuations. One cause is the presence of couplings between fluctuating fields. Secondly, spatial variation of the strength of random forces, resulting from the local version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, has also been shown to generate long-ranged fluctuations. We evaluate the contributions to the long-ranged temperature fluctuations due to both mechanisms. While the inhomogeneously correlated Langevin noise does lead to long-ranged fluctuations, in practice, they turn out to be negligible as compared to nonequilibrium temperature fluctuations resulting from the coupling between temperature and velocity fluctuations.",0022-4715,NA,115,6-May,1341-1359,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J,"de Zarate, Jose Maria Ortiz/C-3268-2011",47,WOS:000221480100006,0,47,0,0,0,0,NA,"de Zarate, Jose Maria Ortiz/0000-0002-5039-4410",Jun-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,On the Physical Origin of Long-Ranged Fluctuations in Fluids in Thermal Nonequilibrium States.,excluded,NA

The purpose of this system is to measure a foctal heart signal in a clinical environment. For cooling a first demonstrator version, a closed-cycle Joule Thomson cooler from APD Cryogenics the Cryotiger((R))- was selected. In this work, the Cryotiger is characterised with respect to three noise generating mechanisms: electromagnetic interference, mechanical vibrations and temperature fluctuations. The electromagnetic interference of the cold tip was below the resolution Of Our 3-axis fluxgate magnetometer (7 pT/rootHz). The interference from the compressor, however, requires it to be placed 2 in or more from the sensor head in order to remain below the environmental power line disturbances. As mechanical vibrations of a magnetometer in a background field the earth magnetic field with result in an apparent field at the frequency of vibration, we require the rotation of the cold tip to remain below 200 murad in the frequency band of interest (0.5 100 Hz). This was checked by applying a magnetic field to a SQUID magnetometer mounted on the cooler's cold tip. In this way, rotations of 3 murad and translations of 40 nm of the Cryotiger were measured; both at a frequency of 49 Hz. A further issue with respect to Our application is the fluctuation in operating temperature. Under no-load operation, the temperature occasionally increased from around 70 K to about 82 K, With a load of roughly 2 W, a temperature of about 74 K was obtained, which increased about 2 K over a 20 day period.

Jaime and Roy, Jacques",Germination of an obligate seeder (Ulex parviflorus) and consequences for wildfire management,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.foreco.2008.05.014,2008,"In fire-prone ecosystems, reducing the risk of wildfire is generally attempted through vegetation clearing using controlled fires or, less often, mechanical techniques. Management practices, however, can be poorly efficient when the disturbances they introduce install environmental conditions that are similar to the ones under which the undesirable species evolved. Ulex parviflorus is a Mediterranean obligate seeder with physical dormancy forming large amounts of highly combustible standing necromass. In the present study, combining field and laboratory experiments, we determined the seedling recruitment of this species under different management practices (burning, mechanical clearing, slash/no slash on soil surface), we measured the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and moisture) enforced by these practices and we tested their individual and combined impact on germination in order to determine the most appropriate control method for this species. Germination is low under intact canopies, but it is strongly stimulated by both brush-chipping and fire. This is partly related to the inhibiting effect of the low red:far-red ratio of the light filtered by the canopy which is removed by brush-chipping and fire. The other factor involved is moderate heat, either fire-generated or resulting from solar radiation on bare soil, which breaks seed coat impermeability. Indeed exposing seeds on bare soil in summer resulted in a significant increase in their germination capacity and germination was reduced when the brush chips remained on the soil. Moisture fluctuations did not enhance germination. The summer heat impact affects management practices. When the brush-chipping treatment occurred before summer, the germination flush appeared the following autumn, but when the treatment occurred after summer, the germination flush did not appear until the autumn of the subsequent year, when interspecific competition with regenerating vegetation is likely to be more intense. We demonstrated that brush-chipping, especially when done after summer, is a better technique than fire for controlling U. parviflorus because it creates environmental conditions that are less favourable for its germination. This technique also has the potential to favour late-successional species less vulnerable to fire. By combining fuel reduction and land restoration, this technique is useful to the sustainable management policies that need to be developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we present temporally-based statistics of temperature fluctuations at multiple simultaneous spatial positions with a specific focus on characterizing the effects of Reynolds number. DLR B (Re = 22,800) was found to exhibit a much higher probability of large temporal gradients as compared to DLR A (Re = 15,200). While the higher Reynolds number should promote higher fluctuations, the levels were commensurate with an increased effect due to high levels of local flame extinction and re-ignition in DLR B as compared to DLR A. The joint probability density function between the temperature fluctuation and the natural logarithm of the square of the temporal gradient was examined across flame conditions. At an axial position of forty nozzle diameters downstream (x/d = 40), DLR A exhibited statistical independence, while DLR B exhibited a negative correlation between the two quantities. These results suggest a Reynolds number-dependence on the spatial development of statistical independence. Integral time scales also are reported for both flames as a function of axial and radial position. The integral time scales are seen to increase with increasing axial and radial position and decrease with increasing Reynolds number as expected from theory. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

We observe the time and surface averaged radiation fluxes from these objects. These fluxes depend on both the mean temperature and averaged temperature fluctuations. The usual photosphere models do not take into account the temperature fluctuations and use only the distribution of the mean temperature into surface layers of stars. We investigate how the temperature fluctuations change the spectra in continuum assuming that the degree of fluctuations (the ratio of mean temperature fluctuation to the mean temperature) is small. We suggest the procedure of calculation of continuum spectra, which takes into account the temperature fluctuations. As a first step one uses the usual model of a photosphere without fluctuations. The observed spectrum is presented as a part depending on mean temperature and the additional part proportional to quadratic value of fluctuation degree. It is shown that for some forms of absorption factor the additional part in Wien's region of spectrum can be evaluated directly from observed spectrum. This part depends on the first and second wavelength derivatives, which can be calculated numerically from the observed spectrum. Our estimates show that the temperature dependence of absorption factors is very important by calculation of continuum spectra corrections.

To explain the influence of immiscible liquid flow on the heat transfer coefficient, hydrodynamics and phase holdup have also been discussed. It is found that the increase in the velocities of dispersed and continuous liquid phases results in the increase of turbulence in the column, which makes the system more complicated and irregular, The injection of gas (air) or particles (6.0 mm glass bead) into the column can increase the heat transfer coefficient considerably, However, the flow behavior of the immiscible mixture is more irregular and chaotic owing to the injection of gas, whereas the system has been more uniform and periodic by adding the solid particles into the column.

The estimation of cloud droplet effect on the readings of the high-frequency aircraft thermometer employed at the Central Aerological Observatory (CAO) was based on an experimental study of the sensor in a wind tunnel, using an air flow containing liquid water droplets. Simultaneously, calculations of the distribution of speed and temperature in a flow through the sensitive element of the sensor were fulfilled. This permitted estimating the coefficient of water content effect on temperature readings. Another way of estimating cloud droplet effect was based on the analysis of data obtained during aircraft observations of cumulus clouds in a tropical zone (Cuba Island). As a result, a method of correcting air temperature and recovering true air temperature fluctuations inside clouds was developed. This method has provided consistent patterns of heat flux distribution in a cumulus area. Analysis of the results of aircraft observations of cumulus clouds with temperature correction fulfilled has permitted investigation of the spectral structure of the fields of air temperature and heat fluxes to be performed in cumulus zones based on wavelet transformation.

We studied within-generation plasticity and transgenerational effects of thermal conditions on temperature tolerance and demographic parameters inDrosophila melanogaster. We employed a fully factorial design, in which both parental (P) and offspring generations (F1) were reared in a constant or a variable thermal environment. Thermal variability during ontogeny increased heat tolerance in P, but with demographic cost as this treatment resulted in substantially lower survival, fecundity, and net reproductive rate. The adverse effects of thermal variability (V) on demographic parameters were less drastic in flies from the F1, which exhibited higher net reproductive rates than their parents. These compensatory responses could not totally overcome the challenges of the thermally variable regime, contrasting with the offspring of flies raised in a constant temperature (C) that showed no reduction in fitness with thermal variation. Thus, the parental thermal environment had effects on thermal tolerance and demographic parameters in fruit fly.

Related changes in offshore transport led those of the surf-zone temperature by about one day. A transfer of kinetic energy from the alongshore wind into the temperature field of the nearshore zone dominated relative short time scales (hourly).

We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that TPCs are fixed during ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-specific ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change.

Mean temperature maps were used to identify specific locations (lines) of interest on the impingement surface for transient experiments. Low-magnitude, periodically repeating thermal streaks were observed for the Y/D-h = 5.0 jet impingement, suggesting the presence of near-wall streamwise counter-rotating vortex pairs along the impingement line. For the Y/D-h = 0.50 jet impingement, temperature streaks at the impingement line were not detected; however, distinct thermal streaks were observed at locations corresponding to the local minimum and secondary maximum in heat transfer. To better understand the trends in the temperature oscillations, the time series were analyzed using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. Approximately 80% of the variance in temperature fluctuations at the impingement line could be reconstructed from five modes for the Y/D-h = 5.0 jet impingement.

By smoothing temperature data with the robust LOESS method, we obtain temperature fluctuations that cannot be explained by insolation or atmospheric heat loss. Statistical distributions of these temperature fluctuations are investigated with sensitivities to the distance from the ice-ocean interface, average ice temperature, and sea ice structure.

While this species has been a model organism for understanding physiological adaptations to extreme environments, lacking are corroborative in situ experiments and characterization of temperature-related behaviors representing the lower thermal tolerance range of this species. To address this knowledge gap, we first quantified the upper thermal limit for this species using a rapid heating protocol executed remotely on the seafloor. Second, we used a combination of in situ observations and shipboard experiments to test for temperature-dependent patterns in activity and behavior. We confirm that P. sulfincola is remarkably eurythermal and demonstrates a thermal niche breadth exceeding 45 degrees C. We further show that the activity and positioning of worms relate to temperatures within its lower preferred range (i.e., between 4 and 20 degrees C). Worms tended to remain closer to their tube openings and held their branchial crown in a consistent location when fluids were relatively warm. By contrast, when fluids were cooler, both the distance worms were observed from their tubes and positioning of their branchial crown were more variable. A Bayesian hidden Markov model classified each worm at each time interval as being in a high or low activity state according to the magnitude of change in their orientation and how far they moved between successive time lapse images. We found that the transition between active and inactive states at any time period is related to fluid temperature. Our observations indicate that the behavior of the worms is temperature-dependent, which may in turn reflect temperature-related variables such as the delivery of food particles, dissolved oxygen concentration, or relative environmental variability. Our findings demonstrate that this species can respond behaviorally to very fine-scale environmental variability in a manner not simply predicted by models of increasing activity with temperature.

While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions.

An increase in the rate of carbonation was noticed along with elevated carbonation temperatures. A temperature rise from 10 to 40 degrees was accompanied by a ten-fold increase in initial reaction rate and was corroborated by a corresponding stimulated release of magnesium in pore water as evidenced by residue leaching experiments. Furthermore, significant heat was generated during reaction progress which led to a rise in temperature up to 4.9 degrees C at a 10 degrees C carbonation temperature. The rate of carbonation was found to be reduced by the increase of iron (III) content in the pore water fostered by the presence of dissolved oxygen. Formation of iron hydroxides induced pore water acidification which stimulated carbonation. This was counterbalanced by the ensuing precipitation of iron (III) hydroxide as a thin coating which slowed the progress of carbonation. Using weakly concentrated CDTA-chelating ligands helped curb iron (III) precipitation which ensured higher carbonation rates under an oxic environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examined the effect of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term physiological parameters (metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance (survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed overwintering prepupae to a series of low temperatures (-10, -15 or -20 degrees C) with increasing numbers of freezing events (3, 6 or 10) with differing recovery periods between events (1, 5 or 10 days). Repeated freezing increased sorbitol concentration by about 50% relative to a single freezing episode, and prompted prepupae to modify long-chain triacylglycerols to acetylated triacylglycerols. Long-term, repeated freezing did not significantly reduce survival but did reduce egg production by 9.8% relative to a single freezing event.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effect of constant 30 degrees C or ambient temperature fluctuation at two different locations, Sime Darby Oil Palm Breeding Seed Processing Renggam, Johor and the Seed Production Unit (SPU) Banting, Selangor on oil palm D x P seed germination. At both locations, final mean germination percentage and speed were higher at fluctuating temperatures compared with constant 30 degrees C. Under fluctuating conditions, the Oil Palm Breeding Seed Processing Renggam environment resulted in higher germination (85.8%) compared with SPU Banting (69.8%). Thus, the higher temperature amplitude (difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures) was an important factor, resulting in higher germination.

Measurements of temperature fluctuations in the silicon melt zone due to time-dependent thermocapillary convection (Marangoni convection) and an observation of the microscopic growth rate were simultaneously performed during the experiment. Temperature fluctuations of about 0.5-0.7 degrees C with a frequency range <0.5 Hz were detectable. The microscopic growth rate fluctuates considerably around the average growth rate of I mm/min: Growth rates up to 3-4 mm/min, close to zero mm/min, as well as negative values (backmelting) were observed. Dopant striations are clearly visible in the Sb-doped crystal. They were characterized by spreading resistance measurements and differential interference contrast microscopy. The frequencies of temperature fluctuations, microscopic growth rates, and the dopant inhomogeneities correspond quite well, with main frequencies between 0.1 sind 0.3 Wt. 3D numerical simulations were performed to predict the optimum position of the temperature sensor, and the characteristic temperature amplitudes and frequencies.

Studies on coral resistance mechanisms have proposed a correlation between shuffling of different Symbiodiniaceae genera (changing the dominant Symbiodiniaceae genera) and putative thermal tolerance in corals. Although it was suggested that some corals can increase their tolerance by 1.0-1.5 degrees C through shuffling to thermally tolerant Durusdinium trenchii (formerly D1a), the effects of accumulated thermal stress due to prolonged high temperatures on the survival of corals that have shuffled have not been investigated. We show herein that prolonged exposure to high temperature (> 10.43-degree heating weeks) can drastically reduce coral survival rate even after it has shuffled to stress-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae genera.

Their fitness, measured by intrinsic growth rate and net reproductive rate, is partially driven by biochemical processes. Thus, it is a function of ambient temperature. Biochemical processes may not be approximated well by yearly mean temperature alone when temperature cycles yearly, largely. Higher order moments may also be important. The amplitude of yearly fluctuations of monthly and seasonal sea temperatures varies dramatically across the northern temperate regions. Thus, they can impact the fitness, thereby the colonization potential of copepods migrating across such region. To investigate this, we derive approximate metrics of periodic (yearly) fitness: the yearly intrinsic growth rate, and a weighted net reproductive rate. We use them to measure the persistence and the growth of an Allee-effect free, stage-structured, fast-maturing, small population of invasive copepods that reproduces year-round in habitats with yearly temperature cycles. We show that the yearly fitness increases substantially when a population is introduced from a habitat with large amplitude to that with small amplitude yearly fluctuating temperatures, given that their mean temperatures and other environmental and ecological factors are constant. The detected range-expansion of the modeled species matches the potential fitness gradient predicted by the metrics.

Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C) fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions.

Here, knowledge of the pattern of energy usage and losses of each component in the plant is highly useful in the process energy optimization. Moreover, it is essential to maintain the melt quality while improving the energy efficiency in polymer processing. In this work, an investigation was made on the total energy consumption, drive motor energy consumption, power factor and the melt temperature profile across the die melt flow (as an indication of the melt thermal quality) of an industrial scale extruder with three different screw geometries, three polymer types and wide range of processing conditions (altogether 135 different processing situations were observed). This aims to widen the knowledge on process energy and thermal behaviors while exploring possible correlation's between energy demand and melt quality (in terms of melt temperature fluctuations across the melt flow). The results showed that the level and fluctuations of the extruder's power factor is particularly dependent upon the material being processed. Moreover, it seems that there is a relation between the level of energy demand of the heaters and the level of melt temperature fluctuations. While the extruder specific energy consumption decreases with increasing screw speed, specific energy consumption of the drive motor may have either increasing or decreasing behavior. Overall, this study provides new insights in a wide range on process energy demand and melt thermal quality in polymer extrusion. Moreover, further research is recommended to establish strong correlation's between process energy consumption and melt thermal quality which should help to enhance process control and hence the product quality in single screw polymer extrusion.

We found statistical characterizations for both strong and weak fluctuations. In terms of probability density functions ( pdfs) of Delta(r)theta, weak and strong fluctuations reflect themselves in different rescaling properties of pdf cores and tails, respectively. For the cores, the observed rescaling is P(Delta(r)theta) =r(-alpha)(P) over tilde(Delta(r)theta/r(alpha)); while for the tails, data are compatible with P(Delta(r)theta) alpha r(zeta infinity). Such two rescaling properties are equivalent to saying <vertical bar Delta(r)theta vertical bar(p)> similar to r(zeta p), with zeta(p) = alpha p for small p's and zeta(p) = zeta(infinity) = constant for large p's.

During the past seventy years there have been numerous experimental efforts to accurately measure air temperature as a function of altitude and, through careful data analysis, provide statistics describing these fluctuations and the associated fluctuations in temperature gradients. In addition, several researchers suggest the presence of atmospheric layers or ""sheets"" where the statistics describing fluctuations in air temperature can vary significantly from layer to layer. Herein, we propose a model to represent fluctuations of air temperature within a layered atmosphere. The model is a special type of inhomogeneous non-Gaussian differentiable random process and can be calibrated to available data on the marginal statistics and spectral content of the fluctuating temperature field, as well as the associated first derivative of the process representing fluctuations in temperature gradients. Properties of the proposed model are presented, and statistical realizations of the fluctuating temperature field and its gradient are computed and presented for illustration. The random vibration response of a spacecraft falling to Earth through these fluctuating conditions is then considered to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet there are beleaguering issues towards fundamental understanding of this process. One of the curious observations is the appearance of unavoidable dispersions in nucleation and growth rates of crystalline materials grown under homogenous bulk conditions. These dispersions can contribute significantly towards polydispersity in crystalline products. The classical models such as Gibbs critical nucleation theory and Burton-Cabrera-Frank growth models primarily relate nucleation and growth to supersaturation. Therefore, the dispersions in nucleation and growth rates can be related to the local fluctuations in supersaturation. These local fluctuations are driven by the Brownian motion of solute molecules which affects the local concentration and temperature and hence supersaturation. This article presents a stochastic model to describe fluctuations in supersaturation and thereby dispersions in crystalline materials. The stochastic model is derived from the framework of density and temperature fluctuations. The resulting dispersions in size and shape of nuclei are obtained by multi-dimensional maximization of Gibbs free energy in morphology domain of potassium acid phthalate. The model predictions are validated with the experimental measurements of growth rate dispersions in potassium acid phthalate crystals. The proposed framework provides the first ab initio predictions for the observed dispersions in crystallization processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) of placental origin have shown therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of numerous pathologies of varied etiology. Up to now, cryopreservation is the only effective way to preserve the viability and unique properties of such cells in the long term. However, practical biobanking is often associated with repeated temperature fluctuations or interruption of a cold chain due to various technical, transportation, and stocking events. While biochemical processes are expected to be suspended during cryopreservation, such temperature fluctuations may lead to accumulation of stress as well as to periodic release of water fractions in the samples, possibly leading to damage during long-term storage. Methods: In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of changes in cell survival, vital parameters, and differentiation potential, as well as transgene expression of placental MSCs after temperature fluctuations within the liquid nitrogen steam storage, mimicking long-term preservation in practical biobanking, transportation, and temporal storage. Results: It was shown that viability and metabolic parameters of placental MSCs did not significantly differ after temperature fluctuations in the range from -196 degrees C to -100 degrees C in less than 20 cycles in comparison to constant temperature storage. However, increasing the temperature range to -80 degrees C as well as increasing the number of cycles leads to significant lowering of these parameters after thawing. The number of apoptotic changes increases depending on the number of cycles of temperature fluctuations. Besides, adhesive properties of the cells after thawing are significantly compromised in the samples subjected to temperature fluctuations during storage. Differentiation potential of placental MSCs was not compromised after cryopreservation with constant end temperatures or with temperature fluctuations. However, regulation of various genes after cryopreservation procedures significantly varies. Interestingly, transgene expression was not compromised in any of the studied samples. Conclusions: Alterations in structural and functional parameters of placental MSCs after long-term preservation should be considered in practical biobanking due to potential temperature fluctuations in samples.

Sensible heat flux, surface friction velocity and turbulent velocities are estimated from measurements of mean wind speed and the standard deviation of temperature fluctuations at a single level on a tower at two suburban sites and at one urban site in Riverside, California. These estimates are compared with observations made at these sites during a field study conducted in 2007. The sensible heat flux is overestimated in the urban area, while it is underestimated at a suburban site when temperature fluctuations are used in the free convection formulation to estimate heat flux. The bias in heat flux estimates can be reduced through a correction that depends on stability. It turns out that the bias in heat flux estimates has a minor effect on the prediction of surface friction velocity and turbulent velocities. Estimates of sensible heat flux, surface friction velocity and turbulent velocities are sensitive to estimates of aerodynamic roughness length, and we suggest estimating the aerodynamic roughness length through detailed micrometeorological measurements made during a limited field study. An examination of the impact of the uncertainty in estimating surface micrometeorology on concentrations indicates that, at small distances from a surface release, ground-level concentrations computed using estimates of heat flux and surface friction compare well with the those based on observed values: the bias is small and the 95% confidence interval of the ratio of the two concentrations is 1.7. However, at distances much larger than the Obukhov length, this confidence interval is close to 2.3 because errors in both friction velocity and heat flux affect plume spread. Finally, we show that using measurements of temperature fluctuations in estimating heat flux is an improvement on that based on the surface energy balance, even when net radiation measurements are available.",0006-8314,NA,135,2,269-289,NA,NA,NA,1573-1472,NA,J,"Venkatram, Akula/AAK-9467-2020; PRINCEVAC, MARKO/",2,WOS:000276709400005,0,2,0,1,0,0,NA,"PRINCEVAC, MARKO/0000-0002-3512-7760",May-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,using Temperature Fluctuation Measurements to Estimate Meteorological Inputs for Modelling Dispersion During Convective Conditions in Urban Areas.,excluded,NA

A broad investigation of the magnitude of the phenomenon when assuming the participating medium as gray or as non-gray is first conducted, followed by an analysis of the individual importance of turbulent fluctuations of temperature and species concentrations in the prediction of the mean radiation field. For these purposes, transient data generated by large eddy simulation are compared to results of independent radiative transfer calculations initialized with mean temperature and medium composition fields. A new methodology is proposed to isolate the influence of each fluctuating scalar on the overall TRI. In all test cases, turbulence-radiation interaction was found to increase the region of radiation loss, leading to differences between 60% and 80% in the radiant fraction of the flame compared to solutions neglecting turbulent fluctuations. When treating the media as non-gray, TRI effects were globally more significant, even though in some parts of the domain simulations employing the gray assumption yielded larger deviations in the mean radiative heat source due to TRI. By isolating the contributions of fluctuations of temperature and fluctuations of species concentrations, the latter resulted in mean radiation fields very similar to the ones obtained by neglecting all scalar fluctuations, while the former, although being closer to the solution considering full TRI effects, still showed differences as high as 60% relative to that solution. These findings indicate that temperature fluctuations are more important to the turbulence-radiation interaction phenomenon, but fluctuations in medium composition need to be taken into account in order to obtain reliable predictions of the mean radiative heat transfer.

Pre-treatments were carried out with calcium, low methoxyl pectin, a combined solution, and results compared with untreated control fruits. Kramer shear, back extrusion, compression, and multiple penetration tests were used to measure rheological behavior. One-hundred mM CaCl2 reduced the long and short-term frozen storage induced loss of firmness. For long-term storage at -18 degrees C, a softening of the tissue became evident between 3 and 12 months and at each date test the stored fruits were firmer than those without storage. For short-term storage with fluctuations, the loss of firmness was evident between 0 and 24 days, and at all the testing dates the stored fruits were softer than those without storage. Results evidenced a higher cell damage in the short-term frozen storage. Coefficients of softening per day suffering fluctuation were determined, the highest values being given by Kramer shear energy and back extrusion maximum force (> 1%). Short-term frozen storage affected physical and physico-chemical characteristics, increasing the saturation (r) and the anthocyanins and decreasing the ascorbic acid of the raspberries. In both storage conditions, pretreatments reduced the drip loss, which correlated best with the Kramer shear energy. Panelists detected mainly time effect on the sensory firmness. For long-term, sensory firmness and juiciness gave the highest correlations with back extrusion maximum force, while for the short-term, sensory firmness and drip loss gave the highest correlations with the Kramer shear energy.

As an example, we document the diverse thermal regimes in Toronto Harbour, which is also the site of some of the most extensive fish habitat restoration activities in Lake Ontario. Toronto Harbour is characterised by considerable thermal variability as a result of diurnal heat fluxes and large amplitude movements of the thermocline of Lake Ontario. During the ice-free period from April-November 2013, an array of benthic and surface temperature loggers were deployed to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution of water temperatures. Complementary measurements of stratification were made in Lake Ontario at a site 5 km offshore. The dominant periods of short-term thermal variability were 12, 17, and 24 h, reflecting both diurnal heat fluxes and inertial oscillations of Lake Ontario's thermocline. The thermocline in Lake Ontario was observed to oscillate by as much as 15 m, around a mean depth of 9 m, which is comparable to the mean depth of Toronto Harbour. Cold intrusions were found to quickly flow from the lake into the harbour and lead to rapid drops in temperature (e.g., as much as 15 degrees C in less than 4 h). Such ""cold shock"" events may be associated with a variety of negative effects on many aquatic organisms, especially warm-water fishes. We consider the potential impacts of the observed temperature variability on cool and warm-water fish species that are the target of restoration activities.

P. and Myers, A.",Efficient estimation by FEA of machine tool distortion due to environmental temperature perturbations,PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.precisioneng.2012.10.006,2013,"Machine tools are susceptible to exogenous influences, which mainly derive from varying environmental conditions such as the day and night or seasonal transitions during which large temperature swings can occur. Thermal gradients cause heat to flow through the machine structure and results in non-linear structural deformation whether the machine is in operation or in a static mode. These environmentally stimulated deformations combine with the effects of any internally generated heat and can result in significant error increase if a machine tool is operated for long term regimes. In most engineering industries, environmental testing is often avoided due to the associated extensive machine downtime required to map empirically the thermal relationship and the associated cost to production. This paper presents a novel offline thermal error modelling methodology using finite element analysis (FEA) which significantly reduces the machine downtime required to establish the thermal response. It also describes the strategies required to calibrate the model using efficient on-machine measurement strategies. The technique is to create an FEA model of the machine followed by the application of the proposed methodology in which initial thermal states of the real machine and the simulated machine model are matched. An added benefit is that the method determines the minimum experimental testing time required on a machine; production management is then fully informed of the cost-to-production of establishing this important accuracy parameter. The most significant contribution of this work is presented in a typical case study; thermal model calibration is reduced from a fortnight to a few hours. The validation work has been carried out over a period of over a year to establish robustness to overall seasonal changes and the distinctly different daily changes at varying times of year. Samples of this data are presented that show that the FEA-based method correlated well with the experimental results resulting in the residual errors of less than 12 mu m. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis, is influenced by water temperature fluctuations caused by the Northern Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass. Here, the effects of acute seawater temperature change, gradual temperature change, and fluctuating temperature on the physiological and enzymatic activities in Yesso scallop were studied. Scallops were transferred directly from rearing temperature (15 degrees C) to 5, 10, or 20 degrees C for the acute water temperature change treatment. Scallops in the gradual water temperature change treatment were acclimated to different temperatures (5, 10, and 20 degrees C) by increasing or decreasing seawater temperature progressively (1-2 degrees C/day). The results showed that oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion rates in the 20 degrees C-acute water temperature change treatment were significantly higher than those in the gradual treatment (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). However, scallop ingestion rate decreased significantly in response to an acute water temperature decrease from 15 to 5 degrees C, compared with equivalent groups exposed to a gradual temperature drop (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). Moreover, hepatopancreatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), acid phosphatase (ACP), and lysozyme (LSZ) activities reached their highest levels in the 20 degrees C-acute treatment after 12 h. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased significantly following the acute water temperature changes and reached the highest level in 10 degrees C-acute treatment after 72 h. Heat shock protein70 gene (Hsp70) expression levels also increased significantly when water temperature was increased rapidly from 15 to 20 degrees C or decreased rapidly from 15 to 10 degrees C (P < 0.01). In the fluctuation treatment, seawater temperature was altered every 12 h for a total of six fluctuations. Scallops were transferred directly from 15 to 7 degrees C (first fluctuation), moved from 7 to 15 degrees C for the next 12 h (second fluctuation), and then transferred from 15 to 7 degrees C again (third fluctuation) and so on. As results, significant increases in SOD and CAT activities and MDA content, and decreases in ACP and LSZ activities were observed (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). Significantly upregulated Hsp70 expression was also found in hemocytes, gills, and the adductor muscle of scallops in the fluctuating temperature treatment (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01).

In treatment 2 (T2), temperature swing was 5 degrees C (mild) which had a total variation of 10 degrees C (Tvar-10) with a minimum of 15 degrees C and maximum of 25 C, treatment 3 (T3) had a variation about the mean of 10 degrees C (moderate) with a total variation of 20 degrees C (Tvar-20) with a minimum of 10 degrees C and maximum of 30 degrees C, or 15 degrees C (severe) swings about the mean in treatment 4 (T4) with a diurnal total variation of 30 C (Tvar-30) with a minimum of 5 C and maximum of 35 C. Leaf area and shoot dry weight of plants in the severe treatment were 30% lower than Controls. Root dry weight in the severe treatment was 30% lower than in the mild treatment. Fruits in the moderate and severe treatments were 22% smaller than in the mild treatment. Fruit soluble sugar content was elevated slightly by RZT fluctuation. Shoot concentrations of N, Mg, Fe, B, Zn were not affected by RZT, but there were small differences in concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mn, and Cu. Nutrient uptake of N and Ca were not affected, but P, K and Mg were about 35% less in Tvar-20 and Tvar-30. RZT variation had no effect on chlorophyll content or number of leaves, maximum carboxylation rate, photosynthetic electron transport rate, maximum CO2 assimilation rate, or fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm and OPSII). There was little effect of RZT on predawn or midday stem water potential (SWP), but the SWP was substantially lowered in the severe treatment at mid -morning when RZT was about 5 C and air vapor pressure deficit was at its daily maximum.

This study was conducted to describe the impacts of a complex, yet typical hydroelectric power scheme in the Swiss Alps on the temperature regime of the utilised river. Between September 1998 and October 2001, temperature was continuously recorded at 20 different locations along the River Ticino (i.e. upstream, downstream, and in the water outlet of every major hydropower installation). Average temperatures on water abstraction sections were higher than natural during summer and lower than natural during winter, but annual temperature sum remained unaltered. Temperature amplitudes exceeded the natural situation in both seasons. Below water releases, in contrast, average temperature was somewhat higher than natural in winter, but much cooler than natural in summer, resulting in a substantial (-59%) annual heat deficit.

(2015) are extended to account for temperature and concentration fluctuations. The newly-developed criteria are applied to negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and non-NTC fuels. The statistical volume-averaged Sankaran number, and the volumetric fraction of Sa < 1, F-Sa,F-S, are proposed as new metrics to determine a priori the combustion modes, combustion intensity, and ignition delay times, with F-Sa,F-S being used to quantify the heat release fraction from spontaneous ignition. It is demonstrated that F-Sa,F-S agrees acceptably with the fraction of heat release from spontaneous ignition obtained by the Damkohler-based analysis from direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The ignition modes can also be predicted by <(S)over bar>a regardless of the NTC and non-NTC characteristics of fuels over a wide range of initial mean temperatures and different fluctuation levels. Besides, the magnitude of can be used to estimate F-Sa,F-S due to its strong correlation with F-Sa,F-S. Additionally, the predicted (S) over bara by the theory, S-ap, is compared with the statistical mean (S) over bara showing a consistent agreement and they are found to correlate with the combustion intensity that is characterized by the maximum heat release rate. Finally, the ignition delay time can be correlated with Sa(p) for single-stage fuels, and for NTC fuels if the initial mean temperature lies outside the NTC regime. (C) 2019 The Combustion Institute.

In a first experiment, soil disturbance and fire were applied to plots in the field with a factorial design in April 1992. In a second experiment, we measured the effect of adding C. clusii litter. The number of seedlings, annual plants and grasses, and the coverage of mosses were recorded in 1993 and 1994. Soil disturbance increased the number of C. clusii seedlings almost seven-fold but did not change the number of grasses, annual plants nor moss cover.

The main objectives were to quantify the observed ignition characteristics and numerically validate the theory of the turbulent ignition regime diagram recently proposed by Im et al. 2015 [29] that provides a framework to predict ignition behavior a priori based on the thermo-chemical properties of the reactant mixture and initial flow and scalar field conditions. Ignition regimes were classified into three categories: weak (where deflagration is the dominant mode of fuel consumption), reaction-dominant strong, and mixing-dominant strong (where volumetric ignition is the dominant mode of fuel consumption). Two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) of auto-ignition in a lean syngas/air mixture with uniform mixture composition at high-pressure, low-temperature conditions were performed in a fixed volume. The initial conditions considered two-dimensional isotropic velocity spectrums, temperature fluctuations and localized thermal hot spots. A number of parametric test cases, by varying the characteristic turbulent Damkohler and Reynolds numbers, were investigated. The evolution of the auto-ignition phenomena, pressure rise, and heat release rate were analyzed. In addition, combustion mode analysis based on front propagation speed and computational singular perturbation (CSP) was applied to characterize the auto-ignition phenomena. All results supported that the observed ignition behaviors were consistent with the expected ignition regimes predicted by the theory of the regime diagram. This work provides new high-fidelity data on syngas ignition characteristics over a broad range of conditions and demonstrates that the regime diagram serves as a predictive guidance in the understanding of various physical and chemical mechanisms controlling auto-ignition in thermally inhomogeneous and compositionally homogeneous turbulent reacting flows.

Until now, the effective temperature (T-eff ) concept, which can integrate the effects of seasonal or monthly temperature fluctuations within a given annual temperature into pavement design, has been utilised, in conjunction with the dynamic modulus (|E*) master curve to determine the representative modulus for an asphalt layer in pavement design. The effective temperature concept is then used to aid the prediction of an asphalt concrete pavement's service life by assuming that the effective temperature is constant throughout a pavement design period (approximately 20-40 years). However, this assumption is not particularly valid in some countries such as Australia, where the effect of climate change can cause significant fluctuations in temperature during a given pavement design period. In this newly proposed framework, the current effective temperature concept is modified to obtain a so-called optimum effective temperature (T-OPT ). From this, the effect of temperature fluctuations during a given design period can be taken into account by using statistically based methods. First, a pavement design scenario was established to demonstrate the new concept. Historical climate data from four study areas in Western Australia was taken and a 10 mm dense graded asphalt mix was used as the basis for pavement design inputs with local material properties and traffic data. Results indicated that optimum pavement design sections, determined according to the new framework considering temperature fluctuations, provided thinner and thicker pavement sections with the cumulative damages (D value) closer to 1 than those of the traditional design approach. The study outcome would result in a more reliable pavement life prediction, leading to saving in construction and maintenance costs.",1468-0629,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oct-20,2164-7402,NA,J,NA,0,WOS:000583824500001,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,New Theoretical Framework for Temperature-Effect Integration into Asphalt Concrete Pavement Life Prediction with Respect to Australian Pavement Conditions.,excluded,NA

To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinas virginianus] and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations.

The thermal stress due to such fast rates of temperature change has been previously implicated in negative effects on many aquatic organisms. The thermocline was observed to move by as much as 20m vertically, and had dominant periods of oscillation of 12, 17 and 24h.

To gain a better understanding of the daily temperature dynamics of malaria mosquito breeding sites and of the relationships between meteorological variables and water temperature, three clear water pools (diameter x depth: 0.16 x 0.04, 0.32 x 0.16 and 0-96 x 0.32 in) were created in Kenya. Continuous water temperature measurements at various depths were combined with weather data collections from a meteorological station. The water pools were homothermic, but the top water layer differed by up to about 2 degrees C in temperature, depending on weather conditions. Although the daily mean temperature of all water pools was similar (27.4-28.1 degrees C) the average recorded difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperature was 14.4 degrees C in the smallest versus 7.1 degrees C in the largest water pool. Average water temperature corresponded well with various meteorological variables. The temperature of each water pool was continuously higher than the air temperature. A model was developed that predicts the diurnal water temperature dynamics accurately, based on the estimated energy budget components of these water pools. The air-water interface appeared the most important boundary for energy exchange processes and on average 82-89% of the total energy was gained and lost at this boundary. Besides energy loss to longwave radiation, loss due to evaporation was high; the average estimated daily evaporation ranged from 4.2 mm in the smallest to 3.7 mm in the largest water pool.

For the growth of single crystals, these techniques attracted a rapidly increasing attention within the last years: a well defined melt flow leads to a more homogeneous temperature and concentration distribution in the melt and consequently improves the growth process. Rotating magnetic fields (RMF) might be used instead of crucible and/or crystal rotation avoiding mechanically induced disturbances or might be added to conventional rotation mechanisms to gain a further flow control parameter. Compared to static magnetic fields, rotating ones are distinguished by a much lower energy consumption and technical effort. Furthermore, there are no reports on detrimental effects such as the generation of thermoelectromagnetic convection or coring effects in the grown crystals. One advantage of rotating magnetic fields is the possibility to apply them even to melts with a rather low electrical conductivity like e.g. aqueous solutions. High flow velocities are already generated with moderate fields. Therefore the field strength has to be adjusted with care because otherwise undesirable Taylor vortices might be induced. In the last years, the potential of rotating magnetic fields for crystal growth processes was demonstrated for model arrangements using e.g. gallium or mercury as a test liquid as well as for a variety of growth techniques like Float Zone, Czochralski, Bridgman, or Travelling Heater Methods: Fluctuations of the heat transport due to time-dependent natural convection have could be reduced by more than an order of magnitude or the mass transport could be improved with respect to the a better radial symmetry and/or a more homogeneous microscopic segregation.",0960-8974,NA,38,4-Jan,38-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J,NA,86,WOS:000083028000002,2,89,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,1999,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rotating Magnetic Fields: Fluid Flow and Crystal Growth Applications.,excluded,NA

This paper presents a numerical study on the transient response of packed bed latent heat thermal energy storage system in removing fluctuations in the heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature during the charging and discharging period. The packed bed consisting of spherical shaped encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) is integrated in an organic Rankine cycle-based solar thermal power plant for electricity generation. A comprehensive numerical model is developed using flow equations for HTF and two-temperature non-equilibrium energy equation for heat transfer, coupled with enthalpy method to account for phase change in PCM. Systematic parametric studies are performed to understand the effect of mass flow rate, inlet charging system, storage system dimension and encapsulation of the shell diameter on the dynamic behaviour of the storage system. The overall effectiveness and transient temperature difference in HTF temperature in a cycle are computed for different geometrical and operational parameters to evaluate the system performance. It is found that the ability of the latent heat thermal energy storage system to store and release energy is significantly improved by increasing mass flow rate and inlet charging temperature. The transient variation in the HTF temperature can be effectively reduced by decreasing porosity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 118 thermal logs, for a total of 513 temperature measurements in spring 2008 and 585 in autumn 2008, were used to propose the conceptual thermal model of the vertical temperature distribution in the shallow aquifer of the western Po Plain. A constant temperature depth between 30 and 50 m below ground level was observed, under which aquifer temperatures were constant in the range 13 -15 degrees C during the year independent of the external climatic condition. Above the constant temperature depth, the variable temperature zone, where the temperature is strongly influenced by external seasonal variations, was observed. Moreover, the collected thermometric data were processed, and the solution to the heat diffusion equation underground allowed us to determine the average distribution of temperature at different depths over time. This study provides a more detailed conceptual model of the temperature distribution in the Piedmont Po Plain. The model can be applied to other areas with similar hydrogeological characteristics (e.g., the eastern Po Plain or large plain alluvial aquifers).

The conductor resistance was found to have a well-defined average power spectral density over the observed frequency range from 10(-4) to 200 Hz and the dependence of the noise was measured as a function of bias current, temperature, temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), spatial correlation, and state of the surrounding air. In this paper, three different mechanisms were identified that produce the noise. The room-temperature fluctuations were measured and found to have a spectral density nearly proportional to f(-2) over the observed six-order-of-magnitude frequency range. The lowest frequency noise around 10(-4) Hz could be predicted from the measured temperature fluctuations using the TCR; Above 10(-3) Hz and below 1 Hz, enclosing the wire in a box greatly reduces the noise, and placing the wire in a vacuum eliminates the predominant noise. This noise was directly related to the temperature of the conductor, somewhat proportional to the TCR, independent of bias current, and has a correlation length smaller than the specimen size. The highest frequency noise does not depend on the conductor temperature, TCR, or the presence of air. It had a very strong dependence on bias current and had a long spatial correlation.

Initially, the product exhibited low levels of contamination. Microbiological changes during storage depend on the processing (non-pressure and pressure treatment) and the chilled storage conditions. Generally, microbial growth in pressurized samples was similar to that in the non-pressurized samples, although the total viable count and lactic flora were lower and growth was delayed. Processing and storage conditions affected the formation of each amine differently. The most important changes were in tyramine, which formed more quickly in non-pressurized products stored at 12 degrees C and with temperature fluctuations.

Several experimental studies have been performed over different surfaces (pine forest, maize, bare soil) using TIR cameras, either ground based or helicopter borne, designed to evaluate (i) how the spatial resolution operates a smoothing of the temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature measurements from space, and (ii) the resulting uncertainty on these measurements. Additionally, a simulation of instantaneous surface temperatures of a maritime pine stand, performed using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) airflow model coupled with a canopy model, is presented for comparison. The results confirm that the impact of the SBL turbulence rapidly vanishes when spatial resolution decreases (i.e., pixel size increases) in the range of 50 to 100 m, while T-s fluctuations induced by the low frequency PBL turbulence remain. For these resolutions, the resulting uncertainty on T-s lies within a +/- 1 degrees C interval.

Average temperature is the more common climatic variable used in physiological and population studies, and its effect on individual and population-level processes is well understood. However, the intrinsic variability of thermal conditions calls attention to the potential effects that this variability could have in ecological systems. Regarding this point, two hypotheses are proposed. From the allocation principle, it may be inferred that if temperature variability is high enough to induce stress in the organisms, then this extra-cost should reduce the energetic budget for reproduction, which will be reflected in population parameters. Moreover, a mathematical property of non-linear functions, Jensen's inequality, indicates that, in concave functions, like the temperature-reproduction performance function, variability reduces the expected value of the output variable, and again modifies population parameters. To test these hypotheses, experimental cultures of Tribolium confusum under two different thermal variability regimens were carried out. With these data, we fitted a simple population dynamics model to evaluate the predictions of our hypothesis. The results show that thermal variability reduces the maximum reproductive rate of the population but no other parameters such as carrying capacity or the nonlinear factor in a nonlinear version of the Ricker model, which confirms our hypotheses. This result has important consequences, such as the paradoxical increase in population variability under a decrease in thermal variability and the necessary incorporation of climatic variability to evaluate the net effect of climate change on the dynamics of natural populations.",1438-3896,NA,53,1,53-58,NA,NA,NA,1438-390X,NA,J,"Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina/; Estay, Sergio/",42,WOS:000285365800007,1,43,0,40,0,0,NA,"Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Clavijo-Baquet, and Sabrina/0000-0002-9784-9144; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964",Jan-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Beyond Average: An Experimental Test of Temperature Variability on the Population Dynamics of Tribolium Confusum.,selected,NA

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.).

Warming trends of approximately 0.03 degrees C yr(-1) were observed in the upper 2000 m of the water column. A strong annual temperature cycle exists and dominates at the 500 m depth, while signals at the interannual timescales can explain most of the temperature variability at the 1000 m and 1500 m depths. These interannual signals are closely correlated to the variability of deep convection in the Labrador Sea, which has intermittent enhancement of mixed layer depth (MLD) > 1500 m. The Hilbert spectrum from the OHC in the Labrador Sea interior reveals two important components at frequencies of 0.8-1.2 cycle yr(-1) (T=0.8-1.25 years) and 0.1-0.3 cycle yr(-1) (T=3.3-10 years), respectively, superimposed on the warming trends. The former corresponds to the dominant seasonal cycle due to surface heating, while the latter is concomitant with the timing of the reoccurrence of convective events. We also found that the cumulative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index significantly correlates to the low-frequency OHC variations. Therefore, the interannual signals in the Labrador Sea at especially the intermediate layers are attributed to changes in the deep convective processes and the atmospheric conditions. By comparing with an extended OHC record (1945-2010), it was further shown that the warming trends obtained from the 10-year Argo record are part of multi-decadal variations that presumably reflect the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMC). In addition, the recent OHC changes in the Labrador Sea (i.e., increased heat in the deeper layers) may be related to the current global warming hiatus, suggesting the potential contributions from the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to the low-frequency OHC in the Labrador Sea.

The model was developed in two dimensions using the equations of heat, mass, and momentum transport. The governing equations were solved using discretization of the spatial coordinates by orthogonal collocation with Jacobi polynomials and the resulting algebraic system was solved by employing nonlinear relaxation method that uses less computational resources. For the ambient boundary conditions, it was used as a more accurate equation to represent the diurnal-nocturnal temperature dynamic. This study analyzes the effects of moisture migration and temperature interactions between the interstitial air and the sorghum cereal grain bed defined as a porous medium in a cylindrical cavity, including the variations affected by meteorological conditions over 1 year. The mass-thermal gradients were predicted, and the effects of environmental temperature were analyzed for flow patterns, isotherms and moisture distribution changes, indicating how the environmental fluctuations influence the heat and moisture of the ambient spots in the grain storage. The maximum temperature inside the silo was 42 degrees C, considering the respiration heat of the grain, and the maximum temperature of the grain without the climatic boundary conditions was reported to be approximately 35 degrees C in previous studies.

Our results showed the existence of internal tidal bores, characterized by sharp drops in water temperature at the surface and near the bottom, and subsequent temperature increases, which occurred with a semidiurnal periodicity. Measured currents support the hypothesis of alternating onshore and offshore movement of warm-water fronts. The frequency of the events varied through the summer and their amplitude seems to be modulated by onshore winds. The strongest events were observed when strong onshore winds occurred in late afternoon hours and the entire water column showed a semidiurnal temperature signal. Highest values of chlorophyll concentration in the intertidal zone and daily settlement of bivalves, gastropods and crustaceans were observed at times when conditions were favorable for occurrence of internal tidal bores.

To analyze skin blood flow, high-resolution thermometry can be used because low-amplitude skin temperature oscillations are caused by changes in the tone of skin vessels. The aim of our study was to test the possibilities of wavelet analysis of skin temperature (WAST) for the diagnosis of impaired regulation of microvascular tone in patients with type 2 diabetes. A local heating functional test was used for the assessment of microvascular tone regulation. A control group consisted of healthy male and female volunteers (n = 5 each), aged 39.1 +/- 5.3 years. A group of patients with type 2 diabetes comprised thirteen people, seven men and six women, aged 36 to 51 years old (43.2 +/- 3.4 years). The diagnosis of diabetes was made according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). The mean disease duration was 7.36 +/- 0.88 years. Skin temperature oscillations, reflecting intrinsic myogenic activity (0.05-0.14 Hz), neurogenic factors (0.02-0.05 Hz) and endothelial activity (0.0095-0.02 Hz) increase greatly during local heating for healthy subjects. In the group of patients with type 2 diabetes, no statistically significant differences in the amplitudes in the endothelial range were observed. Relative changes in the oscillation amplitudes in patients with type 2 diabetes were markedly lower compared to the control group. The latter indicates that the WAST method enables assessment of the state of vascular tone and the effects of mechanisms responsible for regulation of blood flow in the microvasculature.

Toxicity tests with Myriophyllum spicatum are conducted based on working procedures that provide detailed instructions on how to set up the experiment, e.g., which experimental design is necessary to get reproducible and thus comparable results. Approved working procedures are established by analyzing numerous toxicity tests to find a compromise between practical reasons (e.g., acceptable ranges of ambient conditions as they cannot be kept completely constant) and the ability for detecting growth alterations. However, the benefit of each step of a working procedure, e.g., the random repositioning of test beakers, cannot be exactly quantified, although this information might be useful to evaluate working procedures. In this paper, a growth model of M. spicatum was developed and used to assess the impact of temperature and light fluctuations within the standardized setup. It was analyzed how important it is to randomly reassign the location of each plant during laboratory tests to keep differences between the relative growth rates of individual plants low. Moreover, two examples are presented on how modeling can give insight into toxicity testing.

In such combustors, the challenges of local flow, pressure, chemical composition and thermal signatures as well as their interactions require understanding to seek for optimum performance of the system. The current practice of using a single sensor to measure certain parameters at a single location cannot provide sufficient information to achieve desirable and optimum overall performance of the combustor. A high density sensor network with a large number of sensors will be required in future smart combustors to obtain detailed information on the various ongoing processes within the system. As an initial step towards the development of such sensor networks, the effect of mean and fluctuating temperature distribution on the distribution of acoustic sources within the flame has been examined by using a thermocouple and condenser microphone using swirl stabilized diffusion flames. The measurement of high frequency temperature signal allowed observation of characteristic mean and fluctuating temperatures, and thermal stratification characteristics from within the flame. Specifically mean and fluctuating temperatures, integral and micro-thermal time scales have been determined at various spatial locations in the flame. Investigation of the thermal field and their effect on the localization of acoustic sources in the two flames formed at different equivalence ratios has been examined. The thermal characteristics data obtained provided a better insight on the thermal behavior of co-swirl diffusion flames. Noise spectra for varying air-fuel ratios were determined. Results of time average and fluctuating temperature and sound pressure level spectra showed noise emission in flames to lie near to the regions of high temperature which result in pressure fluctuations within the flame.

Exposure blocks with and without a lichen cover were subjected to short-term temperature fluctuations and two types of moisture events: artificial showers (8 ml rainfall) and larger storms (40 ml rainfall). The experiments showed that larger storms are more likely to dampen temperature fluctuations at the rock surface, especially in the presence of an epilithic lichen cover, providing evidence for a mechanism of bioprotection. The conclusion is that the epilithic lichen retains moisture, which reduces thermal stress in the surface of the limestone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Both collections and images taken along transects document the small-scale abundance patterns of each species with respect to temperature and distance from vent flows. Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus were most abundant at distances from vent flows of 0 to 25 cm in warm fluids with high temperature variability (10 +/- 5 degrees C) over several time scales. Both species were also abundant at 26 to 50 cm, where temperatures were lower with less variability (4 +/- 1 degrees C). Provanna variabilis was most abundant from 51 to 75 cm, where temperatures were stable (3 +/- 0.5 degrees C). All species were absent where maximum fluid temperatures reached 18 degrees C and their substratum coverage was related to temperature. When presented with a choice in vent fluids from 10 to 2 degrees C, L. fucensis and D. globulus moved to areas with temperatures above 5 degrees C, while P. variabilis showed no preference. In species-specific temperature preference experiments, L. fucensis and. D. globulus aggregated between 5 and 1.3 degrees C, while P. variabilis occupied areas with significantly lower temperatures from 4 to 11 degrees C. These experimental temperature preferences correspond with their thermal environments. Upper temperature limits are moderate; extreme abiotic variability in higher temperature fluids may constrain these 3 species.

A new way to use the known method of dipole electromagnetic profiling for the quantitative estimation of the volumetric ice content in frozen soils is discussed. Investigations of foundation of the railroad in Yakutia (i.e. in the permafrost zone) were used as an example for this new approach. Unlike the conventional way, in which the permafrost is investigated by its resistivity and constructing of geo-electrical cross-sections, the new approach is aimed at the study of the dynamics of the process of attenuation in the layer of annual heat cycle in the field of high-frequency vertical magnetic dipole. This task is simplified if not all the characteristics of the polarization ellipse are measured but the only one which is the vertical component of the dipole field and can be the most easily measured. Collected data of the measurements were used to analyze the computational errors of the average values of the volumetric ice content from the amplitude attenuation of the vertical component of the dipole field. Note that the volumetric ice content is very important for construction. It is shown that usually the relative error of computation of this characteristic of a frozen soil does not exceed 20% if the works are performed by the above procedure using the key-site methodology.

However, soil thermal conditions do not necessarily follow synoptic temperature variations. This is because local biogeophysical processes can lead to a pronounced soil-atmosphere thermal offset (Delta T) while altering the coupling (beta Tau) between ST and ambient air temperature (AAT). Here, we aim to uncover the spatiotemporal variation in these parameters and identify their main environmental drivers. By deploying a unique network of 322 temperature loggers and surveying biogeophysical processes across an Arctic landscape, we found that the spatial variation in Delta T during the AAT <= 0 period (mean Delta T = 6.0 degrees C, standard deviation +/- 1.2 degrees C) was directly and indirectly constrained by local topography controlling snow depth. By contrast, during the AAT>0 period, Delta T was controlled by soil characteristics, vegetation and solar radiation (Delta T = -0.6 degrees C +/- 1.0 degrees C). Importantly, Delta T was not constant throughout the seasons reflecting the influence of beta Tau on the rate of local soil warming being stronger after (mean beta Tau = 0.8 +/- 0.1) than before (beta Tau = 0.2 +/- 0.2) snowmelt.

In the past 50 years in arid regions, measured reductions in the daily temperature range of air (DTRair) most likely generated similar reductions in the unmeasured daily temperature range of soil (DTRsoil). However, the role of DTRsoil in regulating microbial and plant processes has not been well described. We experimentally reduced DTRsoil in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park over 3 years. We used shade cloth that effectively decreased DTRsoil by decreasing daily maximum temperature and increasing nighttime minimum temperature. A reduction in DTRsoil generated on average a twofold increase in soil microbial biomass carbon, a 42% increase in soil CO2 efflux and a 16% reduction in soil NO3--N availability; soil available NH4+-N was reduced by 18% in the third year only. Reductions in DTRsoil increased soil moisture up to 15% a few days after a substantial rainfall. Increased soil moisture contributed to higher soil CO2 efflux, but not microbial biomass carbon, which was significantly correlated with DTRsoil. Net photosynthetic rates at saturating light (A(sat)) in Larrea tridentata were not affected by reductions in DTRsoil over the 3 year period. Arid ecosystems may become greater sources of C to the atmosphere with reduced DTRsoil, resulting in a positive feedback to rising global temperatures, if increased C loss is not eventually balanced by increased C uptake.

We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals, PPFD, R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations, appear to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent species diversity.

Luedecke_2011_E.E,"Luedecke, Horst-Joachim",LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTAL AND RECONSTRUCTED TEMPERATURE RECORDS CONTRADICT ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL WARMING,ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT,NA,2011,"This paper analyses the monthly instrumental temperature records from 5 stations in the northern hemisphere, each of which are reliable, local and well over 200 years in length, as well as two reconstructed long-range yearly records from a stalagmite near Innsbruck and from tree rings in the northern hemisphere that are about 2000 years long. In the instrumental records, the steepest fall in 100-year linear regression lines happened in the 19th century and the steepest rise in the 20th century, both events being of about the same magnitude. Evaluation by fluctuation analysis (FA) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed that both the 19th century fall and the 20th century rise have very small natural probabilities and must therefore be trends caused by external forcings. In contrast to this, the reconstructed records show far steeper 100-year rises and falls as quite common during the last 2000 years. Consequently, their DFA evaluation revealed far greater Hurst exponents. These results contradict the hypothesis of an unusual (anthropogenic) global warming during the 20th century. The cause of the different Hurst exponents for the instrumental and the reconstructed temperature records is not known. As a speculative hypothesis, the sun's magnetic field, which is correlated with sunspot numbers, could be put forward as an explanation. The long-term low-frequency fluctuations in sunspot numbers are not detectable by FA/DFA in the monthly instrumental records, resulting in low Hurst exponents. The same does not hold true for the 2000-year-long reconstructed records, which explains both their higher Hurst exponents and the higher probabilities of strong 100-year temperature fluctuations being quite common. A long-term synthetic record that embodies the reconstructed sunspot number fluctuations includes the different Hurst exponents of both the instrumental and the reconstructed records and, therefore, corroborates the conjecture.",0958-305X,NA,22,6,723-745,NA,NA,NA,2048-4070,NA,J,NA,3,WOS:000294789400006,0,3,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Long-Term Instrumental and Reconstructed Temperature Records Contradict Anthropogenic Global Warming.,selected,NA

These statistical relationships can serve as validation targets for global carbon-cycle models. Fourier-transform coherence between atmospheric CO2 measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and Hadley Centre global-average temperatures changed in the late 20th century at interannual frequencies, from a 6-month time lag to a 90 phase lag that scaled CO2 fluctuations to a time-integral of the global-average temperature anomaly. Wavelet coherence estimates argue that this change occurred with a recognized ocean-circulation climate transition during the late 1970s. General features of these CO2-temperature correlations are confirmed using global-average temperature from other sources and atmospheric CO2 measured at other locations, though only the Mauna Loa CO2 record is long enough to resolve well the coherence properties before the 1970s transition. The CO2-coherence phase for the global-average surface-air temperature time series from NASA-GISS and the lower-troposphere temperature series from the MSU satellite is more complex than for the Hadley-Centre dataset, the only estimate that incorporates sea-surface temperature (SST) observations. Near f = 0.25 cyc/year, 4-year oscillation period, the CO2-coherence is particularly strong for the Hadley-Centre gridpoint temperature-anomaly time series from low-latitude oceans. This suggests that sea-surface temperature is a primary driver of the correlation, at least for the 0.2 < f < 0.5 cyc/yr bandpass where the El-Nino/Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) climate process dominates. Outside, the ENSO bandpass coherence is significant between 14 long-running GLOBALVIEW CO2-observing sites and the sea-level-pressure-based Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) time series, consistent with wind stress and mixed-layer-thickness influences on ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux, independent of temperature fluctuations. Evidence for terrestrial biosphere influence is strongest in the leading principal component of GLOBALVIEW CO2-variability at f = 0.25 cpy, where a larger amplitude and a 4-month phase shift distinguish the mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere CO2 fluctuations from those of the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere.

The laboratory experiment included replicated species from Southern, Central, and Northern Europe. Although annual fluctuations in temperature represent a key characteristic of temperate environments, few studies of thermal performance have considered the ecological importance of the studied traits within a seasonal context. Instead, thermal performance is assumed to remain constant throughout ontogeny and to reflect selection acting over the whole life cycle. The laboratory experiment revealed considerable variation among species in the strength and direction of ontogenetic performance shifts. In four species from Southern and Central Europe, reaction norms were steepest during early ontogeny, becoming less steep during later ontogenetic stages (indicative of low-temperature acclimation). In one Northern European species, the slope of reaction norms did not change during ontogeny. In the other North European species, reaction norms became steeper during ontogeny (indicative of high-temperature acclimation). We had expected high-latitude species to show strong low-temperature acclimation responses, because they have a short flight season and inhabit a strongly seasonal environment. Instead, we found the reversed pattern: Low-latitude species displayed strong low-temperature acclimation responses, and high-latitude species displayed weak, or even reversed, acclimation responses to low temperatures. These findings suggest that low-temperature acclimation may be less beneficial and possibly more costly in habitats with rapid seasonal transitions in average temperature. We conclude that thermal performance traits are more dynamic than typically assumed and caution against using results from single ontogenetic stages to predict species' responses to changing environmental conditions.",0012-9615,NA,83,4,491-510,NA,NA,NA,1557-7015,NA,J,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020; Stoks, Robby/",10,WOS:000330526800004,0,10,0,10,0,0,NA,"Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",Nov-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Latitudinal Patterns of Phenology and Age-Specific Thermal Performance Across Six Coenagrion Damselfly Species.,excluded,NA

The formulae of information entropy of activation have been derived for the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model and the activation process model (APM). The physical meaning of this entropy has been determined. It is a measure of conversion of thermal radiation energy to mechanical energy that moves atoms in a molecule during elementary activation act. It is also a measure of uncertainty of this energy conversion. The uncertainty is due to unevenness of distribution function representing the activation process. It has been shown that Arrhenius dependence is caused by the entropy change.

We monitored thermal regimes during the incubation period in 19 natural nests of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern Australia, and experimentally translocated eggs among nests to remove the confounding of ''nest of origin'' (including genetic) factors with incubation conditions. We removed the eggs from the field shortly before hatching, and assessed the hatchlings' phenotypes (body size, shape, locomotor performance). Most of the effects seen after laboratory incubation were also seen after incubation in natural nests. Hatchling phenotypes were affected by incubation conditions as well as by ''nest of origin'' factors and an interaction between the two. Both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures affected hatchling phenotypes, with male and female hatchlings differing in their norms of reaction. We found no evidence that a female's choice of nest site depends on the specific norms of reaction of her own offspring. Overall, incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in hatchling phenotypes as did ''nest-of-origin'' effects.

Theoretical models postulate that thermal specialization should be favored either when little environmental variation is experienced within generations or when among-generation variation is small relative to within-generation variation. To test these predictions, we studied six temperate species of damselflies differing in latitudinal distribution. We developed a computer model simulating how organisms experience environmental variation (accounting for diapause and voltinism) and performed a laboratory experiment assaying thermal sensitivities of growth rates. The computer model showed opposing latitudinal trends in among-and within-generation thermal variability: within-generation thermal variability decreased toward higher latitudes, whereas relative levels of among-generation thermal variability peaked at midlatitudes (where a shift in voltinism occurred). The growth experiment showed that low-latitude species were more thermally generalized than mid- and high-latitude species, supporting the prediction that generalists are favored under high levels of within-generation variation. Northern species had steeper, near-exponential reaction norms suggestive of thermal specialization. However, they had strikingly high thermal optima and grew very slowly over most of the thermal range they are expected to experience in the field. This observation is at present difficult to explain. These results highlight the importance of considering interactions between life history and environmental variation when deriving expectations of thermal adaptation.",0012-9658,NA,93,6,1340-1352,NA,NA,NA,1939-9170,22834375,J,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020; Stoks, Robby/",60,WOS:000305296600012,0,60,0,58,0,0,NA,"Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",Jun-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Generalists and Specialists along a Latitudinal Transect: Patterns of Thermal Adaptation in Six Species of Damselflies.,selected,NA

However, contamination of satellite images can prohibit their use in coastal areas. We compared in situ temperatures to SST foundation (similar to 10 m depth) at 31 sites inshore of the East Australian Current (EAC), the dynamic western boundary current of the south Pacific gyre, using an area averaging approach to overcome coastal contamination. Varying across- and along-shelf distances were used to area average SST measurements and de-correlation time scales were used to gap fill data. As the EAC is typically anisotropic (dominant along-shore flow) the choice of across-shelf distances influenced the correlation with in situ temperatures more than along-shelf distances. However, the ""optimal"" distances for both measurements were within known de-correlation length scales. Incorporating both SST area and time averaging (based on de-correlation time scales) produced data for an average of 96% of days that in situ loggers were deployed, compared to 27% (52%) without (with) area averaging. Temperature differences between the in situ data and SSTs varied depending on time of year, with higher differences in the austral summer when daily in situ temperatures can range by up to 4.20 degrees C. The differences between the in situ and SST measurements were, however, significant with or without area averaging (t-test: p-values < 0.05). Nevertheless, when using the area averaging approaches SSTs were only an average of similar to 1.05 degrees C different from in situ temperatures and less than in situ temperature fluctuations. Linear mixed models revealed that latitude, distance to the coast and nearest estuary did not influence the difference between the in situ and satellite data as much as the water depth. This study shows that using de-correlation length and time scales to inform how to process satellite data can overcome contamination and missing data thereby greatly increasing the coverage and utility of SST data, particularly in coastal areas.",NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2296-7745,NA,J,"Roughan, Moninya/B-5563-2009",5,WOS:000457360600001,0,5,0,4,0,0,261,"Roughan, Moninya/0000-0003-3825-7533",AUG 6 2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Assessing the Use of Area- And Time-Averaging Based on Known De-Correlation Scales to Provide Satellite Derived Sea Surface Temperatures in Coastal Areas.,excluded,NA

It is shown that, under the influence of lift forces on the nonisothermal coolant flow in the upper chamber at the periphery of its bottom region over the side shields, a stable cold coolant isothermal zone is formed, whose dimensions increase with increase of total water flowrate. An essential and stable coolant temperature stratification is detected in the peripheral area of the upper (hot) chamber over the side shields, in the pressure and cold side chambers, in the elevator baffle, in the cooling system of the reactor vessel, and in the outlet of intermediate and autonomous heat exchangers in different operating regimes. Large gradients and temperature fluctuations are registered at the interface of stratified and recycling formations. In all of the studied cooldown versions, the coolant outlet temperature at the core fuel assembly is decreased and the coolant temperature in the peripheral zone of the upper chamber is increased compared to the FC. High performance of a passive emergency cooldown system of a fast reactor (BN-1200) with submersible autonomous heat exchangers (AHE) is confirmed. Thus, in a no-rmal operation regime, even in case of malfunction of three submersible AHEs, the temperature of the equipment inside the reactor remains within acceptable limits and decay heat removal from the reactor does not exceed safe operation limits. The obtained results can be used both for computer code verification and for approximate estimate of the reactor plant parameters on the similarity criteria basis.

Here, we address the question if habitat characteristics describing habitat quality may drive changes in community composition and beta diversity of bromeliad-inhabiting microfauna. In our system, changes in canopy cover along an environmental gradient may affect resource availability, disturbance in form of daily water temperature fluctuations and predation, and thus may lead to changes in community structure of bromeliad microfauna through differences in habitat quality along this gradient. Indeed, we observed distinct changes in microfauna community composition along the environmental gradient explained by changes in the extent of daily water temperature fluctuations. We found beta diversity to be higher under low habitat quality (low canopy cover) than under high habitat quality (high canopy cover), which could potentially be explained by a higher relative importance of stochastic processes under low habitat quality. We also partitioned beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components and we found a nested pattern of beta diversity along the environmental gradient, with communities from the lower-quality habitat being nested subsets of communities from the higher-quality habitat. However, this pattern resulted from an increase in microfauna alpha diversity with an increase in habitat quality. By providing insights into microfauna-environment relationships our results contribute to the mechanistic understanding of community dynamics in small freshwater bodies. Here, we highlight the importance of habitat characteristics representing habitat quality in structuring communities, and suggest that this information may help to improve conservation practices of small freshwater ecosystems.

By performing RNA-sequencing on two Arabidopsis accession and one Brassica species exposed to temperature alterations, we showed that alternative splicing is an important mechanism in ambient temperature sensing and adaptation. We found that amongst the differentially alternatively spliced genes, splicing related genes are enriched, suggesting that the splicing machinery itself is targeted for alternative splicing when temperature changes. Moreover, we showed that many different components of the splicing machinery are targeted for ambient temperature regulated alternative splicing. Mutant analysis of a splicing related gene that was differentially spliced in two of the genotypes showed an altered flowering time response to different temperatures. We propose a two-step mechanism where temperature directly influences alternative splicing of the splicing machinery genes, followed by a second step where the altered splicing machinery affects splicing of downstream genes involved in the adaptation to altered temperatures.

Since all biophysical processes are temperature dependent, this interplay is challenged during temperature fluctuations. How the nervous system remains functional during temperature perturbations remains mostly unknown. We present a hitherto unknown mechanism of how temperature-induced changes in neural networks are compensated by changing their neuromodulatory state: activation of neuromodulatory pathways establishes a dynamic coregulation of synaptic and intrinsic conductances with opposing effects on neuronal activity when temperature changes, hence rescuing neuronal activity. Using the well-studied gastric mill pattern generator of the crab, we show that modest temperature increase can abolish rhythmic activity in isolated neural circuits due to increased leak currents in rhythm-generating neurons. Dynamic clamp-mediated addition of leak currents was sufficient to stop neuronal oscillations at low temperatures, and subtraction of additional leak currents at elevated temperatures was sufficient to rescue the rhythm. Despite the apparent sensitivity of the isolated nervous system to temperature fluctuations, the rhythm could be stabilized by activating extrinsic neuromodulatory inputs from descending projection neurons, a strategy that we indeed found to be implemented in intact animals. In the isolated nervous system, temperature compensation was achieved by stronger extrinsic neuromodulatory input from projection neurons or by augmenting projection neuron influence via bath application of the peptide cotransmitter Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia). CabTRP Ia activates the modulator-induced current IMI (a nonlinear voltage-gated inward current) that effectively acted as a negative leak current and counterbalanced the temperature-induced leak to rescue neuronal oscillations.

Long-term cultivation and breeding have resulted in considerable changes in the number of rose petals, while most wild Rosaceae plants have only one whorl consisting of five petals. The petals of double flowers reportedly originate from stamens, but the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully characterized. In this study, we observed that the number of petals of R. chinensis Old Blush flowers increased and decreased in response to low- and high-temperature treatments, respectively, similar to previous reports. We characterized these variations in further detail and found that the number of stamens exhibited the opposite trend. We cloned an APETALA2 homolog, RcAP2. A detailed analysis of gene structure and promoter cis-acting elements as well as RcAP2 temporospatial expression patterns and responses to temperature changes suggested that RcAP2 expression may be related to the number of petals from stamen origin. The overexpression of RcAP2 in Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants may induce the transformation of stamens to petals, thereby increasing the number of petals. Moreover, silencing RcAP2 in Old Blush plants decreased the number of petals. Our results may be useful for clarifying the temperature-responsive mechanism involved in petaloid stamen production, which may be relevant for the breeding of new rose varieties with enhanced flower traits.

In an example for enteric pathogens, incidence of Escherichia coli O157 (STEC) colonization in cattle is consistently higher during warmer months compared to cooler months in various cattle production systems. However, actual mechanisms for this seasonality remain elusive. In addition, the influence of host (cattle) behavior on this pattern has not been thoroughly considered. To that end, we constructed a spatially explicit agent-based model that accounted for the effect of temperature fluctuations on cattle behavior (direct contact among cattle and indirect between cattle and environment), as well as its effect on pathogen survival in the environment. We then simulated the model in a factorial approach to evaluate the hypothesis that temperature fluctuations can lead to seasonal STEC transmission dynamics by influencing cattle aggregation, grazing, and drinking behaviors. Simulation results showed that higher temperatures increased the frequency at which cattle aggregated under shade in pasture, resulting in increased direct contact and transmission of STEC between individual cattle, and hence higher incidence over model simulations in the warm season. In contrast, increased drinking behavior during warm season was not an important transmission pathway. Although sensitivity analyses suggested that the relative importance of direct vs. indirect (environmental) pathways depend to upon model parameterization, model simulations indicated that factors influencing cattle aggregation, such as temperature, were likely strong drivers of transmission dynamics of enteric pathogens.

However, size and direction of effects for these characteristics varied greatly among studies, also referred to as heterogeneity. Potential sources of heterogeneity have not been investigated in previous meta-analyses, which are explored by correlating additional covariates (moderator variables). We tested whether effect sizes from 34 studies were consistent enough to reject the null hypothesis that trees selected by bats did not significantly differ in their characteristics from randomly selected trees. We also examined whether heterogeneity in tree diameter effect sizes was correlated to moderator variables such as sex, bat species, habitat type, elevation and mean summer temperature.MethodsWe used Hedges&#8217; g standardized mean difference as the effect size for the most common characteristics that were encountered in the literature. We estimated heterogeneity indices, potential publication bias, and spatial autocorrelation of our meta-data. We relied upon meta-regression and multi-model inference approaches to evaluate the effects of moderator variables on heterogeneity in tree diameter effect sizes.ResultsTree diameter, tree height, snag density, elevation, and canopy closure were significant characteristics of roost selection by cavity-roosting bats. Size and direction of effects varied greatly among studies with respect to distance to water, tree density, slope, and bark remaining on trunks. Inclusion of mean summer temperature and sex in meta-regressions further explained heterogeneity in tree diameter effect sizes.ConclusionsRegional differences in roost selection for tree diameter were related to mean summer temperature.

In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14C. Leptodiaptomus garciai is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled L. garciai throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.

Our approach of using a microfluidic valve to regulate the flow into an initially empty cavity allows for on-chip protocol development and refinement. Mixing is provided by way of surface acoustic wave excitation; this high-frequency vibration causes steady-state streaming flows. We show that capacitive sensing can be used to measure fluid levels, even if multiple fluid types are used, such that nanoliter dispensing accuracy is achieved. Also, the capacitive readout can be used to establish mixing quality and to monitor temperature fluctuations.

This study developed a comprehensive thermal management strategy to improve the operational reliability of a small-scale wind power converter. Firstly, the idea of thermal management that improves the reliability is introduced. Then, in order to smooth the temperature fluctuations, the adjustment law of the switching frequency and the strategy of the exterior thermal management have been investigated. A field-programmable gate array- based thermal management system consists of temperature-controlled oscillator and fan speed regulator as well as power resistor heating system was designed. Lastly, numerical simulation and experimental implementation were carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed thermal smooth control method.",1755-4535,NA,9,3,393-400,NA,NA,NA,1755-4543,NA,J,NA,4,WOS:000372357400001,2,6,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,MAR 9 2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Smooth Control of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors Junction Temperature in a Small-Scale Wind Power Converter.,excluded,NA

One key temperature-dependent virulence trait of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is its ability to transition from yeast to filamentous growth, which is induced by environmental cues at host physiological temperature. A key regulator of temperature-dependent morphogenesis is the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which has complex functional relationships with the transcription factor Hsf1. Although Hsf1 controls global transcriptional remodeling in response to heat shock, its impact on morphogenesis remains unknown. Here, we establish an intriguing paradigm whereby overexpression or depletion of C. albicans HSF1 induces morphogenesis in the absence of external cues. HSF1 depletion compromises Hsp90 function, thereby driving filamentation. HSF1 overexpression does not impact Hsp90 function, but rather induces a dose-dependent expansion of Hsf1 direct targets that drives overexpression of positive regulators of filamentation, including Brg1 and Ume6, thereby bypassing the requirement for elevated temperature during morphogenesis. This work provides new insight into Hsf1-mediated environmentally contingent transcriptional control, implicates Hsf1 in regulation of a key virulence trait, and highlights fascinating biology whereby either overexpression or depletion of a single cellular regulator induces a profound developmental transition.
