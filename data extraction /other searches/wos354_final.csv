While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the development of more accurate thermal performance models.",The Ghost of Temperature Past: Interactive Effects of Previous and Current Thermal Conditions on Gene Expression in Manduca Sexta.,selected,NA,selected

We studied the temperature fluctuations in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands, which account for as much as 65% of the total variance. We analyzed data from 25 moorings along the mainland and the Northern Channel Islands deployed at depths 8-18 m during 1999-2012. In the diurnal band, the temperature fluctuations vary almost simultaneously within two distinct regions, with a lag of 5 h between the regions: the mainland east of Point Conception and the west part of the Channel exposed to the large-scale winds. The two regions of in-phase temperature variability are in agreement with a previously published division of zones according to the wind characteristics. The portion of the diurnal temperature variance that is wind driven does not propagate along the coastline, but rather is directly forced by the wind. The semidiurnal temperature oscillations are more substantial in the Northern Channel Islands. These findings are consistent with a numerical study that predicted that the steep slopes of the Santa Cruz Basin, located south of the Channel Islands, are a source of semidiurnal internal tides. We conclude that the contrast between the spatial patterns of the diurnal and semidiurnal temperature oscillations on scales of tens of kilometers reflects the spatial distribution of the main forcing in each band, namely the diurnal wind and the locally generated semidiurnal internal tide. The spatial patterns of the diurnal and semidiurnal oscillations reflect the forcing in each band.","Contrasting Spatial Patterns in the Diurnal and Semidiurnal Temperature Variability in the Santa Barbara Channel, California.",selected,background paper ,selected

The cause of this intermittency is not well understood. We studied the effects of the barotropic tide, vertical stratification, propagation of coastal-trapped waves, regional wind relaxations, and diurnal-band winds on the intermittency of the temperature fluctuations during 1992-2015. We used temperature data from 43 moorings in 10-200 m water depth and wind data from two buoys and one land station. Subtidal-frequency changes in vertical stratification explain 20-40% of the intermittency in diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations at time scales of days to weeks. Along the mainland north of Point Conception and at the Northern Channel Islands, the relaxation of upwelling-favorable winds substantially increases vertical stratification, accounting for up to 55% of the subtidal-frequency variability in stratification. As a result of the enhanced stratification, wind relaxations enhance the diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations at those sites, even though the diurnal-band wind forcing decreases during wind relaxation. A linear model where the background stratification is advected vertically explains a substantial fraction of the temperature fluctuations at most sites. The increase of vertical stratification and subsequent increase in diurnal and semidiurnal temperature fluctuations during wind relaxation is a mechanism that can supply nutrients to the euphotic zone and kelp forests in the Channel in summer when upwelling is weak.","Effects of the Relaxation of Upwelling-Favorable Winds on the Diurnal and Semidiurnal Water Temperature Fluctuations in the Santa Barbara Channel, California.",selected,background,selected

Hourly measurements of the near-bottom water temperature were collected off the Swakopmund Jetty to investigate the thermal variability in relation to local winds. The thermal regime of this coastal region appears to be controlled by the locally forced Ekman offshore transport. Related changes in offshore transport led those of the surf-zone temperature by about one day. A transfer of kinetic energy from the alongshore wind into the temperature field of the nearshore zone dominated relative short time scales (hourly). The longer periods (7-9 days) are associated with the forcing of poleward-directed continental shelf waves. The origin of the 24-25 day frequencies is not clearly understood. However, it characterises the nearshore wind field as well as the water temperature of the surf zone. These relatively long quasi-cycles could originate from rhythmic changes in the regional wind field as a result of changes in the thermal contrast between sea and land areas.","Short-Term Variability in Alongshore Winds and Temperature Off Swakopmund, Namibia, During a Non-Upwelling Event in 1998-1999.",selected,this would be good background for case studies that talk about the importance of different period of enviornmental variability.,selected

Both collections and images taken along transects document the small-scale abundance patterns of each species with respect to temperature and distance from vent flows. Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus were most abundant at distances from vent flows of 0 to 25 cm in warm fluids with high temperature variability (10 +/- 5 degrees C) over several time scales. Both species were also abundant at 26 to 50 cm, where temperatures were lower with less variability (4 +/- 1 degrees C). Provanna variabilis was most abundant from 51 to 75 cm, where temperatures were stable (3 +/- 0.5 degrees C). All species were absent where maximum fluid temperatures reached 18 degrees C and their substratum coverage was related to temperature. When presented with a choice in vent fluids from 10 to 2 degrees C, L. fucensis and D. globulus moved to areas with temperatures above 5 degrees C, while P. variabilis showed no preference. In species-specific temperature preference experiments, L. fucensis and. D. globulus aggregated between 5 and 1.3 degrees C, while P. variabilis occupied areas with significantly lower temperatures from 4 to 11 degrees C. These experimental temperature preferences correspond with their thermal environments. Upper temperature limits are moderate; extreme abiotic variability in higher temperature fluids may constrain these 3 species. We conclude thermal conditions are a primary determinant of habitat selection, thereby driving gastropod abundance patterns. However, other factors likely contribute.

While this species has been a model organism for understanding physiological adaptations to extreme environments, lacking are corroborative in situ experiments and characterization of temperature-related behaviors representing the lower thermal tolerance range of this species. To address this knowledge gap, we first quantified the upper thermal limit for this species using a rapid heating protocol executed remotely on the seafloor. Second, we used a combination of in situ observations and shipboard experiments to test for temperature-dependent patterns in activity and behavior. We confirm that P. sulfincola is remarkably eurythermal and demonstrates a thermal niche breadth exceeding 45 degrees C. We further show that the activity and positioning of worms relate to temperatures within its lower preferred range (i.e., between 4 and 20 degrees C). Worms tended to remain closer to their tube openings and held their branchial crown in a consistent location when fluids were relatively warm. By contrast, when fluids were cooler, both the distance worms were observed from their tubes and positioning of their branchial crown were more variable. A Bayesian hidden Markov model classified each worm at each time interval as being in a high or low activity state according to the magnitude of change in their orientation and how far they moved between successive time lapse images. We found that the transition between active and inactive states at any time period is related to fluid temperature. Our observations indicate that the behavior of the worms is temperature-dependent, which may in turn reflect temperature-related variables such as the delivery of food particles, dissolved oxygen concentration, or relative environmental variability. Our findings demonstrate that this species can respond behaviorally to very fine-scale environmental variability in a manner not simply predicted by models of increasing activity with temperature.

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures.

With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton species in naturally variable thermal environments.

Freshwater turtles have long been used to characterize the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying TSD and provide a great system to investigate how changing climatic conditions will affect vertebrates with TSD. Unfortunately, most of what we know about the mechanisms underlying TSD comes from laboratory conditions that do not accurately mimic natural conditions (i.e., constant incubation temperatures and supraphysiological steroid manipulations). In this paper, we review recent advances in our understanding of how TSD operates in nature that arose from studies using more natural fluctuating incubation temperatures and natural variation in maternal estrogens within the yolk. By incorporating more natural conditions into laboratory studies, we are better able to use these studies to predict how changing climatic conditions will affect species with TSD.",Temperature Fluctuations and Maternal Estrogens as Critical Factors for Understanding Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination in Nature.,selected,background ,selected

Results: Maximum resting metabolism and metabolic breadth were significantly different, but optimal temperature was similar, between treatments. Thus, increases in ambient thermal variability caused a reduction in maximum performance at each level of acclimation, with a decrease of almost 50% between the nil variability and +/- 8 degrees C daily variability treatments.

Woodlice (the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis) exhibit a readily observed behaviour that may reflect their acclimation capacities. When they find themselves on their back, they sometimes roll over (i.e. right themselves). Whether they do, and how fast they do it, are measures of their behaviour and performance that vary with ambient temperature. Goal: Measure experimentally the effect of acclimation to environmental thermal variability on the rollover behaviour of Porcellio laevis. Methods: Maintain woodlice in 24 degrees C laboratory environments. Each individual lived in one of three thermal treatments: constant temperature regime (delta = 0); a regime with alternating temperatures of 27 degrees C during daytime and 21 degrees C at night (delta = 3); and a regime with alternating temperatures of 32 degrees C during daytime and 16 degrees C at night (delta = 8). After 3 months, measure the rollover behaviour (percentage that rolled over) and rollover speed of the woodlice at 5, 15, 25, 32, and 38 degrees C. Rollover speed is the inverse of the time it took an individual to right itself. Results: At 5 and 38 degrees C, most woodlice seemed to be in thermal coma and had very slow rollover speed. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, rollover speed was in the range 0.12-0.18 rollovers per second. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, 52% of individuals righted themselves in similar to 4 s. At these temperatures, most individuals either rolled quickly or remained inactive for the entire 10-min test period. When we examined rollover speed in the cooler (night) and warmer (daytime) periods, individuals subjected to the three regimes of temperature variation differed: woodlice acclimated to delta = 8 roll over very fast when temperature (T) is low and very slowly when T is high; woodlice acclimated to delta = 3 roll over fairly fast when T is low and somewhat slowly when T is high; and woodlice acclimated to delta = 0 roll over quite quickly when T is low and quite slowly when T is high. However, the higher and lower speeds at different regimes neutralized each other so that average rollover speed over the course of a whole day did not depend on the size of the daily fluctuation. Conclusions: The impact of temperature variability must be taken into consideration. Behavioural responses that are seemingly costly in the very short term may be beneficial in the longer term.","Temperature Variability and Thermal Performance in Ectotherms: Acclimation, Behaviour, and Experimental Considerations.",selected,NA,selected

To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinas virginianus] and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.",Avian Parental Behavior and Nest Success Influenced by Temperature Fluctuations.,selected,NA,selected

Fourth generation eggs were acclimated to different thermal fluctuation cycles until hatching occurred.

We studied within-generation plasticity and transgenerational effects of thermal conditions on temperature tolerance and demographic parameters inDrosophila melanogaster. We employed a fully factorial design, in which both parental (P) and offspring generations (F1) were reared in a constant or a variable thermal environment. Thermal variability during ontogeny increased heat tolerance in P, but with demographic cost as this treatment resulted in substantially lower survival, fecundity, and net reproductive rate. The adverse effects of thermal variability (V) on demographic parameters were less drastic in flies from the F1, which exhibited higher net reproductive rates than their parents. These compensatory responses could not totally overcome the challenges of the thermally variable regime, contrasting with the offspring of flies raised in a constant temperature (C) that showed no reduction in fitness with thermal variation. Thus, the parental thermal environment had effects on thermal tolerance and demographic parameters in fruit fly.

High-frequency temperature fluctuations caused no deviations from typical coevolutionary arms race dynamics. However, coevolution was stalled during periods of high temperature under intermediate-and low-frequency fluctuations, generating temporary coevolutionary cold spots. Temperature variation affected population density, providing evidence that eco-evolutionary feedbacks act through variable bacteria-phage encounter rates.

Average temperature is the more common climatic variable used in physiological and population studies, and its effect on individual and population-level processes is well understood. However, the intrinsic variability of thermal conditions calls attention to the potential effects that this variability could have in ecological systems. Regarding this point, two hypotheses are proposed. From the allocation principle, it may be inferred that if temperature variability is high enough to induce stress in the organisms, then this extra-cost should reduce the energetic budget for reproduction, which will be reflected in population parameters. Moreover, a mathematical property of non-linear functions, Jensen's inequality, indicates that, in concave functions, like the temperature-reproduction performance function, variability reduces the expected value of the output variable, and again modifies population parameters. To test these hypotheses, experimental cultures of Tribolium confusum under two different thermal variability regimens were carried out. With these data, we fitted a simple population dynamics model to evaluate the predictions of our hypothesis. The results show that thermal variability reduces the maximum reproductive rate of the population but no other parameters such as carrying capacity or the nonlinear factor in a nonlinear version of the Ricker model, which confirms our hypotheses.

In treatment 2 (T2), temperature swing was 5 degrees C (mild) which had a total variation of 10 degrees C (Tvar-10) with a minimum of 15 degrees C and maximum of 25 C, treatment 3 (T3) had a variation about the mean of 10 degrees C (moderate) with a total variation of 20 degrees C (Tvar-20) with a minimum of 10 degrees C and maximum of 30 degrees C, or 15 degrees C (severe) swings about the mean in treatment 4 (T4) with a diurnal total variation of 30 C (Tvar-30) with a minimum of 5 C and maximum of 35 C. Leaf area and shoot dry weight of plants in the severe treatment were 30% lower than Controls. Root dry weight in the severe treatment was 30% lower than in the mild treatment. Fruits in the moderate and severe treatments were 22% smaller than in the mild treatment. Fruit soluble sugar content was elevated slightly by RZT fluctuation. Shoot concentrations of N, Mg, Fe, B, Zn were not affected by RZT, but there were small differences in concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mn, and Cu. Nutrient uptake of N and Ca were not affected, but P, K and Mg were about 35% less in Tvar-20 and Tvar-30. RZT variation had no effect on chlorophyll content or number of leaves, maximum carboxylation rate, photosynthetic electron transport rate, maximum CO2 assimilation rate, or fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm and OPSII). There was little effect of RZT on predawn or midday stem water potential (SWP), but the SWP was substantially lowered in the severe treatment at mid -morning when RZT was about 5 C and air vapor pressure deficit was at its daily maximum. We attributed the reduced shoot and root growth to the transient reduction in SWP when RZT was near 5 C. Overall, the consequences of diurnal RZT fluctuations for strawberry production appear to be small if the minimum temperature is above 7 C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A major unresolved question is how such sensitivity to environmental factors may determine population structure. Extending a hypothesis first advanced by Forsythe (1993, in: Recent Advances in Fisheries Biology (T. Okutani, R. K. O'Dor, & T. Kubdera, eds.), Tokyo, Tokai University Press), we formulate a simple individual-level model which incorporates a two-stage growth response for squid hatchlings exposed to continuous seasonal fluctuations of temperature. We show that in seasonally fluctuating temperatures such a growth 'duality' can directly affect the size distribution of squid over the year and we demonstrate how in seasonally warming waters this mechanism may lead to younger individuals surpassing the size of older individuals. By postulating that development status can be inferred directly from size, we go on to propose a circle-map model of the whole squid life cycle. Numerical investigations into the iterative dynamics support the hypothesis that the progeny from such a population can rapidly separate to a low number of tightly synchronized cohorts within a few generations.",How Seasonal Temperature Variations may Influence the Structure of Annual Squid Populations.,selected,NA,selected

Toxicity tests with Myriophyllum spicatum are conducted based on working procedures that provide detailed instructions on how to set up the experiment, e.g., which experimental design is necessary to get reproducible and thus comparable results. Approved working procedures are established by analyzing numerous toxicity tests to find a compromise between practical reasons (e.g., acceptable ranges of ambient conditions as they cannot be kept completely constant) and the ability for detecting growth alterations. However, the benefit of each step of a working procedure, e.g., the random repositioning of test beakers, cannot be exactly quantified, although this information might be useful to evaluate working procedures. In this paper, a growth model of M. spicatum was developed and used to assess the impact of temperature and light fluctuations within the standardized setup. It was analyzed how important it is to randomly reassign the location of each plant during laboratory tests to keep differences between the relative growth rates of individual plants low. Moreover, two examples are presented on how modeling can give insight into toxicity testing. Results showed that randomly repositioning of individual plants during an experiment can compensate for fluctuations of light and temperature.

Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis, is influenced by water temperature fluctuations caused by the Northern Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass. Here, the effects of acute seawater temperature change, gradual temperature change, and fluctuating temperature on the physiological and enzymatic activities in Yesso scallop were studied. Scallops were transferred directly from rearing temperature (15 degrees C) to 5, 10, or 20 degrees C for the acute water temperature change treatment. Scallops in the gradual water temperature change treatment were acclimated to different temperatures (5, 10, and 20 degrees C) by increasing or decreasing seawater temperature progressively (1-2 degrees C/day). The results showed that oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion rates in the 20 degrees C-acute water temperature change treatment were significantly higher than those in the gradual treatment (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). However, scallop ingestion rate decreased significantly in response to an acute water temperature decrease from 15 to 5 degrees C, compared with equivalent groups exposed to a gradual temperature drop (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). Moreover, hepatopancreatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), acid phosphatase (ACP), and lysozyme (LSZ) activities reached their highest levels in the 20 degrees C-acute treatment after 12 h. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased significantly following the acute water temperature changes and reached the highest level in 10 degrees C-acute treatment after 72 h. Heat shock protein70 gene (Hsp70) expression levels also increased significantly when water temperature was increased rapidly from 15 to 20 degrees C or decreased rapidly from 15 to 10 degrees C (P < 0.01).

Warming trends of approximately 0.03 degrees C yr(-1) were observed in the upper 2000 m of the water column. A strong annual temperature cycle exists and dominates at the 500 m depth, while signals at the interannual timescales can explain most of the temperature variability at the 1000 m and 1500 m depths. These interannual signals are closely correlated to the variability of deep convection in the Labrador Sea, which has intermittent enhancement of mixed layer depth (MLD) > 1500 m. The Hilbert spectrum from the OHC in the Labrador Sea interior reveals two important components at frequencies of 0.8-1.2 cycle yr(-1) (T=0.8-1.25 years) and 0.1-0.3 cycle yr(-1) (T=3.3-10 years), respectively, superimposed on the warming trends. The former corresponds to the dominant seasonal cycle due to surface heating, while the latter is concomitant with the timing of the reoccurrence of convective events. We also found that the cumulative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index significantly correlates to the low-frequency OHC variations. Therefore, the interannual signals in the Labrador Sea at especially the intermediate layers are attributed to changes in the deep convective processes and the atmospheric conditions. By comparing with an extended OHC record (1945-2010), it was further shown that the warming trends obtained from the 10-year Argo record are part of multi-decadal variations that presumably reflect the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMC). In addition, the recent OHC changes in the Labrador Sea (i.e., increased heat in the deeper layers) may be related to the current global warming hiatus, suggesting the potential contributions from the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to the low-frequency OHC in the Labrador Sea.

In the instrumental records, the steepest fall in 100-year linear regression lines happened in the 19th century and the steepest rise in the 20th century, both events being of about the same magnitude. Evaluation by fluctuation analysis (FA) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed that both the 19th century fall and the 20th century rise have very small natural probabilities and must therefore be trends caused by external forcings. In contrast to this, the reconstructed records show far steeper 100-year rises and falls as quite common during the last 2000 years. Consequently, their DFA evaluation revealed far greater Hurst exponents. These results contradict the hypothesis of an unusual (anthropogenic) global warming during the 20th century. The cause of the different Hurst exponents for the instrumental and the reconstructed temperature records is not known. As a speculative hypothesis, the sun's magnetic field, which is correlated with sunspot numbers, could be put forward as an explanation. The long-term low-frequency fluctuations in sunspot numbers are not detectable by FA/DFA in the monthly instrumental records, resulting in low Hurst exponents. The same does not hold true for the 2000-year-long reconstructed records, which explains both their higher Hurst exponents and the higher probabilities of strong 100-year temperature fluctuations being quite common.

Theoretical models postulate that thermal specialization should be favored either when little environmental variation is experienced within generations or when among-generation variation is small relative to within-generation variation. To test these predictions, we studied six temperate species of damselflies differing in latitudinal distribution. We developed a computer model simulating how organisms experience environmental variation (accounting for diapause and voltinism) and performed a laboratory experiment assaying thermal sensitivities of growth rates. The computer model showed opposing latitudinal trends in among-and within-generation thermal variability: within-generation thermal variability decreased toward higher latitudes, whereas relative levels of among-generation thermal variability peaked at midlatitudes (where a shift in voltinism occurred). The growth experiment showed that low-latitude species were more thermally generalized than mid- and high-latitude species, supporting the prediction that generalists are favored under high levels of within-generation variation. Northern species had steeper, near-exponential reaction norms suggestive of thermal specialization. However, they had strikingly high thermal optima and grew very slowly over most of the thermal range they are expected to experience in the field. This observation is at present difficult to explain.

In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14C. Leptodiaptomus garciai is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled L. garciai throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index.

The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.

To gain a better understanding of the daily temperature dynamics of malaria mosquito breeding sites and of the relationships between meteorological variables and water temperature, three clear water pools (diameter x depth: 0.16 x 0.04, 0.32 x 0.16 and 0-96 x 0.32 in) were created in Kenya. Continuous water temperature measurements at various depths were combined with weather data collections from a meteorological station. The water pools were homothermic, but the top water layer differed by up to about 2 degrees C in temperature, depending on weather conditions. Although the daily mean temperature of all water pools was similar (27.4-28.1 degrees C) the average recorded difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperature was 14.4 degrees C in the smallest versus 7.1 degrees C in the largest water pool. Average water temperature corresponded well with various meteorological variables. The temperature of each water pool was continuously higher than the air temperature. A model was developed that predicts the diurnal water temperature dynamics accurately, based on the estimated energy budget components of these water pools. The air-water interface appeared the most important boundary for energy exchange processes and on average 82-89% of the total energy was gained and lost at this boundary. Besides energy loss to longwave radiation, loss due to evaporation was high; the average estimated daily evaporation ranged from 4.2 mm in the smallest to 3.7 mm in the largest water pool.

Their fitness, measured by intrinsic growth rate and net reproductive rate, is partially driven by biochemical processes. Thus, it is a function of ambient temperature. Biochemical processes may not be approximated well by yearly mean temperature alone when temperature cycles yearly, largely. Higher order moments may also be important. The amplitude of yearly fluctuations of monthly and seasonal sea temperatures varies dramatically across the northern temperate regions. Thus, they can impact the fitness, thereby the colonization potential of copepods migrating across such region. To investigate this, we derive approximate metrics of periodic (yearly) fitness: the yearly intrinsic growth rate, and a weighted net reproductive rate. We use them to measure the persistence and the growth of an Allee-effect free, stage-structured, fast-maturing, small population of invasive copepods that reproduces year-round in habitats with yearly temperature cycles. We show that the yearly fitness increases substantially when a population is introduced from a habitat with large amplitude to that with small amplitude yearly fluctuating temperatures, given that their mean temperatures and other environmental and ecological factors are constant. The detected range-expansion of the modeled species matches the potential fitness gradient predicted by the metrics. The study leads to the question whether the gradient of the amplitudes of temperature between habitats with similar yearly mean temperatures impacts a class of fast-maturating calanoid copepods, colonizing new habitats, and becoming invasive.",Temperature Cycles Affect Colonization Potential of Calanoid Copepods.,selected,NA,selected

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.).

I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 degreesC, a constant 12 degreesC, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 degreesC. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 degreesC consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 degreesC individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 degreesC tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 degreesC. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 degreesC had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 degreesC tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 degreesC, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species.

Although climate models predict increases in both temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C) fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins.

(V) over dot o(2) was temperature-independent, with temperature quotients (Q(10)) values <= 1 in all populations, indicative of metabolic compensation.

Mussels from treatment (i) that had not released glochidia during the experiment did so soon after being moved to the temperature in (ii), indicating a temperature threshold for glochidia release. Neither host fish presence nor the combined effect of temperature and host fish presence significantly affected the timing of glochidia release.

Experiments were conducted on recently matured seeds at 22 degrees C mean temperature with fluctuation amplitudes of 0 degrees-16 degrees C, and at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean temperature) in light and darkness before and after a cold-wet stratification. At 22 degrees C mean temperature, seed germination increased in almost all investigated species with increasing temperature amplitudes, in both light and darkness. The average germination percentage across all species was 29.4% in light and 5.1% in darkness. The averaged amplitude required to reach 50% of maximum germination was 9.8 degrees C. Species with little sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in light showed a clear sensitivity in darkness. The germination percentage was 4.0% for species with seed weights >0.9 mg and 23% for species with seed weights <0.9 mg. By means of a principal component analysis the investigated species could be divided into three groups: (1) species with considerable germination at constant temperature, (2) species with a high germination percentage in response to strong fluctuations but no germination at the constant temperature and at low amplitudes and (3) species which did not germinate at all or showed a low degree of germination at high amplitudes in light. The germination percentage of recently matured seeds was generally lower at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean) than at 28/16 degrees C (22 degrees C mean). Cold-wet stratification enhanced germination at 22/10 degrees C in 33 species in light, and in 26 species strict dark dormancy was relieved. Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, a need for relatively high temperature fluctuations to trigger germination and reach 50% of maximum germination and prolonged lag-phases of non-stratified seeds were common features of almost all investigated sedges and might favour the built-up of persistent seed banks. The capacity to respond to fluctuating temperatures in particular provides a mechanism favouring spring germination. Sedges occurring in dry or mesic habitats showed a lower sensitivity to alternating temperatures than sedges of wet habitats. In contrast to forest species of other taxa, forest sedges were highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, thereby restricting their germination to vegetation gaps. The variation in response to fluctuating temperatures and stratification in general were relatively small in the investigated Carer species, thus suggesting that their germination behaviour was determined not only by habitat conditions.",Germination Responses of Temperate Carex-Species to Diurnally Fluctuating Temperatures - a Comparative Study.,selected,NA,selected

We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals, PPFD, R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations, appear to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent species diversity.

We monitored thermal regimes during the incubation period in 19 natural nests of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern Australia, and experimentally translocated eggs among nests to remove the confounding of ''nest of origin'' (including genetic) factors with incubation conditions. We removed the eggs from the field shortly before hatching, and assessed the hatchlings' phenotypes (body size, shape, locomotor performance). Most of the effects seen after laboratory incubation were also seen after incubation in natural nests. Hatchling phenotypes were affected by incubation conditions as well as by ''nest of origin'' factors and an interaction between the two. Both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures affected hatchling phenotypes, with male and female hatchlings differing in their norms of reaction. We found no evidence that a female's choice of nest site depends on the specific norms of reaction of her own offspring. Overall, incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in hatchling phenotypes as did ''nest-of-origin'' effects.

Our investigations focused on the relationship between temperature, plant composition and abundance, and woodrat size. Body size was estimated by measuring fossil fecal pellets, a technique validated in earlier work. We found significant and highly covariable patterns in body mass over the five locations, suggesting that responses to temperature fluctuations during the late Quaternary have been very similar. Although woodrat mass and the occurrence of several plant species in the fossil record were significantly correlated, in virtually all instances changes in woodrat size preceded changes in vegetational composition. These results may be due to the greater sensitivity of woodrats to temperature, or to the shorter generation times of woodrats as compared to most plants. An alternative hypothesis is that winter temperatures increased before summer ones. Woodrats are highly sensitive to warmer winters, whereas little response would be expected from forest/woodland plants growing at their lower limits. Our work suggests that woodrat size is a precise paleothermometer, yielding information about temperature variation over relatively short-term temporal and regional scales.

The aim of this work was to analyze the temperature profile in the soil, on surfaces with vegetated and nonvegetated soil, checking the average hourly variation of soil temperature at different depths and comparing the soil temperature profiles. The hourly data of soil temperature were measured and collected during the period of 23 at 25 June of 2015, in the experimental site Modesto Rodrigues, in the locality of Cuiarana, Salinopolis-PA. The soil temperature increases from 6h to approximately 14h, and decreases from that time. The highest temperatures occur in non-vegetated soil and the lower temperatures in the vegetated soil, due to the presence of higher humidity in vegetated soil. In the analysis of results, the conclusion is that soil temperature was directly related to solar radiation exposure time, being this kind of information, essential in understanding agro-meteorological and micrometeorological studies.","Hourly Variability of Soil Temperature Profile in an Orchard of Mango Trees (Mangifera Indica L.) in the Location of Cuiarana, Salinopolis - Pa.",selected,background???,selected

LBFs inhabit a broad range of shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species, to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration, mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site. In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A. lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A. lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra- and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.",Variable Thermal Stress Tolerance of the Reef-Associated Symbiont-Bearing Foraminifera Amphistegina Linked to Differences in Symbiont Type.,selected,NA,selected

The optimal water temperature for embryonic development of this population is 21 degrees C However, in some cases, the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.

In the course of the experiment, microcosms were periodically removed, and the body weight and gut content weight, offspring production and mortality of the earthworm were estimated. Under constant temperature conditions, the fresh body weight of worms quickly diminished. This correlated with a drastic increase in the death rate, and also with a high cocoon production. On the contrary, under a fluctuating temperature regime 5-25 degrees C, the earthworms were characterized by a moderate loss of body weight, higher survival and reduced fertility. Reactions in the regime of 10-20 degrees C were intermediate.

In the past 50 years in arid regions, measured reductions in the daily temperature range of air (DTRair) most likely generated similar reductions in the unmeasured daily temperature range of soil (DTRsoil). However, the role of DTRsoil in regulating microbial and plant processes has not been well described. We experimentally reduced DTRsoil in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park over 3 years. We used shade cloth that effectively decreased DTRsoil by decreasing daily maximum temperature and increasing nighttime minimum temperature. A reduction in DTRsoil generated on average a twofold increase in soil microbial biomass carbon, a 42% increase in soil CO2 efflux and a 16% reduction in soil NO3--N availability; soil available NH4+-N was reduced by 18% in the third year only. Reductions in DTRsoil increased soil moisture up to 15% a few days after a substantial rainfall. Increased soil moisture contributed to higher soil CO2 efflux, but not microbial biomass carbon, which was significantly correlated with DTRsoil. Net photosynthetic rates at saturating light (A(sat)) in Larrea tridentata were not affected by reductions in DTRsoil over the 3 year period. Arid ecosystems may become greater sources of C to the atmosphere with reduced DTRsoil, resulting in a positive feedback to rising global temperatures, if increased C loss is not eventually balanced by increased C uptake. Ultimately, ecosystem models of N and C fluxes will need to account for these temperature-driven processes.",Reductions in Daily Soil Temperature Variability Increase Soil Microbial Biomass c and Decrease Soil n Availability in the Chihuahuan Desert: Potential Implications for Ecosystem c and n Fluxes.,selected,observational study ,selected

In a time in which temperatures are rising world-wide, the mechanism by which plants are able to sense temperature fluctuations and adapt to it, is becoming of special interest. By performing RNA-sequencing on two Arabidopsis accession and one Brassica species exposed to temperature alterations, we showed that alternative splicing is an important mechanism in ambient temperature sensing and adaptation. We found that amongst the differentially alternatively spliced genes, splicing related genes are enriched, suggesting that the splicing machinery itself is targeted for alternative splicing when temperature changes. Moreover, we showed that many different components of the splicing machinery are targeted for ambient temperature regulated alternative splicing. Mutant analysis of a splicing related gene that was differentially spliced in two of the genotypes showed an altered flowering time response to different temperatures. We propose a two-step mechanism where temperature directly influences alternative splicing of the splicing machinery genes, followed by a second step where the altered splicing machinery affects splicing of downstream genes involved in the adaptation to altered temperatures.

Study revealed that after 15 days, the highest growth rate of G. asiatica was recorded at 20 degrees C under low initial nutrient concentration whiles the lowest was recorded at 25 degrees C under high initial nutrient concentration. The NO3-N uptake rate of G. asiatica under low and high initial concentration at temperatures 20 degrees C and 20 +/- 2 degrees C were higher than other conditions after 15 days. On the other hand the PO3-P uptake rate under high initial concentration at temperatures 20 degrees C and 20 +/- 2 degrees C were lower than other conditions after 15 days. After the third day, NO3-N and PO4-P were exhausted from the medium when the initial concentration were low under different temperature fluctuations. Photosynthetic efficiency observed at temperatures 15 degrees C and 15 +/- 2 degrees C decreased from beginning whiles the photosynthetic efficiency at 25 degrees C and 25 +/- 2 degrees C increased from beginning.

One is L-2 from directed horizontal visibility graph and the other is L-1 from consecutive increasing and decreasing steps. The results show that there are differential TA features among daily temperature fluctuations. Firstly, there are marked differences in TA strengths among different temperature variables. It is found that dominated uniformly significant TA (larger than the threshold from corresponding surrogates) emerges in almost all observed T-mean fluctuations. However, this kind of uniformly significant TA can't be found in T-max, T-min and DTR for both observed and reanalysis data sets. Since both TA measures L-1 and L-2 quantify the temporal structures in the given series, this distinguishable TA strengths found in different temperature variables indicates that there are distinct temporal structures in the different temperature variables' variations. Secondly, the TA in each temperature variable is region dependent. The TA strength for each temperature variable is spatially non-uniform with some strong and weak TA regional patterns and these strong and weak TA regional patterns may depend on local weather or climate conditions. Moreover, comparison studies of the same temperature variable reveal that time irreversible features are distinguishable between observations and reanalysis, and this differential feature can be taken as an index to evaluate the quality of reanalysis.",Differential Temporal Asymmetry among Different Temperature Variables' Daily Fluctuations.,selected,background?,selected

When eggs of ectotherms are exposed to large temperature fluctuations, egg phenotypes and post-hatching traits may be altered, but little relevant information is available on insects. Hence, we simulated a set of natural diurnal temperature fluctuations each with the same mean temperature (25 +/- 0, 25 +/- 2, 25 +/- 4, 25 +/- 6, 25 +/- 8, 25 +/- 10 degrees C), to which we exposed the eggs of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and assessed subsequent egg development, survival and post-hatching traits. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in these phenomena between the constant temperature treatment and the treatments with moderate temperature fluctuations. However, large temperature fluctuations slowed development and lowered hatching rate during the egg stage. In addition the effects of these large temperature fluctuations extended to the larval stage, but not to the pupal and adult stages. No apparent costs of compensatory responses, which occurred in the larval stage, were detected in the later stages. These findings indicate that fluctuating temperature effects are potentially important in predicting insect phenology and population dynamics. As an independent factor, the effects of temperature fluctuations on a stage in the life history must be factored into models for predicting insect development that are based on mean temperatures. The larger of the temperature fluctuations to which eggs of diamondback moth were exposed, affected development time, hatching rate, larval growth and pre-pupal mass.",Effects of Large Temperature Fluctuations on Hatching and Subsequent Development of the Diamondback Moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae),selected,NA,selected
