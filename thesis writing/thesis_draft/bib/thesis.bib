	abstract = {In many animals, temperatures experienced by developing embryos determine offspring sex (e.g. temperature-dependent sex determination, {TSD}), but most studies focus strictly on the effects of mean temperature, with little emphasis on the importance of thermal fluctuations. In the jacky dragon (
              Amphibolurus muricatus
              ), an Australian lizard with {TSD}, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that {TSD} can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of {TSD} reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of {TSD}, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Climate warming is predicted to cause large-scale extinctions, particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer to the temperature at which ﬁtness is maximized (Topt) and an upper temperature limit for survival (Tmax) that is closer to Topt than do temperate species. Thus, even a small increase in environmental temperature could put tropical ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework to partition the temperature response of ﬁtness into its components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test model predictions with data for insects. We ﬁnd that ﬁtness declines at high temperatures because the temperature responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways: fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase. The proximity of Topt to Tmax depends on how the temperature response of development mediates the interaction between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which causes ﬁtness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures exceed Topt. The model correctly predicts empirically observed ﬁtness-temperature relationships in insects from different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the latitudinal differences in ﬁtness responses.},

Freshwater turtles have long been used to characterize the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying {TSD} and provide a great system to investigate how changing climatic conditions will affect vertebrates with {TSD}. Unfortunately, most of what we know about the mechanisms underlying {TSD} comes from laboratory conditions that do not accurately mimic natural conditions (i.e., constant incubation temperatures and supraphysiological steroid manipulations). In this paper, we review recent advances in our understanding of how {TSD} operates in nature that arose from studies using more natural fluctuating incubation temperatures and natural variation in maternal estrogens within the yolk. By incorporating more natural conditions into laboratory studies, we are better able to use these studies to predict how changing climatic conditions will affect species with {TSD}.},

	abstract = {Insects exposed to low temperature often have high mortality or exhibit sublethal effects. A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, {FTR}). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of {FTR} on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various ‘-omics’ techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to {FTR} and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a systemwide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under {FTR}. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of {FTR}, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. {FTR} can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of {FTR} techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints. {FTR} definitively enhances survival at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of {FTR} must be explored more thoroughly. Although {FTR} is not ecologically relevant, similar processes may operate in settings where temperatures fluctuate naturally.},

	abstract = {Temperature variation within a year can impact biological processes driving population abundances. The implications for the ecosystem services these populations provide, including food production from marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures. Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields, but current levels of functional diversity ({FD}) of targeted species, measured using traits related to species' responses to temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high {FD} of catch could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8\% relative to projections if {FD} were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast, species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, but that {FD} can buffer these negative impacts.},

Methods are needed to predict how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates. Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental variance remains constant, omitting it from population models compromises their ability to predict species’ responses to changes in mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses to the environment, we outline how species’ traits such as phylogenetic history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global change under future environmental variability.},

	abstract = {Seed dormancy and size are two important life-­history traits that interplay as adaptation to varying environmental settings. As evolution of both traits involves correlated selective pressures, it is of interest to comparatively investigate the evolution of the two traits jointly as well as independently. We explore evolutionary trajectories of seed dormancy and size using adaptive dynamics in scenarios of deterministic or stochastic temperature variations. Ecological dynamics usually result in unbalanced population structures, and temperature shifts or fluctuations of high magnitude give rise to more balanced ecological structures. When only seed dormancy evolves, it is counter-­ selected and temperature shifts hasten this evolution. Evolution of seed size results in the fixation of a given strategy and evolved seed size decreases when seed dormancy is lowered. When coevolution is allowed, evolutionary variations are reduced while the speed of evolution becomes faster given temperature shifts. Such coevolution scenarios systematically result in reduced seed dormancy and size and similar unbalanced population structures. We discuss how this may be linked to the system stability. Dormancy is counter-­selected because population dynamics lead to stable equilibrium, while small seeds are selected as the outcome of size-­number trade-­offs. Our results suggest that unlike random temperature variation between generations, temperature shifts with high magnitude can considerably alter population structures and accelerate life-­history evolution. This study increases our understanding of plant evolution and persistence in the context of climate changes.},

Here, we highlight how temperature ﬂuctuation can generate ‘realized’ thermal reaction (ﬁtness) norms that differ from the ‘fundamental’ norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we ﬁnd that temperature ﬂuctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily ﬂuctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing ‘thermal safety margins’. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature.},

Equally, all protagonists agree that thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in development. Based on an array of other fitness-enhancing behaviors exhibited by tetrapod embryos, and general principles for recognizing adaptation, we conclude that behavioral thermoregulation inside the egg likely is adaptive in some but not all reptile species.

	title = {Impact of daily variable temperatures in life-history traits of tropical anurans},
	volume = {65},
	abstract = {Anuran embryos and tadpoles are daily exposed to wide thermal variations in their ponds, with maximum temperatures at midday. The aim of this research was to study the impact of three daily variable thermal environments (with maximum experimental temperatures between 10:00 and 16:00 hours), on the survival, developmental time and body size of metamorphs of four tropical anuran species from lowland habitats in Colombia. A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5 °C; maximum temperature = 34 ± 1 °C; range = 23-35 °C), medium temperature (25.5 °C; 29 ± 1 °C; 23-30 °C), and low temperature (24 °C; 24 ± 1 °C; 23-25 °C). For the other species, Espadarana prosoblepon, 40 embryos to metamorphosis were exposed to each one of the following thermal treatments: high temperature (mean = 22 °C; maximum temperature = 25 ± 1 °C; range = 18-26 °C), medium temperature (20.5 °C; 22 ± 1 °C; 18-23 °C), and low temperature (19 °C; 19 ± 1 °C; 18-20 °C). For all species, the thermal variable environment with the highest temperature showed the greatest accumulated survival, reduced significantly the developmental time from embryos to metamorphs, and the snout-vent-length of metamorphs. Therefore, under field conditions where ponds are exposed to thermally variable environments, the highest temperatures may promote a decrease in the period of time to metamorphosis, and a positive increase for the anuran survival; nevertheless, extreme temperatures were also found in the microhabitat of the species studied, higher than their upper thermal limits reported, which suggest a vulnerable situation for them and other tropical anurans from similar habitats.

	abstract = {Phalaenopsis orchids are among the most valuable potted ﬂowering crops commercially produced throughout the world because of their long ﬂower life and ease of crop scheduling to meet speciﬁc market dates. During commercial production, Phalaenopsis are usually grown at an air temperature {\textgreater}28 °C to inhibit ﬂower initiation, and a cooler night than day temperature regimen (e.g. 25/20 °C day/night) is used to induce ﬂowering. However, the speciﬁc effect of day and night temperature on ﬂower initiation has not been well described, and the reported requirement for a diurnal temperature ﬂuctuation to elicit ﬂowering is unclear. Two Phalaenopsis clones were grown in glass greenhouse compartments with constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, or 29 °C and ﬂuctuating day/night (12 h/12 h) temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/17, or 29/23 °C. The photoperiod was 12 h, and the maximum irradiance was controlled to {\textless}150 mmol {mÀ}2 {sÀ}1. After 20 weeks, {\textgreater}80\% of plants of both clones had a visible inﬂorescence when grown at constant 14, 17, 20, or 23 °C and at ﬂuctuating day/night temperatures of 20/14 °C or 23/17 °C. None of the plants were reproductive within 20 weeks when grown at a constant 29 °C or at 29/17 °C or 29/23 °C day/night temperature regimens. The number of inﬂorescences per plant and the number of ﬂower buds on the ﬁrst inﬂorescence were greatest when the average daily temperature was 14 °C or 17 °C. These results indicate that a day/night ﬂuctuation in temperature is not required for inﬂorescence initiation in these two Phalaenopsis clones. Furthermore, the inhibition of ﬂowering when the day temperature was 29 °C and the night temperature was 17 °C or 23 °C suggests that a warm day temperature inhibits ﬂower initiation in Phalaenopsis.},

This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental components of the substantial among-population variation in growth rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet, frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures (20{ЊC} and 25{ЊC}) were chosen to mirror ﬁeld differences in nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to affect ﬁrst-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that these differences reﬂect adaptation to local habitats at a very small geographic scale. In addition, signiﬁcant directional selection for large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These results are considered in the context of population colonization history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate variation.},

Although Drosophila melanogaster develops smaller cells at ﬂuctuating temperatures, we do not know whether this response depends on the frequency or amplitude of thermal change. In a laboratory experiment, we exposed ﬂies to either frequent or infrequent ﬂuctuations between 17 and 27 °C, while controlling the total exposure to each temperature. Flies emerged from these treatments with similar body sizes, but ﬂies at more frequent ﬂuctuations emerged earlier and had smaller epidermal cells for a given body size. Tissue built from small cells has more nuclei for transcription, shorter distances between cell compartments, and a larger surface area for transport across membranes. Therefore, we hypothesize that physiological effects of small cells reduce lags in metabolic activity and enhance performance of ﬂies during warming. For plasticity of cell size to confer a ﬁtness advantage, this hypothetical beneﬁt must outweigh the cost of maintaining a greater area of plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {Costs of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments have often been studied in morphological structures. Such structures typically are irreversible for at least some stage in the organism’s life. In this study we investigated whether recurrent and reversible adaptation to changes in the thermal environment incurs a cost in terms of some key life-history traits in the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We exposed juvenile O. cincta to two treatments differing in the frequency of temperature ﬂuctuation but with equal total temperature sums. In the high frequency treatment temperature ﬂuctuated daily between 10 and 20 1C, while in the low frequency treatment temperature ﬂuctuated on a weekly schedule. During the treatments we measured juvenile growth rate and juvenile mortality, and after six weeks the animals were transferred to constant 15 1C and adult starvation resistance was assessed. We found no signiﬁcant differences between the treatments in juvenile growth rate or juvenile survival. Also, adults that had grown up under high frequency temperature ﬂuctuations did not suffer from reduced starvation resistance compared to animals growing under low frequency temperature ﬂuctuations. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis that selection minimizes the production costs of inducible phenotypes and suggests that the development of optimal phenotypes and evolution of temperature reaction norms are not constrained by such costs.},

Migration behavior is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light, predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difﬁcult to determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically signiﬁcant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations; (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia vertical migration; and (3) deﬁning how two anthropogenic stressors (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior.},

However, little is known about the physiology of high night temperature ({HNT}) effects and natural variation in {HNT} susceptibility. Twelve rice cultivars were investigated under {HNT} (30 C day/28 C night) and control (28 C day/21 C night) conditions. Chlorosis was observed under {HNT} and used to classify relative sensitivity of cultivars. The resulting mean sensitivity rank correlated signiﬁcantly with seed yield under {HNT} (r = –0.547). Wide variability in {HNT} tolerance led to an increase in shoot {FW} and {DW} in tolerant, but decreased plant growth in sensitive cultivars. Growth parameters correlated negatively with {HNT} sensitivity. Respiration rate was signiﬁcantly increased under {HNT} at the end of night for several cultivars 34 {DAS} and 41 {DAS} and for all cultivars 66 {DAS} whereas photosynthetic quantum yield was not inﬂuenced. Negative correlations of sensitivity rank with respiration rate at two time points under {HNT} (r = –0.305; r = –0.265) exclude higher respiration rates in sensitive cultivars as a primary cause for {HNT} sensitivity. Monosaccharide and starch concentrations of leaves were increased after 16 days of {HNT}, while sucrose was not affected. Additionally tolerant cultivars showed a higher increase of monosaccharide concentrations during the day under {HNT} compared with control conditions. While {HNT} did not lead to carbon depletion in rice leaves, tolerant cultivars coped better with {HNT}, enabling them to accumulate more carbohydrates than sensitive cultivars with leaves affected by chlorosis.},

Diel metabolite profiles were largely captured in sinusoidal simulations at similar {DLI} in controlled environment chambers, except that amino acids were lower in natural light regimes. We now extend the {DLI}12 study by investigating metabolism in a natural light regime with variable temperature including cool nights.

Connectivity in central metabolism, which decreased in variable light, was r not further weakened by variable temperature.

We also compared transcript abundance of s ten circadian clock genes in this temperature-variable regime with the temperature-controlled u natural and sinusoidal light regimes.

	abstract = {Daily thermal fluctuations ({DTF}) impact the capacity of ectotherms to maintain performance and energetic demands due to thermodynamic effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms which reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of {DTF}. Species which experience varying degrees of {DTF} in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to {DTF} tadpoles from habitats characterised by small {DTF} would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large {DTF}. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species which differ naturally in their exposure to {DTF} raised in control (24°C) and {DTF} treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). {DTF} reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing {DTF} was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although {DTF} induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. {DTF} increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.891.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will likely be most affected.},

	abstract = {Genetic prerequisites for the evolution of sexual dimorphism, sex-speciﬁc heritabilities and low or negative genetic correlations between homologous traits in males and females are rarely found. However, sexual dimorphism is evolving rapidly following environmental change, suggesting that sexual dimorphism and its genetic background could be environmentally sensitive. Yet few studies have explored the sensitivity of the genetic background of sexual dimorphism on environmental variation. In this study, on Drosophila melanogaster, we used a large nested full-sib–half-sib breeding design where families were split into four different developmental temperatures: two constant temperature treatments of 25 and 30 °C and two cycling temperatures with means of 25 and 30 °C, respectively. After emergence, we tested heat shock tolerance of adult ﬂies. We found that sexual dimorphism was strongly affected by temperature during development. Moreover, we found that female heritability was signiﬁcantly lower in ﬂies developing at hot temperature and more so under hot and cycling temperatures. Interestingly, most of the genetic variation for heat shock tolerance was orthogonal (i.e. noncorrelated) between sexes, allowing independent evolution of heat shock tolerance in males and females. These ﬁndings give support to the hypothesis that the evolution of sexual dimorphism can be inﬂuenced by the environments experienced during development.},

	abstract = {Social insects depend on their nests for protection against predation and abiotic threats. Accordingly, the chemical compounds present in the material wasps use to build their nests can both facilitate communication and repel predators. It is herein hypothesized that diﬀerent wasp species build their nests with diﬀerent structure and substrate materials and that such materials consist of chemical compounds related to unique wasp behavior and outside temperature variation. To test this hypothesis, nests were collected from three species of social wasps, the samples of which were subjected to temperature variation under laboratory conditions. The compounds present in the substrate were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Chemical compounds identiﬁed in the nest material of the three species responded diﬀerently to temperature variation. Chemical compounds from Polybia nests were altered signiﬁcantly when subjected to temperature variation, whereas the nests of Polistes versicolor did not signiﬁcantly change in relation to the control. The diﬀerences found between Polistes and Polybia nests may be related to genetic factors, but also to the type of nest they construct. It is possible that divergent evolutionary strategies for maintaining colony temperature, as a function of the chemical composition of the nests, may have appeared between wasps that have open and closed nests. In relatively small colonies, nest substrate is more resistant to temperature variation because it is composed of a greater diversity of elements and thus capable of holding heavier, longer carbon chains. Our results suggest that chemical compounds in the nest material of the three wasp species analysed responded diﬀerently to ﬂuctuating ambient temperatures and that such variation could result from the biochemical diﬀerences of unique wasp species or from thermoregulation strategies of colonies.},

The water temperature under ﬁeld conditions was 11.07 0.3 °C (Czarci Jar Fish Farm) and 13.2 71.4 °C (Janowo Fish Farm). The study showed that artiﬁcial reproduction of dace is possible in all the temperature ranges under study and an embryo survival rate of over 87\% can be achieved. Dace has also been found to be very sensitive to rapid temperature changes, even within the temperature ranges optimal for the species. Such changes have an adverse effect on the outcome of the reproduction process, such as a decrease in the percentage of reproducing females, a decrease in the pseudo-gonado-somatic index ({PGSI}) and a decrease in the embryo survival rate.},

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events, including heat waves ({HWs}) and severe storms, influence the structure of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite growing consensus that anthropogenic climate change will increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of extreme events, current understanding of their impact on communities and ecosystems is limited. Here, we used sessile invertebrates on settlement panels as model assemblages to examine the influence of {HW} magnitude, duration and timing on marine biodiversity patterns. Settlement panels were deployed in a marina in southwest {UK} for ≥5 weeks, to allow sufficient time for colonisation and development of sessile fauna, before being subjected to simulated {HWs} in a mesocosm facility. Replicate panel assemblages were held at ambient sea temperature (∼17 ◦C), or +3 ◦C or +5 ◦C for a period of 1 or 2 weeks, before being returned to the marina for a recovery phase of 2–3 weeks. The 10-week experiment was repeated 3 times, staggered throughout summer, to examine the influence of {HW} timing on community impacts. Contrary to our expectations, the warming events had no clear, consistent impacts on the abundance of species or the structure of sessile assemblages. With the exception of 1 high-magnitude long-duration {HW} event, warming did not alter not assemblage structure, favour non-native species, nor lead to changes in richness, abundance or biomass of sessile faunal assemblages. The observed lack of effect may have been caused by a combination of (1) the use of relatively low magnitude, realistic heat wave treatments compared to previous studies (2), the greater resilience of mature adult sessile fauna compared to recruits and juveniles, and (3) the high thermal tolerance of the model organisms (i.e., temperate fouling species, principally bryozoans and ascidians). Our study demonstrates the importance of using realistic treatments when manipulating climate change variables, and also suggests that biogeographical context may influence community-level responses to short-term warming events, which are predicted to increase in severity in the future.},

The biology and ecological parameters of C. multicicatrices were investigated using as a host plant Caesalpinia pluviosa var. peltophoroides (Fabaceae) under two environmental conditions: semifield (max temp., 31.5 ± 3.0°C; max. {RH}, 78.9 ± 6.0\%) and a glass house (max. temp., 37.1 ± 5.1°C, max. {RH}, 67.0 ± 6.2\%) in the premises of Corpoica, Palmira Research Station. The duration of the different developmental stages was highly different under both temperature conditions. First- and third-instar nymphs, the period of ovisac growth of the adult, and the duration of the life cycle were significantly higher in the semifield conditions compared to the glass house conditions. In contrast, the second-instar nymph stage was shorter in the semifield conditions. The duration of the fourth-instar stage (adult) and the reproductive period were the same in both environments. As for the evaluated ecological parameters, a great difference was found between the two environmental conditions, where the net reproductive rate (Ro) and mean generation time (T) were significantly higher in the semifield conditions than in the glass house conditions. The obtained biological and ecological information is an essential tool for finding strategies to control this insect pest. This is the first detailed study on the biology of a species in the genus Crypticerya Cockerell.},

Herein we studied the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuating temperatures on biological parameters of V. canescens. Parasitized ﬁfth-instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were reared individually in incubators at six ﬂuctuating temperature regimes (15–19.5 °C with a mean of 17.6 °C, 17.5–22.5 °C with a mean of 19.8 °C, 20–30 °C with a mean of 22.7 °C, 22.5–27.5 °C with a mean of 25 °C, 25.5-32.5 °C with a mean of 28.3 °C and 28.5–33 °C with a mean of 30 °C) until emergence and death of V. canescens adults. Developmental time from parasitism to adult eclosion, adult longevity and survival were recorded at each ﬂuctuating temperature regime. In principle, developmental time decreased with an increase of the mean temperature of the ﬂuctuating temperature regime. Upper and lower threshold temperatures for total development were estimated at 34.9 and 6.7 °C, respectively. Optimum temperature for development and thermal constant were 28.6 °C and 526.3 degree days, respectively. Adult longevity was also affected by ﬂuctuating temperature, as it was signiﬁcantly reduced at the highest mean temperature (7.0 days at 30 °C) compared to the lowest one (29.4 days at 17.6 °C). Survival was low at all tested ﬂuctuating temperatures, apart from mean ﬂuctuating temperature of 25 °C (37\%). Understanding the thermal biology of V. canescens under more natural conditions is of critical importance in applied contexts. Thus, predictions of biological responses to ﬂuctuating temperatures may be used in population forecasting models which potentially inﬂuence decision-making in {IPM} programs.},

The optimal water temperature for embryonic development of this population is 21 1C. However, in some cases, the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artiﬁcial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal ﬂuctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 1C) and semi-lethal (23 1C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artiﬁcially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.},

In this study, field-collected specimens of Ae. japonicus and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) (Linnaeus) from Zürich (Switzerland) were orally exposed to two strains ({NY}99 and {FIN}) of the avian zoonotic pathogen West Nile virus ({WNV}) (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus). Dissemination and transmission of the viruses after incubation for 12–15 days under a fluctuating Central European midsummer temperature regime (24 ± 7 ∘C) was investigated by detection of viral {RNA} in homogenates of pools of both head/thorax and saliva by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}). Culex pipiens was susceptible to {WNV} {NY}99 only, whereas both virus strains could be detected in Ae. japonicus, with the additional isolation of {WNV} {NY}99 in Vero cell culture from one saliva pool. Given the high abundances of Ae. japonicus in many newly colonized areas, its recently demonstrated broad host range, including mammalian and avian blood hosts, and its vector competence, this species is a potential key bridge vector of {WNV} in Central Europe.},

In addition, survival of 3rd and 5th instar larvae and pupae increased under the conditions of thermoperiod (5:15 °C) and thermoperiod (5:15 °C) + {RCH}, possibly due to the induction of heat shock proteins or cryoprotectants. However, the pre-treatments of thermoperiod + {RCH} + {RHH} and thermoperiod + {RHH} + {RCH} did not signiﬁcantly enhance survival of any developmental stage.

The beneﬁcial effects of {FTR} result from physiological repair during warming intervals. The duration and the temperature experienced during the recovery period are supposed to strongly impact the resulting cold survival; however, disentangling the effects of both recovery variables had not been broadly investigated. In this study, we investigate cold tolerance (lethal time, Lt50) of the polyphagous beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. We examined adult survival under various {CLTs} (0, 5, 10 and 15 1C), and under 20 different {FTR} conditions, where the 0 1C exposure alternated with various recovery temperatures (Rt) (5, 10, 15 and 20 1C) combined with various recovery durations (Rds) (0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h). Under {CLTs}, Lt50 increased with temperature until no mortality occurred above the upper limit of cold injury zone ({ULCIZ}). Under {FTRs}, Lt50 increased with both Rt and Rd. The magnitude of the survival gain was clearly boosted when Rt was above the {ULCIZ} (at 20 1C). Based on a data matrix of lethal times with multiple Rt Â Rd combinations, a predictive model showed that cold survival increased exponentially with Rt and Rd. This model was subsequently validated with additional survival tests. We suggest that increasing recovery durations associated with optimal recovery temperatures eventually leads to a progressive chilling compensation.},

	abstract = {Drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest causing severe damages to a large panel of cultivated crops. To facilitate its biocontrol with strategies such as sterile or incompatible insect techniques, D. suzukii must be mass-produced and then stored and transported under low temperature. Prolonged cold exposure induces chill injuries that can be mitigated if the cold period is interrupted with short warming intervals, referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes ({FTR}). In this study, we tested how to optimally use {FTR} to extend the shelf life of D. suzukii under cold storage. Several {FTR} parameters were assessed: temperature (15, 20, 25 °C), duration (0.5, 1, 2, 3 h), and frequency (every 12, 24, 36, 48 h) of warming intervals, in two wild-type lines and in two developmental stages (pupae and adults). Generally, {FTR} improved cold storage tolerance with respect to constant low temperatures ({CLT}). Cold mortality was lower when recovery temperature was 20 °C or higher, when duration was 2 h per day or longer, and when warming interruptions occurred frequently (every 12 or 24 h). Applying an optimized {FTR} protocol to adults greatly reduced cold mortality over long-term storage (up to 130 d). Consequences of {FTR} on fitness-related traits were also investigated. For adults, poststorage survival was unaffected by {FTR}, as was the case for female fecundity and male mating capacity. On the other hand, when cold storage occurred at pupal stage, poststorage survival and male mating capacity were altered under {CLT}, but not under {FTR}. After storage of pupae, female fecundity was lower under {FTR} compared to {CLT}, suggesting an energy trade-off between repair of chill damages and egg production. This study provides detailed information on the application and optimization of an {FTRbased} protocol for cold storage of D. suzukii that could be useful for the biocontrol of this pest.},

Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but ﬂuctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and ⁄ or ﬂuctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a splitbrood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when ﬂuctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after ﬂuctuating selection. Our results suggest that ﬂuctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneﬁcial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental ﬂuctuations. Our study highlights that environmental ﬂuctuations should be considered when investigating the response of a population to environmental change.},

We 31 reared ﬂies under common conditions (long days, 21 °C; control) and induced plasticity by rapid cold- 32 hardening ({RCH}, 1 h at 0 °C followed by 1 h recovery), cold acclimation ({CA}, 5 days at 6 °C) or acclimation 33 under ﬂuctuating temperatures ({FA}). D. suzukii had supercooling points ({SCPs}) between À16 and À23 °C, 34 and were chill-susceptible. 80\% of control ﬂies were killed after 1 h at À7.2 °C (males) or À7.5 °C 35 (females); {CA} and {FA} improved survival of this temperature in both sexes, but {RCH} did not. 80\% of control 36 ﬂies were killed after 70 h (male) or 92 h (female) at 0 °C, and {FA} shifted this to 112 h (males) and 165 h 37 (females). {FA} ﬂies entered chill coma ({CTmin}) at approximately À1.7 °C, which was ca. 0.5 °C colder than 38 control ﬂies; {RCH} and {CA} increased the {CTmin} compared to controls.

This study aims at testing the survival of Drosophila melanogaster under constant low temperatures ({CLTs}) (2, 3, 4, and 5°C) vs. ﬂuctuating thermal regimes ({FTRs}). In the latter, the cold stress period was interrupted daily by 2 h pulses at 20°C. Since acclimation enhances cold tolerance, we tested whether beneﬁts of acclimation can combine with those of {FTRs}. Since D. melanogaster overwinters as non-reproductive adults, we tested if actively reproducing adults are more susceptible to cold stress than virgin females that have a much reduced reproductive activity. The results show that short interruptions of cold stress enhanced survival of adult ﬂies. Survival was time- and temperature-dependent. Prior acclimation to low temperature allowed ﬂies to better cope with cold stress under {CLTs}. On the other hand, acclimated ﬂies did not proﬁt from the beneﬁts of {FTRs} and even showed lower survival under {FTRs}, probably because ﬂies deacclimated during the periodic warm intervals. Gravid females were overall less cold tolerant than virgin females, and both survived better under {FTRs}. Cold survival at pupal stage was much lower than at adult stage, and no clear beneﬁt of {FTR} was observed in this life stage.

Mechanisms which reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of {DTF}. Species which experience varying degrees of {DTF} in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to {DTF} tadpoles from habitats characterised by small {DTF} would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large {DTF}. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species which differ naturally in their exposure to {DTF} raised in control (24°C) and {DTF} treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). {DTF} reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing {DTF} was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although {DTF} induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. {DTF} increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.891.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will likely be most affected.},

	abstract = {The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation’s exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably ﬂuctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong inﬂuence of both temperature ﬂuctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for ﬂies developed in both types of ﬂuctuating thermal environments compared with ﬂies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneﬁcial hardening when developing in either ﬂuctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, ﬂies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to ﬂies from the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably ﬂuctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of ﬂies in the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.},

Fluctuating culture temperatures can affect fungal yields and fungal tolerance to desiccation, {UV} radiation, H2O2, and heat stress, as well as antioxidase expression. To explore these effects, E. vermicola cultured under five temperature ranges, 26°C, 15–26°C, 26–35°C, 20–30°C, and 15–35°C, were compared. The cultures grown at lower temperatures showed better growth, stronger tolerance to desiccation, {UV}, and H2O2 stresses, and increased catalase expression, However, these cultures also showed weaker heat stress tolerance and lower superoxide dismutase expression than the higher-temperature cultures. In particular, the E. vermicola cultured at 20–30°C, i.e., fluctuating in a narrow range around the optimal temperature, showed the best performance. Therefore, for production in practical applications, this narrowly fluctuating, moderate temperature appears to be optimal for yield and stress tolerance in E. vermicola.},

Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature eﬀects under more natural ﬂuctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian ﬂuctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 °C and 25 °C did not diﬀer from the rates measured at ﬂuctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the diﬀerence between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 °C being greater than that measured at the ﬂuctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime eﬀects on rattlesnakes’ metabolism is dependent on temperature range. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multi-factorial attributes of temperature variation in the exam of its eﬀects over functional traits. Such approach provides a more solid support for inferences about temperature eﬀects on the life history, ecology and conservation of ectothermic organisms.},

Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but ﬂuctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and ⁄ or ﬂuctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a splitbrood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when ﬂuctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after ﬂuctuating selection. Our results suggest that ﬂuctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneﬁcial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental ﬂuctuations. Our study highlights that environmental ﬂuctuations should be considered when investigating the response of a population to environmental change.},

Theory suggests that effects should vary with temperature, being especially pronounced at more extreme low (because of thermal respite) and high (because of Jensen’s inequality) tem­ peratures. Here we tested this idea by examining the effects of constant temperatures (10 to 30 ◦C in 5 ◦C in­ crements) and fluctuating temperatures (means equal to the constant temperatures, but with fluctuations of ±5 ◦C) temperatures on the adult (F2) phenotypic plasticity of three thermal performance traits – critical thermal minimum ({CTmin}), critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}), and upper lethal temperature ({ULT}50) in ten species of springtails (Collembola) from three families (Isotomidae 7 spp.; Entomobryidae 2 spp.; Onychiuridae 1 sp.). The lowest mean {CTmin} value recorded here was -3.56 ± 1.0 ◦C for Paristoma notabilis and the highest mean {CTmax} was 43.1 ± 0.8 ◦C for Hemisotoma thermophila. The Acclimation Response Ratio for {CTmin} was on average 0.12 ◦C/◦C (range: 0.04 to 0.21 ◦C/◦C), but was much lower for {CTmax} (mean: 0.017 ◦C/◦C, range: -0.015 to 0.047 ◦C/◦C) and lower also for {ULT}50 (mean: 0.05 ◦C/◦C, range: -0.007 to 0.14 ◦C/◦C). Fluctuating versus constant tem­ peratures typically had little effect on adult phenotypic plasticity, with effect sizes either no different from zero, or inconsistent in the direction of difference. Previous work assessing adult phenotypic plasticity of these thermal performance traits across a range of constant temperatures can thus be applied to a broader range of circum­ stances in springtails.},

	abstract = {Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short- and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability ({\textgreater}20°C) and can be exposed to high levels of {UV}-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low {UV}-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24°C) or fluctuating temperatures (18–32°C) under high or low {UV}-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing {UV}-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and {UV}-B exposure. Temperature treatment and {UV}-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.},

	abstract = {Temperature and ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and {UVR} can cause cellular damage that result in the upregulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of {UVR} exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and {UVR} on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18 °C, constant 28 °C and daily ﬂuctuations between 18 and 28 °C) in the presence or absence of {UVR}. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits ({CTmax}), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that {CTmax} was inﬂuenced by an interactive effect between temperature and {UVR} treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to {UVR} led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing {CTmax}. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difﬁculty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation.},

Mechanisms which reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of {DTF}.

We tested the hypothesis that in response to {DTF} tadpoles from habitats characterised by small {DTF} would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large {DTF}. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species which differ naturally in their exposure to {DTF} raised in control (24°C) and {DTF} treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). {DTF} reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing {DTF} was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although {DTF} induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. {DTF} increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.891.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will likely be most affected.},

Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation’s exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably ﬂuctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong inﬂuence of both temperature ﬂuctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for ﬂies developed in both types of ﬂuctuating thermal environments compared with ﬂies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneﬁcial hardening when developing in either ﬂuctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, ﬂies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to ﬂies from the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably ﬂuctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of ﬂies in the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.},

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 ± 0.5 °C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13–17 °C day−1 or widely variable 11–21 °C day−1) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 ± 0.5 °C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, \% body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, {CTMax}) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) were assessed in ﬁsh from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in ﬁsh maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No signiﬁcant variation in {CTMax} was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where Ucrit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum Ucrit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at diﬀerent test temperatures (stable: 4.62 ± 0.44 {BL} s−1 at 15 °C; narrowly variable: 4.52 ± 0.23 {BL} s−1 at 21 °C; widely variable: 3.90 ± 0.24 {BL} s−1 at 11 °C, mean ± s.e.m.).

To assess the overwintering ability of B. latifrons adults, survival at constant temperatures (8, 10, 12, 14, 15 °C) and under ﬂuctuating thermal regimes ({FTRs}) was investigated. At 14 or 15 °C, more than 30 \% of females survived for 90 days.

The results show that females survive cold temperatures better than males. Under an {FTR} of 11 °C (22 h)/ 20 °C (2 h) (average 11.8 °C) survival of females drastically increased compared to that at a constant temperature of 12 °C, whereas the survival of males increased slightly.

High-frequency temperature fluctuations caused no deviations from typical coevolutionary arms-race dynamics. However, coevolution was stalled during periods of high temperature under intermediate and low frequency fluctuations, generating temporary coevolutionary coldspots. Temperature variation affected population density, providing evidence that eco-evolutionary feedbacks act through variable bacteria-phage encounter rates. Our study shows that environmental fluctuations can drive antagonistic species interactions into and out of coevolutionary cold and hot spots.

            Complex environments, characterized by co-varying factors (e.g. temperature and food availability) may cause animals to invest resources differentially into fitness-related traits. Thus, experiments manipulating multiple environmental factors concurrently provide valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only important traits (e.g. dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also trait–trait interactions (e.g. trade-offs between traits). We used a multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant 28 °C vs. 28 ± 5 °C daily cycle) and food availability (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment. Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and food availability. We develop an experimental and statistical framework to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different life-history traits. This approach can be applied to a range of biological systems to investigate how environmental complexity influences traits and trait trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short- and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability ({\textgreater}20°C) and can be exposed to high levels of {UV}-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low {UV}-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24°C) or fluctuating temperatures (18–32°C) under high or low {UV}-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing {UV}-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and {UV}-B exposure. Temperature treatment and {UV}-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.},

	abstract = {Temperature and ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and {UVR} can cause cellular damage that result in the upregulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of {UVR} exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and {UVR} on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18 °C, constant 28 °C and daily ﬂuctuations between 18 and 28 °C) in the presence or absence of {UVR}. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits ({CTmax}), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that {CTmax} was inﬂuenced by an interactive effect between temperature and {UVR} treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to {UVR} led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing {CTmax}. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difﬁculty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation.},

We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species which differ naturally in their exposure to {DTF} raised in control (24°C) and {DTF} treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). {DTF} reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing {DTF} was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}15\%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats ({\textasciitilde}30\%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although {DTF} induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. {DTF} increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.891.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will likely be most affected.},

	abstract = {The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation’s exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably ﬂuctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong inﬂuence of both temperature ﬂuctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for ﬂies developed in both types of ﬂuctuating thermal environments compared with ﬂies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneﬁcial hardening when developing in either ﬂuctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, ﬂies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to ﬂies from the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably ﬂuctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of ﬂies in the unpredictably ﬂuctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.},

To examine whether incubation temperature ﬂuctuation has a key role in inﬂuencing the phenotype of hatchling Chinese skinks (Plestiodon chinensis), we incubated eggs produced by 20 females under ﬁve thermal regimes (treatments). Eggs in three treatments were incubated in three incubators, one set constant at 27 °C and two ramp-programmed at 27 7 3 °C and 27 75 °C on a cycle of 12 h ( þ) and 12 h ( À ). The remaining eggs were incubated in two chambers: one inside a room where temperatures varied from 23.0 to 31.1 °C, with a mean of 27.0 °C; the other outside the room where temperatures varied from 20.2 to 35.3 °C, with a mean of 26.1 °C. We found that: (1) for eggs at a given embryonic stage at ovipositon, the mean rather than the variance of incubation temperatures determined the length of incubation; (2) most (egg mass, embryonic stage at oviposition, incubation length and all examined hatchling traits except tail length and locomotor performance) of the examined variables were affected by clutch; and (3) body mass was the only hatchling trait that differed among the ﬁve treatments, but the differences were tiny. These ﬁndings suggest that incubation temperature ﬂuctuation has no direct role in inﬂuencing incubation length and hatchling phenotype in P. chinensis.},

As nests are subject to variations in temperature and most lab studies on crocodilian incubation have been carried out at constant temperatures, we were interested in determining how temperature fluctuations may affect the development of caiman embryos. We investigated the effects of incubation at constant temperatures (31°C, 32°C, and 33°C) and fluctuating temperatures (31 ± 2, 32 ± 1, and 32 ± 2°C) on the following aspects: incubation period duration, hatching success, sex ratio, total length, and body mass of C. latirostris hatchlings. Eggs incubated at 31°C produced 100\% females, those at 32°C produced 71.6\% females (however, the sex ratio was nest related), and at 33°C produced 100\% males. We found a masculinizing effect when incubation was at 31 ± 2°C compared with a constant 31°C; and temperature fluctuations at 32°C (32 ± 1 and 32 ± 2°C) had a negative effect on hatchlings size and mass, and hatching success compared with constant incubation temperatures of 32°C and 33°C. Finally, the effect of temperature variation during the incubation period on sex ratio, hatching success, and phenotype depends on the mean temperature, as the fluctuation around 31°C affected the sex ratios and incubation period, and the fluctuation around 32°C affected hatchling success and size.},

Heart rate variations were significant among the regimes (P {\textless} 0.05), with the median heart rate being highest for regime B (74 beats per minute or bpm) during the temperature insult (32 °C), relative to regime A (70 bpm) and the control (64 bpm). Notably, a suppression and inversion of the diurnal cardiac patterns occurred for regimes’ A and B crabs respectively, with rates from the highest temperature insult not shifting back to pre-insult levels during recovery (26 °C). It is plausible that P. dentata may have compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms that account for these differential heart rate responses, possibly conveying adaptive strategies in its dynamic habitat conditions.},

To explore these effects, E. vermicola cultured under five temperature ranges, 26°C, 15–26°C, 26–35°C, 20–30°C, and 15–35°C, were compared. The cultures grown at lower temperatures showed better growth, stronger tolerance to desiccation, {UV}, and H2O2 stresses, and increased catalase expression, However, these cultures also showed weaker heat stress tolerance and lower superoxide dismutase expression than the higher-temperature cultures. In particular, the E. vermicola cultured at 20–30°C, i.e., fluctuating in a narrow range around the optimal temperature, showed the best performance. Therefore, for production in practical applications, this narrowly fluctuating, moderate temperature appears to be optimal for yield and stress tolerance in E. vermicola.},

Thermal environment affects body temperature (Tb) that, in turn, has consequences both for the amount of time available for surface activities such as foraging, and for physiological processes such as metabolism. I studied effects of differences in thermal environment on Tb, surface use, and resting metabolism of mottled rock rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus) from two populations (Boquillas: {BOQ}, and Grapevine Hills: {GVH}) in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Snakes in these populations differed in growth rate and adult body size, and these differences may be related to the influence of thermal environment on energetics. During summer months, operative environmental temperatures at {BOQ} were hotter than at {GVH}. Hotter {BOQ} environmental temperatures resulted in -64\% less time available for diurnal surface use (e.g., foraging) at {BOQ} relative to {GVH}. Hotter {BOQ} environmental temperatures also constrained the average Tb of {BOQ} snakes at night to be from 2°C to 4.5°C hotter than {GVH} snakes during July and August. Despite hotter Tb, estimated resting metabolic expenditures of {BOQ} snakes during July and August were similar to estimated expenditures of {GVH} snakes because {BOQ} snakes had lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Results of this study were consistent with the hypothesis of greater energy limitation at {BOQ}, and underscored the importance of population-specific data for understanding geographic variation in energy acquisition and allocation.

	abstract = {Most organisms are exposed to bouts of warm temperatures during development, yet we know little about how variation in the timing and continuity of heat exposure influences biological processes. If heat waves increase in frequency and duration as predicted, it is necessary to understand how these bouts could affect thermally sensitive species, including reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination ({TSD}). In a multi-year study using fluctuating temperatures, we exposed
              Trachemys scripta
              embryos to cooler, male-producing temperatures interspersed with warmer, female-producing temperatures (heat waves) that varied in either timing during development or continuity and then analysed resulting sex ratios. We also quantified the expression of genes involved in testis differentiation (
              Dmrt1
              ) and ovary differentiation (
              Cyp19A1
              ) to determine how heat wave continuity affects the expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation. Heat waves applied during the middle of development produced significantly more females compared to heat waves that occurred just 7 days before or after this window, and even short gaps in the continuity of a heat wave decreased the production of females. Continuous heat exposure resulted in increased
              Cyp19A1
              expression while discontinuous heat exposure failed to increase expression in either gene over a similar time course. We report that even small differences in the timing and continuity of heat waves can result in drastically different phenotypic outcomes. This strong effect of temperature occurred despite the fact that embryos were exposed to the same number of warm days during a short period of time, which highlights the need to study temperature effects under more ecologically relevant conditions where temperatures may be elevated for only a few days at a time. In the face of a changing climate, the finding that subtle shifts in temperature exposure result in substantial effects on embryonic development becomes even more critical.},

	abstract = {Subterranean environments are characterized by the quasi absence of thermal variations (±1°C within a year), and organisms living in these biotopes for several millions of years, such as hypogean crustaceans, can be expected to have adapted to this very stable habitat. As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed, physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N. rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10°C all year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical responses during cold exposure (3°C). These seven populations showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be established between the amplitude of thermal variations and cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in subterranean crustaceans than in other arthropods.},

Because temperature also inﬂuences the activity rates of ﬁsh, it has the potential to alter the chronology of parental care activities and possibly the immediate or future reproductive success of individual ﬁsh. We conducted a study in a thermal efﬂuent canal on Lake Erie to examine the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuating thermal regimes on parental care and reproductive success of smallmouth bass. In general, parental care activity of these smallmouth bass was higher than previously reported for non-thermally altered environments and did not follow conventional stage-speciﬁc patterns. In fact, individual ﬁsh exhibited very different patterns, with no consistency among individuals. Despite these behavioral alterations and the thermal instability in the canal, the reproductive success of smallmouth bass (i.e., the percentage of nesting males that successfully produced freeswimming fry) was high relative to other published values. Behavioral alterations observed were variable and did not conform with theory. However, the high level of reproductive success implies that ﬁsh are capable of adjusting energetic expenditures in response to a suite of conditions and risks.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the variations of the temperature recorded in a tidal pool near the half-tide level, in a semilunadian regimen. A model of the temperature variations of the pool, based on diffusional exchange with the sea at high tide and with the air at low tide, shows good agreement with the experimental results. Fourier transform analysis of the variations of the main components of the frequency spectrum during a lunar cycle and for different values of the parameters (temperature variations of the air, level of the pool relative to the tide, exchange coefficients with the air and the ocean) reveals a complex structure. When the tidal component exists, it is stable in power and frequency, but is, in most cases, much smaller than the die1 peak. Barring the situations when the tide does not reach the pool for several days, the period of the pool is equal to 24.8 h (the first subharmonic of the tidal frequency), except for the part of the lunar cycle during which the high tide corresponds approximately to the extrema of air temperature: Then the period is lower than 24 h and the power decreases. Overall, the mean period is 24 h, which is coherent with the fact that the driving force of the temperature variations i s the sun, while its input in the pool is modulated by the tide. The same results can be applied, with a lesser amplitude of the temperature variations, to larger bodies of water. From these results, it is difficult to decide whether the temperature variations constitute a zeitgeber for circadian or circatidal clocks. The present conclusion is that this parameter seems to be, at best, a very unreliable synchronizer.

Reptiles inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental tem­ peratures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, phys­ iological traits exhibit intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations, tended to the “static” side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum. The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards than previously thought.},

These patterns can manifest along a coastline as well as across the continental shelf due to ecological interactions and environmental gradients. Several abiotic surrogates for environmental variables are hypothesised to structure high-latitude coral communities in South Africa along and across its narrow shelf and were investigated using a correlative approach that considered spatial autocorrelation. Surveys of sessile communities were conducted on 17 reefs and related to depth, distance to high tide, distance to the continental shelf edge and to submarine canyons. All four environmental variables were found to correlate signiﬁcantly with community composition, even after the effects of space were removed. The environmental variables accounted for 13\% of the variation in communities; 77\% of this variation was spatially structured. Spatially structured environmental variation unrelated to the environmental variables accounted for 39\% of the community variation. The Northern Reef Complex appears to be less affected by oceanic factors and may undergo less temperature variability than the Central and Southern Complexes; the ﬁrst is mentioned because it had the lowest canyon effect and was furthest from the continental shelf, whilst the latter complexes had the highest canyon effects and were closest to the shelf edge. These characteristics may be responsible for the spatial differences in the coral communities.},

	abstract = {To document the spatial and temporal variation of environmental signals inducing seed germination in temperate forests, we measured temporal patterns of environmental signals and seed germination of six pioneer tree species in unthinned and thinned stands of conifer forests (Cryptomeria japonica plantations) and in the understory and gaps of hardwood forests in Japan. We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:{FR}) light ratio and temperature ﬂuctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon ﬂux density ({PPFD}), the R:{FR} ratio, and the amplitude of temperature ﬂuctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The {PPFD} and R:{FR} ratios just above forest ﬂoor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These ﬁndings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. In this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:{FR} ratios and/or large temperature ﬂuctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the {PPFD} and magnitude of temperature ﬂuctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals, {PPFD}, R:{FR} ratio, and the amplitude of temperature ﬂuctuations, appear to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent species diversity.},

In marine ecosystems, the importance of marine heatwaves ({MHWs}) — discrete periods of anomalously high sea temperatures — is gaining recognition.

The {MHW} was associated with widespread mortality of habitat-forming species, including corals and kelps, and structural changes in assemblages of macroalgae and fish. However, the responses of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages have not yet been fully documented. Here, we resurveyed 2 subtidal habitat types (reef ‘flats’ and ‘slopes’) at 4 locations (spanning {\textgreater} 800 km of coastline and {\textgreater} 6° of latitude) during the period 1999−2015 to examine the effects of the 2011 {MHW} on herbivorous macroinvertebrates (i.e. sea urchins, gastropod molluscs). Responses to the {MHW} varied with latitude; at our warmest study location, abundances were severely depleted, whereas no effects were detected at the coolest location. Across the entire study region, subtle but significant shifts in assemblage structure were observed due to decreased abundances of more southerly-distributed species (i.e. ‘cool’ affinity) and increased abundances of several more northerly-distributed species (i.e. ‘warm’ affinity). The 2011 {MHW} has had profound effects on the marine biota off the west coast of Australia, across multiple trophic levels and taxonomic groups. Here, as in many other regions, contemporary warming events are superimposed onto gradual warming trends, increasing the likelihood of abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning.},

This species is able to tolerate wide seawater temperature ﬂuctuations and sedimentation stress, but its reproductive status at high latitudes and under marginal environmental conditions is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the reproductive potential of S. siderea along a latitudinal gradient (25°–27°N) and to determine if sexual maturity occurs in small ({\textless}12.0 cm) S. siderea colonies. Samples of coral tissue were collected in 2007, 2008, and 2009 at three sites along the latitudinal gradient and were processed for histological analysis. Oocyte size, volume, and abundance were used to calculate fecundity. Results showed that fecundity decreased with increasing latitude and that oocyte volume was the major contributing factor to this variation. Mature oocytes were observed in S. siderea colonies at sizes as small as 1.1 cm in diameter. The ability of S. siderea to reach fertility at high latitude areas suggests this species is able to reproduce under marginal environmental conditions; however, reduction in oocyte size could increase local retention of larvae. The presence of mature oocytes in small colonies suggests that stress can reduce somatic growth and shift sexual maturity to smaller colony sizes.},

The animals were then examined under three equal 4-day periods: ad libitum feeding, fasting and re-feeding. Through the analysis of daily as well as short-term, or ultradian, variations of body temperature, we showed that while ducklings at {TN} show only a modest decline in daily thermoregulatory parameters when fasted, they exhibit reduced surface temperatures from key sites of vascular heat exchange during fasting. The {CA} birds, on the other hand, significantly reduced their short-term variations of body temperature while increasing long-term variability when fasting. This phenomenon would allow the {CA} birds to reduce the energetic cost of body temperature maintenance under fasting. By analysing ultradian regulation of body temperature, we describe a means by which an endotherm appears to lower thermoregulatory costs in response to the combined stressors of cold and fasting.},

	abstract = {The response of coral-reef ecosystems to contemporary thermal stress may be in part a consequence of recent or historical sea-surface temperature ({SST}) variability. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether: (i) there was a relationship between the historical frequency of {SST} variability and stress experienced during the most recent thermal-stress events (in 1998 and 2005–2006) and (ii) coral reefs that historically experienced frequent thermal anomalies were less likely to experience coral bleaching during these recent thermal-stress events. Examination of nine detrended coral δ
              18
              O and Sr/Ca anomaly records revealed a high- (5.7-year) and low-frequency ({\textgreater}54-year) mode of {SST} variability. There was a positive relationship between the historical frequency of {SST} anomalies and recent thermal stress; sites historically dominated by the high-frequency mode experienced greater thermal stress than other sites during both events, and showed extensive coral bleaching in 1998. Nonetheless, in 2005–2006, corals at sites dominated by high-frequency variability showed reduced bleaching, despite experiencing high thermal stress. This bleaching resistance was most likely a consequence of rapid directional selection that followed the extreme thermal event of 1998. However, the benefits of regional resistance could come at the considerable cost of shifts in coral species composition.},

	abstract = {Background: Many organisms are responding to climate change with dramatic range shifts, involving plastic and genetic changes to cope with novel climate regimes found at higher latitudes. Using experimental lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel climates.
Results: We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however, associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions, resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast, lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold tolerances and no evolved response.
Conclusions: We propose that thermal adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.},

Organisms exposed to high temperature stresses typically protect themselves with a heat shock response ({HSR}), where accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates the synthesis of heat shock proteins through the heat shock transcription factor {HSF}1. While the molecular mechanisms are qualitatively well characterized, our quantitative understanding of the underlying dynamics is still very limited. Here, we study the dynamics of {HSR} in the photosynthetic model organism
              Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
              with a data-driven mathematical model of {HSR}. We based our dynamical model mostly on mass action kinetics, with a few nonlinear terms. The model was parametrized and validated by several independent datasets obtained from the literature. We demonstrate that {HSR} quantitatively and significantly differs if an increase in temperature of the same magnitude occurs abruptly, as often applied under laboratory conditions, or gradually, which would rather be expected under natural conditions. In contrast to rapid temperature increases, under gradual changes only negligible amounts of misfolded proteins accumulate, indicating that the {HSR} of
              C. reinhardtii
              efficiently avoids the accumulation of misfolded proteins under conditions most likely to prevail in nature. The mathematical model we developed is a flexible tool to simulate the {HSR} to different conditions and complements the current experimental approaches.},

We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that {TPCs} are ﬁxed during ontogeny, one can measure {TPCs} for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-speciﬁc ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the assumptions underlying the integration of {TPCs} with Tb, to develop a framework within which empiricists can place their work within these limitations, and to facilitate the application of thermal physiology to understanding the biological implications of climate change.},

	abstract = {Early environments can profoundly inﬂuence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges’ g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: {\textbar}g{\textbar} = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this inﬂuence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = −8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact ﬁtness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6◦C versus 2◦C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments ﬂuctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.},

	abstract = {The biomass of marine consumers increased during the Phanerozoic. This is indicated by the increase in both fleshiness and average size of individuals of dominant organisms, coupled with the conservative estimate that dominant organisms in the Cenozoic are at least as abundant as those in the Paleozoic. As faunal dominants replaced one another during the Phanerozoic the general level of metabolic activity increased due to both increase in basal metabolism and increase in more energetic modes of life. This demonstrates that the expenditure of energy by marine consumers has increased with time as well. There is a time lag in the expansion of more energetic life habits from environmental settings known to have high food supply into regions expected to have lower rates of food supply (e.g., bivalves into offshore carbonate environments or deep burrowing deposit feeders into the full range of shelf environments), and a time lag in diversification of energetic modes of life (e.g., predation or deep burrowing deposit feeding) for long intervals after they first appeared. This suggests that the supply of food increased across the whole spectrum of marine habitats during the Phanerozoic. The great diversification of specialized predators especially suggests that biomass increase took place all the way down the food chain to the level of primary production. The development of plant life on land and the impact of land vegetation on stimulating productivity in coastal marine settings, coupled with the transfer of organic material and nutrients from coastal regions to the open ocean, and the increase through time in diversity and abundance of oceanic phytoplankton all point to increased productivity in the oceans through the Phanerozoic.},

None of the descriptors of thermal sensitivity examined (optimal temperature, optimum performance breadth, preferred temperature, and acclimation response) correlates with the observed thermal niche of L. tasmaniensis. Successful exploitation of temporally variable thermal environments by anurans need not be associated with temperature independence of locomotor perfomance around ecologically relevant Tb.},

For instance, how will climate change alter complex, multi-species relationships that are modulated by climatic variation and that underlie ecosystem-level processes? Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a keystone species in Newfoundland, Canada, provides a useful model for unravelling potential and complex long-term implications of climate change on biotic interactions and population change. We measured cause-specific caribou calf predation (1990–2013) in Newfoundland relative to seasonal weather patterns. We show that black bear (Ursus americanus) predation is facilitated by time-lagged higher summer growing degree days, whereas coyote (Canis latrans) predation increases with current precipitation and winter temperature. Based on future climate forecasts for the region, we illustrate that, through time, coyote predation on caribou calves could become increasingly important, whereas the influence of black bear would remain unchanged. From these predictions, demographic projections for caribou suggest long-term population limitation specifically through indirect effects of climate change on calf predation rates by coyotes. While our work assumes limited impact of climate change on other processes, it illustrates the range of impact that climate change can have on predator–prey interactions. We conclude that future efforts to predict potential effects of climate change on populations and ecosystems should include assessment of both direct and indirect effects, including climate–predator interactions.},

Evolutionary biology has relied ever increasingly on the modeling of population dynamics. Most have taken for granted that we all agree on what is a population. Recent work has reexamined this perceived consensus. I will argue that there are good reasons to restrict the term ‘‘population’’ to collections of monophyletically related replicators and interactors, which explains why many existing models in population biology exclude by deﬁnition many genuine evolving biological individuals such as communities and ecosystems. By studying a case of community evolution (a symbiotic termite–fungus community), we will see that it is variation that is important to evolutionary processes, not populations. Variation within a population is only one of many types of variation that can lead to evolution by natural selection. The upshot of focusing on variation is that cases of community and ecosystem adaptive change become tractable in evolutionary terms. I will show that complex emergent individuals such as communities and ecosystems cannot be fully accommodated by conventional population/reproduction models but can be accommodated by variation/persistence models.},

In particular, do the optimal temperatures and thermal niches of the bacterial ﬂora reﬂect seasonal, geographic, or phylogenetic differences in their hosts’ temperatures? We examined these questions by measuring the relationship between the temperaturedependent growth rates of enteric bacteria in a free-living ectothermic host. We sampled two species of enteric bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) from three natural populations of slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) seasonally over two years. Despite pronounced differences in turtle body temperatures at different seasons and in different locations, we found no evidence that the thermal growth proﬁles of these bacteria mirrored this variation. Optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates in rich medium were nearly the same for both bacterial species (35–36{ЊC}, 2.5 doublings per hour). The thermal niche (deﬁned as the range of temperatures over which 75\% of maximal growth rate occurred) was slightly higher for E. coli (28.5–41.0{ЊC}) than for S. enterica (27.7–39.8{ЊC}), but the niche breadth was about the same for both. We also measured the thermal dependence of growth rate in these same bacterial species isolated from mammalian hosts. Both bacterial species had temperatures of maximal growth and thermal niches that were about 2{ЊC} higher than those of their respective conspeciﬁcs sampled from turtles; niche breadths were not different. These data suggest that these bacterial species are thermal generalists that do not track ﬁne-scale changes in their thermal environments. Even major differences in body temperatures, as great as those between ectothermic and endothermic hosts, may result in the evolution of rather modest changes in thermal properties.},

However, many environmental changes, especially those involving weather (as opposed to climate), are often stochastic, variable and extreme, particularly in temperate terrestrial or freshwater habitats. Moreover, few studies of animal and plant phenotypic plasticity employ realistic (i.e. short-term, stochastic) environmental change in their protocols. Here, I posit that the frequently abrupt environmental changes (days, weeks, months) accompanying much longer-term general climate change (e.g. global warming over decades or centuries) require consideration of the true nature of environmental change (as opposed to statistical means) coupled with an expansion of focus to consider developmental phenotypic plasticity. Such plasticity can be in multiple forms – obligatory/ facultative, beneficial/deleterious – depending upon the degree and rate of environmental variability at specific points in organismal development. Essentially, adult phenotypic plasticity, as important as it is, will be irrelevant if developing offspring lack sufficient plasticity to create modified phenotypes necessary for survival.},

Macroecology theory, which deals with large scale relationships between ecology and biogeography, can be used to develop models to predict the effects of global changes on marine species that in turn affect their fisheries. First, based on theories linking trophic energetics and allometric scaling of metabolism, we developed a theoretical model that relates maximum catch potential from a species to its trophic level, geographic range, and mean primary production within the species’ exploited range. Then, using this theoretical model and data from 1000 species of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates, we analyzed the empirical relationship between species’ approximated maximum catch potential, their ecology, and biogeography variables. Additional variables are included in the empirical model to correct for biases resulting from the uncertainty inherent in the original catch data. The empirical model has high explanatory power and agrees with theoretical expectations. In the future, this empirical model can be combined with a bioclimate envelope model to predict the socio-economic impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. Such potential application is illustrated here with an example pertaining to the small yellow croaker Larimichthys polyactis (Sciaenidae) from the East China Sea.},

	abstract = {In this review we consider how small-scale temporal and spatial variation in body temperature, and biochemical/physiological variation among individuals, affect the prediction of organisms’ performance in nature. For ‘normal’ body temperatures – benign temperatures near the species’ mean – thermal biology traditionally uses performance curves to describe how physiological capabilities vary with temperature. However, these curves, which are typically measured under static laboratory conditions, can yield incomplete or inaccurate predictions of how organisms respond to natural patterns of temperature variation. For example, scale transition theory predicts that, in a variable environment, peak average performance is lower and occurs at a lower mean temperature than the peak of statically measured performance. We also demonstrate that temporal variation in performance is minimized near this new ‘optimal’ temperature. These factors add complexity to predictions of the consequences of climate change. We then move beyond the performance curve approach to consider the effects of rare, extreme temperatures. A statistical procedure (the environmental bootstrap) allows for longterm simulations that capture the temporal pattern of extremes (a Poisson interval distribution), which is characterized by clusters of events interspersed with long intervals of benign conditions. The bootstrap can be combined with biophysical models to incorporate temporal, spatial and physiological variation into evolutionary models of thermal tolerance. We conclude with several challenges that must be overcome to more fully develop our understanding of thermal performance in the context of a changing climate by explicitly considering different forms of small-scale variation. These challenges highlight the need to empirically and rigorously test existing theories.},

However, even in cases where we have detailed knowledge of current species’ range boundaries, we often do not understand what, if any, aspects of weather and climate act to set these limits. This shortcoming significantly curtails our capacity to predict potential future range shifts in response to climate change, especially since the factors that set range boundaries under those novel conditions may be different from those that set limits today. We quantitatively examine a nine-year time series of temperature records relevant to the body temperatures of intertidal mussels as measured using biomimetic sensors. Specifically, we explore how a ‘climatology’ of body temperatures, as opposed to long-term records of habitat-level parameters such as air and water temperatures, can be used to extrapolate meaningful spatial and temporal patterns of physiological stress. Using different metrics that correspond to various aspects of physiological stress (seasonal means, cumulative temperature and the return time of extremes) we show that these potential environmental stressors do not always occur in synchrony with one another. Our analysis also shows that patterns of animal temperature are not well correlated with simple, commonly used metrics such as air temperature. Detailed physiological studies can provide guidance to predicting the effects of global climate change on natural ecosystems but only if we concomitantly record, archive and model environmental signals at appropriate scales.},

Studies investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation among populations of different latitudes allow a prediction of the potential impact of prospective increases in environmental temperatures on their fitness.
Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, temperature reaction norms were ascertained among 18 genetically defined, natural clones of the microbial eukaryote Paramecium caudatum. These different clones have been isolated from 12 freshwater habitats along a latitudinal transect in Europe and from 3 tropical habitats (Indonesia). The sensitivity to increasing temperatures was estimated through the analysis of clone specific thermal tolerances and by relating those to current and predicted temperature data of their natural habitats. All investigated European clones seem to be thermal generalists with a broad thermal tolerance and similar optimum temperatures. The weak or missing co-variation of thermal tolerance with latitude does not imply local adaptation to thermal gradients; it rather suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity among the whole European subpopulation. The tested Indonesian clones appear to be locally adapted to the less variable, tropical temperature regime and show higher tolerance limits, but lower tolerance breadths.
Conclusions/Significance: Due to the lack of local temperature adaptation within the European subpopulation, P. caudatum genotypes at the most southern edge of their geographic range seem to suffer from the predicted increase in magnitude and frequency of summer heat waves caused by climate change.},

	abstract = {Most of the thermal tolerance studies on fish have been performed on juveniles and adults, whereas limited information is available for larvae, a stage which may have a particularly narrow range in tolerable temperatures. Moreover, previous studies on thermal limits for marine and freshwater fish larvae (53 studies reviewed here) applied a wide range of methodologies (e.g. the static or dynamic method, different exposure times), making it challenging to compare across taxa. We measured the Critical Thermal Maximum ({CTmax}) of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae using the dynamic method (ramping assay) and assessed the effect of warming rate (0.5 to 9˚C h-1) and acclimation temperature. The larvae of herring had a lower {CTmax} (lowest and highest values among 222 individual larvae, 13.1–27.0˚C) than seabass (lowest and highest values among 90 individual larvae, 24.2–34.3˚C). At faster rates of warming, larval {CTmax} significantly increased in herring, whereas no effect was observed in seabass. Higher acclimation temperatures led to higher {CTmax} in herring larvae (2.7 ± 0.9˚C increase) with increases more pronounced at lower warming rates. Pre-trials testing the effects of warming rate are recommended. Our results for these two temperate marine fishes suggest using a warming rate of 3–6˚C h-1: {CTmax} is highest in trials of relatively short duration, as has been suggested for larger fish. Additionally, time-dependent thermal tolerance was observed in herring larvae, where a difference of up to 8˚C was observed in the upper thermal limit between a 0.5- or 24-h exposure to temperatures {\textgreater}18˚C. The present study constitutes a first step towards a standard protocol for measuring thermal tolerance in larval fish.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity plays a key role in modulating how environmental variation influences population dynamics, but we have only rudimentary understanding of how plasticity interacts with the magnitude and predictability of environmental variation to affect population dynamics and persistence. We developed a stochastic individual-based model, in which phenotypes could respond to a temporally fluctuating environmental cue and fitness depended on the match between the phenotype and a randomly fluctuating trait optimum, to assess the absolute fitness and population dynamic consequences of plasticity under different levels of environmental stochasticity and cue reliability. When cue and optimum were tightly correlated, plasticity buffered absolute fitness from environmental variability, and population size remained high and relatively invariant. In contrast, when this correlation weakened and environmental variability was high, strong plasticity reduced population size, and populations with excessively strong plasticity had substantially greater extinction probability. Given that environments might become more variable and unpredictable in the future owing to anthropogenic influences, reaction norms that evolved under historic selective regimes could imperil populations in novel or changing environmental contexts. We suggest that demographic models (e.g. population viability analyses) would benefit from a more explicit consideration of how phenotypic plasticity influences population responses to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Performance curves of physiological rates are not fixed, and determining the extent to which thermal performance curves can change in response to environmental signals is essential to understand the effect of climate variability on populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether and how temperatures experienced during early embryonic development affect thermal performance curves of later life history stages in the frog Limnodynastes peronii. We tested the hypotheses that a) the embryonic environment affects mean trait values only; b) temperature at which performance of tadpoles is maximal shifts with egg incubation temperatures so that performance is maximised at the incubation temperatures, and c) incubation temperatures modulate the capacity for reversible acclimation in tadpoles. Growth rates were greater in warm (25uC) compared to cold (15uC) acclimated (6 weeks) tadpoles regardless of egg developmental temperatures (15uC or 25uC, representing seasonal means). The breadth of the performance curve of burst locomotor performance (measured at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30uC, representing annual range) is greatest when egg developmental and acclimation temperatures coincide. The mode of the performance curves shifted with acclimation conditions and maximum performance was always at higher temperatures than acclimation conditions. Performance curves of glycolytic (lactate dehydrogenase activities) and mitochondrial (citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase) enzymes were modulated by interactions between egg incubation and acclimation temperatures. Lactate dehydrogenase activity paralleled patterns seen in burst locomotor performance, but oxygen consumption rates and mitochondrial enzyme activities did not mirror growth or locomotor performance. We show that embryonic developmental conditions can modulate performance curves of later life-history stages, thereby conferring flexibilty to respond to environmental conditions later in life.},

	abstract = {Predicting the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change requires a variety of approaches, including the use of experiments, models, and surveys. Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity.},

We conducted comparative studies and thermal acclimation experiments on the locomotion of the Chinese skink (Plestiodon chinensis) to test whether seasonal acclimatisation in locomotion exists in these terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, and whether seasonal acclimatisation is predominantly induced by thermal environments. In natural populations, skinks ran faster during the summer season than during the spring season at high-test temperatures ranging from 27°C to 36°C but not at low-test temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C. In contrast, the thermal acclimation experiments showed that the cold-acclimated skinks ran faster than the warm-acclimated skinks at the lowtest temperatures but not at high-test temperatures. Therefore, the seasonal acclimatisation occurs to P. chinensis, and may be induced by temperature as well as other factors like food availability, as indicated by the seasonal variation in the thermal dependence of locomotion, and the discrepancy between seasonal acclimatisation and thermal acclimation on locomotion.},

Speciﬁcally, the framework addresses how fragmentation changes temperature and how the effects of those temperature changes spread through the ecosystem, from organism response via thermal sensitivity, to changes in species distribution and activity patterns, to shifts in community structure following species’ responses, and ultimately to changes in ecosystem functions. We place a strong emphasis on future research directions by outlining “Critical gaps” for each step of the framework. Empirical efforts to apply and test this framework promise new understanding of fragmentation’s ecological consequences and new strategies for conservation in an increasingly fragmented and warmer world.},

T. scripta elegans hatchlings could swim faster (but righted themselves more slowly), and tolerate a higher temperature and wider temperature range than M. reevesii hatchlings. Similarly, T. scripta elegans hatchlings had a greater maximal performance (Pmax) value for swimming speed (but a lower Pmax value for righting time) than M. reevesii hatchlings. Temperature acclimation had a significant impact on the thermal tolerance and locomotor ability of turtles, but the acclimation effect did not differ between the two species. T. scripta elegans hatchlings seemed to have a greater thermal plasticity than M. reevesii hatchlings. High-latitude individuals showed a greater low-temperature tolerance, but lower locomotor ability (longer righting time) than low-latitude ones. However, the thermal plasticity did not differ between latitudinal cohorts. Our results indicated that T. scripta elegans performed better than M. reevesii, which might contribute to its range expansion and invasive success.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Ectotherms are sensitive to the changes in ambient temperature with respect to their physiology and development. To compensate for the effects of variation in temperature, ectotherms exhibit physiological plasticity which can be for short or long term. An extensive body of literature exists towards understanding these effects and the solutions ectotherms have evolved. However, to what extent rearing temperature during early life stages impacts the behaviour expressed in adulthood is less clearly understood. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of developmental temperature on life-history traits and mating call features in a tropical field cricket,
            Acanthogryllus asiaticus
            . We raised
            A. asiaticus
            at two different developmental conditions: 25°C and 30°C. We found developmental time and adult lifespan of individuals reared at 30°C to be shorter than those at 25°C. Increased developmental temperature influenced various body size parameters differentially. Males raised at 30°C were found to be larger and heavier than those raised at 25°C, making
            A. asiaticus
            an exception to the temperature-size rule. We found a significant effect of the change in immediate ambient temperature on different call features of both field-caught and lab-bred individuals. In addition, developmental temperature also affected mating call features as individuals raised at higher temperature produced faster calls with a higher peak frequency compared to those raised at lower temperature. However, the interaction of both developmental and immediate temperature on mating calls showed differential effects. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how environmental temperature shapes life-history and sexual communication in crickets.},

	abstract = {Understanding how environmental variability (or randomness) affects evolution is of fundamental importance for biology. The presence of temporal or spatial variability significantly affects the competition dynamics in populations, and gives rise to some counterintuitive observations. In this paper, we consider both birth–death ({BD}) or death–birth ({DB}) Moran processes, which are set up on a circular or a complete graph. We investigate spatial and temporal variability affecting division and/or death parameters. Assuming that mutant and wild-type fitness parameters are drawn from an identical distribution, we study mutant fixation probability and timing. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial types of variability possess fundamentally different properties. Under temporal randomness, in a completely mixed system, minority mutants experience (i) higher than neutral fixation probability and a higher mean conditional fixation time, if the division rates are affected by randomness and (ii) lower fixation probability and lower mean conditional fixation time if the death rates are affected. Once spatial restrictions are imposed, however, these effects completely disappear, and mutants in a circular graph experience neutral dynamics, but only for the {DB} update rule in case (i) and for the {BD} rule in case (ii) above. In contrast to this, in the case of spatially variable environment, both for {BD}/{DB} processes, both for complete/circular graph and both for division/death rates affected, minority mutants experience a higher than neutral probability of fixation. Fixation time, however, is increased by randomness on a circle, while it decreases for complete graphs under random division rates. A basic difference between temporal and spatial kinds of variability is the types of correlations that occur in the system. Under temporal randomness, mutants are spatially correlated with each other (they simply have equal fitness values at a given moment of time; the same holds for wild-types). Under spatial randomness, there are subtler, temporal correlations among mutant and wild-type cells, which manifest themselves by cells of each type ‘claiming’ better spots for themselves. Applications of this theory include cancer generation and biofilm dynamics.},

We find that all species in food webs exposed to temporally uncorrelated environments (white noise) show the same type of dynamics as isolated species, whereas species in food webs exposed to positively autocorrelated environments (red noise) can respond completely differently compared with isolated species. This is owing to species following their equilibrium densities in a positively autocorrelated environment that in turn enables species–species interactions to come into play. Our results give new insights into species' response to environmental variation. They especially highlight the importance of considering both species' interactions and environmental autocorrelation when studying population dynamics in a fluctuating environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent temperature extremes have highlighted the importance of assessing projected changes in the variability of temperature as well as the mean. A large fraction of present-day temperature variance is associated with thermal advection, as anomalous winds blow across the land–sea temperature contrast, for instance. Models project robust heterogeneity in the twenty-first-century warming pattern under greenhouse gas forcing, resulting in land–sea temperature contrasts increasing in summer and decreasing in winter and the pole-to-equator temperature gradient weakening in winter. In this study, future changes in monthly variability of near-surface temperature in the 17-member ensemble {ESSENCE} (Ensemble Simulations of Extreme Weather Events under Nonlinear Climate Change) are assessed. In winter, variability in midlatitudes decreases whereas in very high latitudes and the tropics it increases. In summer, variability increases over most land areas and in the tropics, with decreasing variability in high latitude oceans. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the contributions to variability changes from changing temperature gradients and circulation patterns. Thermal advection is found to be of particular importance in the Northern Hemisphere winter midlatitudes, where the change in mean state temperature gradients alone could account for over half the projected changes. Changes in thermal advection are also found to be important in summer in Europe and coastal areas, although less so than in winter. Comparison with {CMIP}5 data shows that the midlatitude changes in variability are robust across large regions, particularly high northern latitudes in winter and middle northern latitudes in summer.},

With this information in hand, biologists can predict organisms most at risk from environmental change. Biologists and managers can then target organisms and habitats most at risk. Unfortunately, the required data (e.g. optimal physiological temperatures) are rarely available. Here, we evaluate the reliability of potential proxies (e.g. critical temperatures) that are often available for some groups. Several proxies for ectotherms are promising, but analogous ones for endotherms are lacking. We also develop a simple graphical model of how behavioural thermoregulation, acclimation and adaptation may interact to influence vulnerability over time. After considering this model together with the proxies available for physiological sensitivity to climate change, we conclude that ectotherms sharing vulnerability traits seem concentrated in lowland tropical forests. Their vulnerability may be exacerbated by negative biotic interactions. Whether tropical forest (or other) species can adapt to warming environments is unclear, as genetic and selective data are scant. Nevertheless, the prospects for tropical forest ectotherms appear grim.},

Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae

              exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasticity's interactions with ecological dynamics. Amidst the current emphasis on rapid evolution, it is critical that we also develop predictive methods accounting for plasticity.},

	abstract = {Variability in the environment defines the structure and dynamics of all living systems, from organisms to ecosystems. Species have evolved traits and strategies that allow them to detect, exploit and predict the changing environment. These traits allow organisms to maintain steady internal conditions required for physiological functioning through feedback mechanisms that allow internal conditions to remain at or near a set-point despite a fluctuating environment. In addition to feedback, many organisms have evolved feedforward processes, which allow them to adjust in anticipation of an expected future state of the environment. Here we provide a framework describing how feedback and feedforward mechanisms operating within organisms can generate effects across scales of organization, and how they allow living systems to persist in fluctuating environments. Daily, seasonal and multi-year cycles provide cues that organisms use to anticipate changes in physiologically relevant environmental conditions. Using feedforward mechanisms, organisms can exploit correlations in environmental variables to prepare for anticipated future changes. Strategies to obtain, store and act on information about the conditional nature of future events are advantageous and are evidenced in widespread phenotypes such as circadian clocks, social behaviour, diapause and migrations. Humans are altering the ways in which the environment fluctuates, causing correlations between environmental variables to become decoupled, decreasing the reliability of cues. Human-induced environmental change is also altering sensory environments and the ability of organisms to detect cues. Recognizing that living systems combine feedback and feedforward processes is essential to understanding their responses to current and future regimes of environmental fluctuations.

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities are typically open to the immigration and emigration of individuals, and also variable through time. In this paper we argue that interesting and potentially important effects arise when one splices together spatial ﬂuxes and temporal variability. The particular system we examine is a sink habitat, where a species faces deterministic extinction but is rescued by recurrent immigration. We have shown, using a simple extension of the canonical exponential growth model in a time-varying environment, that variation ‘‘inﬂates’’ the average abundance of sink populations. We can analytically quantify the magnitude of this effect in several special cases (square-wave temporal variation and Gaussian stochastic variation). The inﬂationary effect can be large in ‘‘intermittent’’ sinks (where there are periods with positive growth), and when temporal variation is strongly autocorrelated. The effect appears to be robust to incorporation of demographic stochasticity (due to discrete birth–death–immigration processes), and to direct density dependence. With discrete generations, however, one can observe a wide range of effects of temporal variation, including depression as well as inﬂation. We argue that the inﬂationary effect of temporal variation in sink habitats can have important implications for community structure, because it can increase the average abundance (and hence local impacts) of species that on average are being excluded from a local community. We illustrate the latter effect using a familiar model of exploitative competition for a single limiting resource. We demonstrate that temporal variation can reverse local competitive dominance, even to the extent of allowing an inferior competitor maintained by immigration to exclude a competing species that would be locally superior in a constant environment.},

	abstract = {The environmental conditions in the ocean have long been considered relatively more stable through time compared to the conditions on land. Advances in sensing technologies, however, are increasingly revealing substantial fluctuations in abiotic factors over ecologically and evolutionarily relevant timescales in the ocean, leading to a growing recognition of the dynamism of the marine environment as well as new questions about how this dynamism may influence species' vulnerability to global environmental change. In some instances, the diurnal or seasonal variability in major environmental change drivers, such as temperature, {pH} and seawater carbonate chemistry, and dissolved oxygen, can exceed the changes expected with continued anthropogenic global change. While ocean global change biologists have begun to experimentally test how variability in environmental conditions mediates species' responses to changes in the mean, the extensive literature on species' adaptations to temporal variability in their environment and the implications of this variability for their evolutionary responses has not been well integrated into the field. Here, we review the physiological mechanisms underlying species' responses to changes in temperature, {pCO}2/{pH} (and other carbonate parameters), and dissolved oxygen, and discuss what is known about behavioral, plastic, and evolutionary strategies for dealing with variable environments. In addition, we discuss how exposure to variability may influence species' responses to changes in the mean conditions and highlight key research needs for ocean global change biology.},

	abstract = {Early environments can profoundly inﬂuence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges’ g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: {\textbar}g{\textbar} = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this inﬂuence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = −8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact ﬁtness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6◦C versus 2◦C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments ﬂuctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.},

Although recent work suggests that changes in temperature variation will have disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean, much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections (2050–2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and projecting performance.},

Analysis of phytoplankton abundance within a 140-m isothermal layer gave no evidence of vertical stratification. Abundances of many species were strongly nonrandom, but there was no consistency of vertical pattern from one station to the next. The situation is better described in terms of vertical patches than of strata.},

	abstract = {Adding ﬂuctuations to models of resource competition provides one solution to Hutchinson’s paradox. Fundamental to ﬂuctuation dependent mechanisms of coexistence are differential species’ responses to environmental ﬂuctuations through time. The covariance between the environment and competition this generates leads to compensatory population dynamics, now thought to be important for community stability. We tested this theory experimentally using freshwater diatoms. We measured the growth of Cyclotella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria crotonensis over a range of temperatures. Cyclotella showed a higher growth rate and higher silicate assimilation rate between 6{ЊC} and 18{ЊC}, while Fragilaria showed greater competitive ability above 18{ЊC}. These results were used to parameterize a resource competition model. Numerical simulation of this model predicted stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under ﬂuctuating but not constant temperature. A long-term competition experiment with Cyclotella and Fragilaria conﬁrmed the predictions of the model. These results demonstrate the role abiotic ﬂuctuations may play in maintaining the diversity of natural communities.},
